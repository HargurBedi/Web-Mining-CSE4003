Even though I went at dinner time, I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs and sour dough toast along with an Irish coffee. Mark was my waiter and provided excellent service. Everything was perfect and absolutely delicious. Top it all off with the sunset view from my table and to say I enjoyed the evening is an understatement. I highly recommend you visit this place.

This is the place to go to have the best Irish Coffee. it is a one of kind experience and should be on everyone's list whether its your first time at the Buena Vista or your hundredth time. There is always a lively crowd and getting to the bar can sometimes be a challenge but do not be deterred, its a fun place and everyone is in a good mood.

Historic home of "Irish Coffe'
Rating: 5

Buena Vista means good view and this historic (since 1916) bar/ restaurant has commanding views of the Powell and Hyde Cable car turntable, the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay. It is documented that the Irish Coffee was invented here in 1952 and if you grab a stool at the long wood bar, you'll get to watch the master bartenders make a line of as many of 20 of the whiskey laced coffees crowned with cream at a time. On a chilly foggy night there is no better way to warm up. The menu has a range of food options from burgers to pasta, seafood to steaks.

I was told that this was a must stop location while I'm out here in San Francisco. We went there on October 15th, 2017 and the service was great. We were greeted immediately and ordered our Irish Coffees and they were ready in a matter of minutes.I'd highly recommend the Buena Vista Cafe as they have quite a history and the Irish Coffee is simply an amazing drink. It would be a must visit for me on my next trip out.

Stopped by on a friends recommendation. Great atmosphere & staff. The bar was jamming. Very old school feel right down to the bartenders uniforms. They specialize in Irish Coffees. The glasses literally line the bar as they make them & top with fresh whipped cream. The atmosphere only makes them taste that much more delicious!

We've been here a few times and usually after a swim in Aquatic Park. It's a fun tourist joint with claims to have invented Irish Coffee.. Yeah sure, whatever.

This landmark cafe at the end of the Powell-Hyde cable car route, near Fisherman's Wharf, claims to have invented the Irish Coffee. Generally packed for breakfast, it's seat yourself, but not at the bar, which doesn't serve food, so grab a seat at any table that has an empty seat or two, and greet your fellow diners. The food is decidedly mediocre, so everyone has 2 or 3 Irish Coffees and leaves happy.

The spot was bustling even at 2:00 PM on a Friday!! It is loud and packed. However it does move fast. You seat yourself- so as soon as you enter try to get a table. Nobody tells you so or seats you! There are more tables in the back room and it is much quieter. We took our kids (5 & 3) and both did great!Location is super convenient and has great views! Irish coffee and regular coffee is great. Food is OK. Service is fast but just OK.

Absolutely delicious.Apparently customers come from everywhere to have an Irish coffee and they sell lots of them.You must drop in and try one.An added bonus is across the road is the starting point for the cable cars so one can enjoy watching them as well.

As so many others have said, it's a busy tourist spot right by the long lines for the cable car. That said, it's like the Golden Gate bridge, when one is in SF you gotta go and have an Irish Coffee as the sun is going down and the breeze picks up. That whipped cream is fantastic on your lips, and the hot coffee going down your throat as you deal with the throngs of people trying to get in or out...it's part of the SF experience.

The breakfasts were very good. The service the first time we went was great - the waitress was friendly, helpful, and efficient. The second time we went, the service was horrible. We had a different waitress who had a very bad attitude - rude, arrogant, and obnoxious. Also, instead of waiting on customers who were ready to order, she just sat down and started talking to some people she obviously knew.

Visited several times.Drinks are great. Obviously the signature Irish Coffee is not to be missed.The show preparing it ... depends on the bartender. One of those guys really made it a spectacle to see. Irish Coffee choreography to be sure.Food is very good. Although some dishes might be tweaked.I had the seared tuna salad and boy ... the amount of capers in that salad was really too much. The taste then becomes too tangy. Ease off ... tuna was great.Also had Buena Vista burger. Pretty good too. Maybe a beef patty that's a bit ticker ...Overall though it's an experience and I would certainly visit again.

Best Irish Coffee since Ireland, Worst pour of Guinness ever.

The Irish Coffee was better than what some places tried to serve me while visiting Ireland. It was the best Irish Coffee I've had in the states. So naturally my GF and I decided to order a Guinness. Well I was quite unimpressed and enough so to say that this was the worst pour if Guinness I have received in SF. The service was fast and almost friendly, you could tell that these guys wanted to get you in and back out, quickly turned over. It was great for efficiency though. I didn't really want to hang around, so I was happy. If you plan to hang around this isn't the place to be. The food was great. There were 5 of us 4 vegetarians and a meat eater and we were all very please with the food. A couple of the folks complained that this was $$ not $ as it said on yelp, but I think the prices were reasonable. My recommendation is come get an Irish Coffee maybe a bite to eat and don't expect to hang around for a Guinness.

My husband ordered an Irish coffee at the bar and inquired about ordering food. He was told you had to grab a table - no food at the bar. So when one opened up we sat at it. And sat, and sat, and sat.....No one came to clean it or offer us menus. Two servers, one male, one female, kept looking our way but avoiding us. After nearly 15 minutes I went up to the bar to the woman server (and she was the only woman server on Sunday afternoon on 9/7) and asked for a menu. She rolled her eyes at me and handed a menu over. WOW. Great service. All we wanted was some nachos but apparently no one wanted to serve us. We walked out after another 10 minutes of avoidance and after my husband finished his coffee and we got food next door at the The Pub.

This place has a reputation as being where Irish coffee was created. So, the Irish coffee is fine (if you like it - I don't) but the rest is very limited.

The Buena Vista, near FIsherman's Wharf, is famous as the birthplace of Irish Coffee, and an Irish Coffee at Buena Vista is a San Francisco must. Although primarily a bar (not a sports bar, however), with a pub atmosphere, they not only serve food, but it's very good food. It's not what you would call a romantic spot; it's very noisy, and people share tables. Kids are welcome. As for food, we particularly enjoyed the Dungeness crab melts, with a generous serving of fresh crab on San Francisco sourdough, all accompanied with a nice green salad. Then it was time for the Irish Coffee!

Savory Breakfast with Irish Coffee

My boyfriend has been raving about the Buena Vista cafe for quite awhile that when we got a chance to go again to San Francisco recently, we went there for a late breakfast. I'm glad we did as I finally had some of the world-famous Irish Coffee and am able to say I've been to the Buena Vista. The restaurant itself has a really long bar and adequate seating for both large and small groups. They also had a back area where we were seated that had an additional 4-5 tables. The walls were filled with newspaper articles and pictures related to the cafe's history and goings on. The back area reminded me of a classic steakhouse with dark wood walls and tables. Our server took our orders just a few minutes after we sat down. Of course, we didn't want to pass up on the Irish Whiskey so we ordered two glasses. For our food, we both ordered the Dungeness crab omelette, a healthy sized omelette with fresh crab, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese. I was really "wowed" by the Irish Coffee, which we drank directly without mixing (our server said that it is a layered drink, so best to not mix it. The combination of the heavy cream, coffee and whiskey was perfect, offering a gradual heat inside my body, yet maintaining an enjoyable taste in my mouth. This drink would definitely be good on a cool day! My boyfriend and I decided to split another glass because it was so good! The crab omelette was outstanding, with the eggs made soft enough and not dry and yet firm enough to hold the crab, tomatoes and cheese. I asked for the tomatoes fried and that made the omelette even more enjoyable to eat. This is a place I would definitely come back for the Irish whiskey. If you haven't been to the Buena Vista yet, I highly recommend you go and taste the Irish coffee. It definitely lives up to its hype!

It was later but so what? Didn't try the fabled Irish coffee, seen enough of them in my time.Wouldn't rush back and was slightly disappointed in the experience for somewhere that holds that out as part of the thing.

The Buena Vista Cafe is a must while in San Francisco! It is truly old San Francisco style opening in 1916 and a favorite of the locals. It's not fancy but reasonably priced. I have been to SF many times but had never been to Buena Vista Cafe before. What a treat, they are known for their Irish coffees and they were absolutely the best I have ever had. While there we decided to have an early dinner and the food was very good. The clam chowder was awesome and I had the crab cakes which were delicious! The cafe is on the corner of Hyde near the turn around of the cable cars and across the street from Ghiradelli Square. You have a view of the bay and the cable cars. I would skip the touristy Fisherman's wharf and head straight to the Buena Vista Cafe! I'll definitely be back.

We heard about this place while on a tour bus and decided we just had to try the Irish Coffee. We went there about 9:30am on a week day. It was modestly crowded. The restaurant is small with a bar, a small counter service, and several tables that are offered as shared tables. Food is not served at the bar but we found seating at their counter service. The Irish Coffee is excellent as is the Nutty Irishman coffee. I had the corned beef hash with poached eggs while my wife had sour dough toast with bacon. Both orders were excelllent. The Cafe is a little quirkish with the shared table seating but it appeared to be a local favorite, I think we were the only tourists in the place.

You'd think because of how small it is that you'd have troubles finding a spot. Perhaps because we are lucky we've had great success fitting groups from 6 to 10.

 This place is seriously a must. The Irish coffee is famous (and delicious!!!) But the food is outstanding as well. The service is awesome and the vibe is amazing!

If you are around the Maritime Museum stop in for a snack or a cold one. But you must ALSO have the Irish Coffee. I know "what's so special about Irish Coffee ?" .Stop here and you will find out . The bartenders are pleasant and interesting. Casual setting

Well we didn't go for their Irish Coffee, created here in 1952, but we did have a brunch before setting off to explore SF.It's quite fun and the food was tasty but the service was poor otherwise I would have rated it higher.I suspect that as we were in the side room we were rather forgotten about so my recommendation is to sit in the main room where the bar is.

A great place on Fisherman Wharff

We went in with our teenagers without knowing the place! Now we do, and it is one of the places you would want to return to when possible. Great atmosphere. Good food, we ordered some light dishes, local beer. The place is famous for their Irish Coffee, which we did not know either, which i served in heated glasses just right. Up til now they have served more than 53 million of those, the one we had, was great! Don't bring smaller kids but do visit!

If you are in San Fran you must eat breakfast here!

I cannot come to SF without stopping by this place- it is a SF landmark- they even have Irish Whiskey bottled just for them ! Their Irish coffee is by far the best I have ever had- even beats what they serve in Ireland. Lots of history in this place and they have a darling little gift shop with some nice items just around the corner. Haven't tried the food ( we always sit at the bar ) but it was crowded at 5 p.m. on a Sunday.

Having read the reviews I am sorry that I cannot put a more positive spin on my feedback. It's a buzzing place where it's first come first served for seating. We had the loaded potato skins, jambalaya, shrimp pasta, crab cakes, burger and nothing was more than average at all. Service was ok - not exactly with a smile. Reasonably priced.

We were told about this pub,didn't,t think we would get there.While we were waiting for our food the entertainment was well worth the visit.Irish coffee.The bar man lined up the glasses (after warming them) then began to make Irish coffee by lining all the glasses and pouring in a line each parts of the drink when he finished they all looked perfect and then he took a bow,they tasted good as well.The food was very good also large serves and very reasonable prices.Great tourist attraction.

This restaurant is super cool! It has been there since the late 1800's. the bartenders are super cool. A great gentleman named John was our bartender and he makes one hell of a drink! Totally fun atmosphere! I had the cheesecake one night and it was one of the tastiest cheesecakes I've ever had. We had breakfast there my husband had the steak and eggs two mornings in a row and loved it!! I tired the an omelette one day and the crab cake Benedict the next and wasn't as thrilled with mine. But it was still pretty good!

The Buena Vista Cafe is the American birthplace of Irish Coffee. Legend has it, the coffee was first served here to miners in the gold rush days. But that's legend. It was really invented in 1952, according to the Cafe's web site. It's a wonderful place to have a warm drink on a cool San Francisco day. It's located in Ghirardelli Square, at the base of the Cable Car turnaround. We ate breakfast there. It was pricey, but delicious. And the portions were huge! Basic breakfast meals are $13-$15. Coffee is extra! Table seating is family style. If your party of four is at a table for eight, don't be surprised if other people join you! It's a fun restaurant! Give it a try!

Stopped in with my family after a day of riding cable cars for a quick bite. Hubby had been there before but just for the famous Irish Coffee.The service was great as were all the appetizer items. The Nachos were through the roof! So good, we needed to return a second night to have them again. The place has a great history, great locale, and yes / the Irish coffee isn't too shabby either

Great dinner with the family

A visit to the Buena Vista Cafe during our spring break trip to San Francisco was obligatory, since we had relatives who had visited 20 years prior and had regaled us with stories of the famed Irish Coffee. So, mom, dad, and daughter walked in late one evening after a day filled with sightseeing, and found a cosy table in the back room. Our server was prompt and super friendly, and we quickly settled on food and drinks.My wife ordered the crab cakes from the appetizer menu, a standard order for her in seafood restaurants, so she is very familiar with the dish, and what makes them great. Her verdict on the BV version was two enthusiastic thumbs up. Our daughter stole a bite and also agreed.Our daughter ordered fish and chips for what seemed like the 10th time on our five-day trip, and quickly devoured the lightly-breaded cod and fries. I chose the Cable Car meatloaf and it was delicious--as good as my wife's rendition, with just the right level of spice, and good blend of meat (hamburger and sausage?), and a generous side of garlic mashed potatoes and some veg. Everything on all of our plates was quickly devoured.To top things off, my wife and shared a serving of their amazing bread pudding and an Irish Coffee. The bread pudding was superbly done, and one of the best servings of it I've ever had. I'm not a coffee drinker (I prefer tea), but the Irish Coffee was very good--enough to get me to order the same drink when I was in Dublin on business travel a couple of months later, and then comment that the version from the BV was better. :)

Best irish Coffee ever!

When we lived in the Bay area, we always ended a day in the city at the Buena Vista with an Irish Coffee. While visiting recently, we stopped in at the end of the evening. The Irish Coffee was as good as I remembered! And the show is watching the bartender making multiple cups at the same time.

The Buena Vista located at the end of the cable car line is a great place. Go in, have the Irish Coffee. (they claim it was served there first) It is $10 and a small amount, but very delicious. Stayed for lunch and I had the hot pastrami. Switched to Guinness for lunch and it was....Guinness.... The sandwich was most excellent Others in our group had salads and burgers and they raved about them. Also they had Pilsner on tap and house Chardonnay which they said was very good. We all left happy. The server was pleasant, hard working and efficient.

At the end of a cool, windy San Francisco day, The Buena Vista is a treat! This is the home of Irish Coffee, very popular and worth the stop. Don't be turned off as it's a busy, crowded place but if you want to experience good Irish coffee, great service and just a truly great experience.....GO!

A trip to San Fran isn't complete without several trips to the Buena Vista for some amazing Irish coffees. Unfortunately they continue to raise their price so that a 6oz coffee is now $10. Yes they are incredible but not $10 incredible. So after almost 4 decades, I guess I drank my last ones. Sad. 

Best Breakfast in SF(and Irish Coffees)😜

I had forgotten that I had visited this place, well over a decade ago when I worked for a CA tech company named after a fruit, until our Dylan's four guide pointed it out when we were passing(see my review of Dylan's). I insisted that my wife and sister in law and brother in law accompany me there for breakfast the next day. Tremendous atmosphere, great service, outstanding food and the Irish coffees are world class(I'm a beer guy). It has been there for well over 100 years, and deservedly so. There'll be a wait, but oh so worth it. A must "to do" in San Fran!

Had Sunday morning breakfast here while walking around Fisherman's Wharf. It opens early, the food was delicious and service was good and fast. I wish I would have known that part of Buena Vista's "charm" is that people sit wherever there is an empty seat. My husband and I were sitting at a table for four when two people pulled up the chairs and joined us. I was surprised (and frankly a little annoyed) by this until the person joining us admonished me that it was how it was done at Buena Vista. They were delightful people and we enjoyed sharing breakfast with them.

We ate here twice - both times brunch/lunch time and it was packed to the rafters. You often have to share a table with strangers but that's fine. The food is nice - both times we ate it was good food, a little old-fashioned in keeping with the setting. The staff are also, and this is a compliment, a little old-fashioned in keeping with the setting. They're friendly, long-serving (the barman's been here 50 years - our waitress was a "newbie" at only being there 15!) and not remotely corporate or artificial. Just a warm welcome in a bustling bar and restaurant with good food and tons of character. We went twice and neither time did we sample the famous Irish Coffee - however, it was hilarious to see how many pillars of the community were knocking back the Irish Coffees at 11am!

The food and vibe is San Francisco's own. Brunch is my favorite time to dine at the Cafe. Bloody Maty's and Mimosas... OMG. The Irish Coffee is the BEST. Food options are plentiful and delicious.The wait staff are very interesting and fun people. The Cafe is a busy place, so don't plan to spend the morning at a table. You can always take your party across the street to the park area and get in line for the Cable car ride.
