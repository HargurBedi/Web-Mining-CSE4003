Located in the Inner Richmond District on Clement Street, the Burma Superstar is a small neighborhood restaurant with a delicious, unique menu. Because there is limited seating with maybe 14 tables, wait times can be considerable. Arrive early before noon for lunch on a weekday and occasionally you'll be seated immediately as I was on a Monday. The tea leaf salad is memorable and a must. Service is friendly and the atmosphere relaxed. If you are a single diner, a large oval table that seats 6-8 is often your best option and you get to chat with many locals. I lived in the Richmond district for 20+ years when Clement Street transitioned to have 70+ Asian restaurants on the ten block stretch from Arguello to 11th Avenue and Burma Superstar is among the best and most unique in the area.There is a bench and tea service for those waiting for a table.

I always look forward to visiting Burma Superstar on Clement street in San Francisco. The food is great once you get a table and therein lies the challenge! Parking is next to impossible and average wait time once you register your name at the restaurant can be anywhere from 30-60 minutes! But these challenges are worth the tasty food! The Tea leaf salad is a must! There are several ingredients which are mixed together by the server. The taste is quite unique. The fiery vegetables or seafood are also very good. Well worth a visit.

We recently had lunch at Burma Superstar with family who live in San Francisco and who'd been many times before and wanted to take us. We arrived early (as you must) and were fortunate enough to get in, in the first sitting and didn't have to wait in the street long before opening. We hadn't tried Burmese food before and found it absolutely tasty and flavoursome. Like others, the tea leaf salad is a must. Very good service too.

Atmosphere is really unusual and inviting. Service is very good unless it's one of those overcrowded times with people crowding the street to get in, then it's spotty. The food is very good, unique, and consistent. Most everything is shareable and family style. Noise level can be pretty high depending on the crowd. It's a trendy neighborhood place. No reservations unless you are 6 or more. Difficult parking. The food a block or so away at B-Star is tastier. But not the same atmosphere. More open and airy.

As a resident in the neighborhood, I can't resist popping in to Burma Superstar when I see that there is no line. Typically, there is a crowd waiting to get into the restaurant during lunch hour. Luckily for me and my family, we arrived for a late lunch and were able to walk right in. All the food we ordered was delicious, fresh and presented well. We were able to snag a big table with a Lazy Susan rotating panel which the toddlers in our group thought was astonishing. It also made it easy to serve everyone. The food is sometimes spicy and always complex and it appealed to the toddlers in our group as well as the parents and grandparents. Service is always pleasant and professional. Worth a visit whether you are a tourist or a San Francisco resident.

I used this restaurant for take away while staying at an Airbnb in San Francisco. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, pumpkin pork stew, egg plant with garlic sauce and brown rice. The food was piping hot when I collected it and well packed for the cab ride home. The dishes were perfectly cooked each with their own distinct flavours. Portion size was large as it typical with most meals in the US. We had plenty for our evening meal and lunch the following day. All at a reasonable price. Will definitely be visiting again next time I'm in town.

We were anxiously anticipating trying out the food at Burma Superstar. We ordered take-out on our last night in San Francisco and the best word to describe the food is "meh". The platha and dip was very similar to roti canai, but I would rather have the roti canai. The Spicy and Crispy chicken should just be named General Tso's because that is exactly what it is. The standout items were ordered were the Fiery Chicken and the Tea Leaf salad.

Yum, yum, yum and yummy. We came all the way from Australia and tried the authentic taste of Burmese food. Nearly as good as my mother in laws cooking. Curry was sensational. Soup was awesome. Great service, we got there just before midday and just beat the rush. There is a long queue after 12pm. We took a local bus from Union Square bus number 2 and dropped us across the road from the restaurant. Approx half hour bus ride. We will go back.

There is really not much more that can be said about this remarkable place! Want to try a taste explosion? Look no further than Burma Superstar. Yes you will have to wait for a table - but that is part of the fun. Go walk around the very interesting neighborhood - buy some tea, fresh fruit, or stop at a bakery. As for Burma - everything on the menu is incredible. Start with the tea leaf or rainbow salad (both are amazing). My favorite dishes are the shrimp kebat, the garlic/chili shrimp, minted chicken, garlic noodles and coconut rice. But literally anything you select will be good. Don't forget a Thai iced tea.....killer.

Visited on a Sunday midday and were able to get a table fairly quickly.

The coconut tofu was so delicious, we started with 2 servings (for 4 adults and a toddler) but added a third as we all wanted more.All in all this meal was amazing and the staff was extremely kind. If I lived in Oakland, I'd go back on a weekly basis!

My parents had the tea leaf salad, which was reported to also be scrumptious and delicious. It was even featured on food network! I am so glad I had the fortune to be here. I hope they have gluten free foods, so I can enjoy them again one day.

We made a last minute decision to try this restaurant. We went for a late lunch (around 2pm) and still waited about 15-20 minutes for a table. It was well worth the wait and we would definitely wait again. The tea leaf salad is awesome! I had the sesame chicken and my husband had the stew. Both were amazingly delicious. The coconut rice was also very tasty! If you like ginger and lemonade, get their ginger lemonade. It's very gingery and refreshing.

Went to Burma Superstar on a chilly August evening with my husband. We've both traveled a fair amount in SE Asia, but had never tried Burmese food. Such a great blend of flavors! Service was good. We called to get on list for table before we left our downtown hotel, so ended up waiting 30 minutes. Totally worth it!!! They have a sister restaurant around the corner; if you don't want to wait, ask the hostess about it.A highlight of our SF visit!

Delicious Burmese food -- a nice change from Chinese and Thai

Burmese food is not terribly common, and is absolutely delicious. The cuisine borrows flavors from Chinese, Indian and Thai cuisine in a way that creates its own unique flavors. Burma Superstar is a fun, lively, small spot that serves up traditional Burmese dishes. I'm partial in particular to the samosas (what is it they put in that addictive dipping sauce?!) and the Chili Lamb (do NOT ask for extra spicy...it's plenty spicy already, and I love all things hot and spicy). They do not take reservations, but a little known trick is to call ahead and they will put your name on the waiting list.

I'm always really weary about resturants that have some much hype. I've visited so many that make me question if people even have taste buds, but this was NOT one of those times. We arrived a little after 7pm on a Saturday night and were told it was going to be atleast an hour and a half wait. We drove about an hour to get there so we decided to wait. We were able to put our name in and phone number to receive a text when our table was ready which meant we could go venture for some adult beverages. On a side not bitter ends has an amazing bartender and really fair drink prices if you find yourself waiting for a table for as long as we did :). We shared the platha and dip (where has coconut chicken curry been my entire life?) And the Samusas, which I didn't care for but my wife ate scraped the plate. We then split the sweet and spicy crispy chicken and coconut rice. There wasn't really anything spicy about it more sweet, but the flavors of everything were incredible. Cons: restaurant is tiny, like tiny, tiny. We got to know our neighbors on both sides though which was nice. ALSO Prepare to wait, but you won't regret it!!

Our family of 4 stopped here on our way to Legion of Honor to see the Degas exhibit. My DH had been here a few months back and raved about it. He said we had to have the fermented tea leaf salad. The description for this salad is fermented tea leaves, that right there stopped me cold. But the DH said to get it. So we did, that and the Rainbow salad with 21 ingredients. The server came with dishes and offered to serve them to us. He started by squeezing a half of a lemon on top and then proceeded to toss all the ingredients. OH MY! It was so wonderful! The tastes were many, the textures were many, it was unbelievably umami-licious! The rainbow salad was equally as good, As were all the other dishes we had! It is going to live in my memory for a long long time! So go, Take a chance if it is not something you would normally try! Take your friends from out of town! But take them! There is also a cookbook!!! We were told a 15 minute wait but it was so much less than! Tables are rather close together. but the sound is not so loud as you can't hear your tablemates. Service was great! Staff patiently answered our questions about everything after we ate. They to import the fermented tea leaves from Myanmar! Our waiter had actually been there and seen the process! Portions are large and intended for sharing. We also ordered the Mint Chicken which was fiery, I did not try it cause I was told I would not enjoy the heat. But 2 of our party said it was fantastic. Also ordered Wok Tossed Broccoli and dried fried String beans! Both were such a pleasure to eat, I am sure I would eat broccoli and green beens every day if I could prepare them like this! We can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!! GO! They do an odd thing here is SF where they close from 3 to 5! Be forewarned!We looked at the dessert menu but we were really too stuffed to indulge! Maybe next time!

Tea Leaf Salad. That's it. That's all you need to get. It is a salad that will transport your taste buds do the happy dance. It is that good but then again..everything on the menu looked good and they have lots of locals and regulars that frequent the restaurant. Don't let the wait deter you as the line moves fairly quickly since people tend to leave the line because of the wait so that bumps you ahead. We went around 2 one afternoon and there was no problem getting a table for 2. The service is also great. The ladies that work there are really nice and will make excellent recommendations for newbies.

Three of us=$100 with tip. Only one drink- a mango lassi 8oz at $4..75 and it was good. Rainbow salad not that super. Samosa soup good. Chicken mushroom entree not good- textures too chewy, so avoid. Other entrees were fried tofu and tofu with green beans - both ok. Jasmine rice with few pieces shredded coconut nothing to rave about. Get there by 6p or wait outside. Overrated. Find something cheaper on clement street.

Burma Superstar on Clement street in San Francisco is undoubtedly one of the best places to dine in San Francisco. The quality has remained consistent over time as have the crowds lining up outside. Wait time at 7 PM on a Wednesday was around 30 minutes. Unfortunately they do not take reservations. They have installed over-head heaters for folks waiting outside which really helps as it can get windy and cold standing outside. Parking is a hassle during dinner hours but try one of the side streets being aware of NOT parking in someone's driveway.Once we got in, we found the place was packed and loud!. It is a small place with maybe 15-20 tables placed close to one another. Everyone seemed to be happy and yes, Loud! We ordered their famous Tea Leaf salad along with chilled Singha beers and Pepper Chicken as appetizer. Both tasted really good. For the main course we ordered the Mango Chicken and Fiery Vegetables. They were all delicious.I would highly recommend this place.

None of us 6 had ever really eaten Burmese food before. I booked this restaurant with high hopes and it didn't disappoint. The wine list was extensive. The service was wonderfully knowledgeable and attentive. The place was crowded and bustling with energy. We ordered the rainbow salad and tea leaf salad, both of which were refreshing, tasty and complex in flavour. We ordered the pork curry with mangoes, chicken biryani, prawn curry, mixed vegetables and mango dessert. A very memorable experience and hopefully we can explore Burmese food more! But you gotta gamble...they don't accept reservations and you really gotta be lucky to get in on a weekend!

I have to admit I was the "grumpy guy" after waiting three times the amount of time that they told us. I don't ever like to start a review with a negative but let me just tell you that you should expect to wait and don't get hangry like I did. If just go in with the expectation you will have to be patient and know that you'll be blown away by the amazing food. The dishes were sized to share and we went family style and loved it. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors explode in your mouth. I was absolutely amazed at how inexpensive the dishes are considering we are in San Francisco and everything is expensive. I will come back and I will come back often. Take out looks like a great option too and as soon as I can I will be ordering so I can take it home and enjoy from the comfort of my own place. You will not regret checking this place out!

A friend from home said this is her favorite restaurant on the planet, and I can see why. We did try the Tea Leaf Salad and Ginger Salads, both were outstanding. The chicken noodle soup was everyone's favorite, though. Beef tips and rice were also spot on. My picky 10 year old son loved the Walnut Shrimp. Vegetable Samosas were a delicious starter and we had a mango cooler type of alcoholic drink with mint that was divine. Kids loved the Thai iced tea! We did arrive about 4:45 p.m., and joined the line waiting for the 5:00 opening-we were fortunate to make the first seating! Excellent, friendly, and efficient service round out this visit.

We visited this restaurant on recommendation from a friend and arrived at around 8pm on a Wednesday night. The place was packed and there was a wait, however we were told we could be seated immediately if we were happy to sit on a communal table. We had no problem with this and were happy with the setup of the communal table.The wait staff were attentive, friendly, and made great recommendations based on what we told them we liked. They also recommended AGAINST a dish we requested because it was too similar to something else we had ordered which we appreciated. ALL dishes were perfect, Tasty, fresh and generous in portion size! We will definitely be back if we visit SF again.

Best food and atmosphere of our 2 week California trip.

I reluctantly agreed to go to Burma Superstar, due to its distance from our hotel and it being the last night of our two week trek through coastal California. Once there, the food, staff service and atmosphere were so superb. The best by far during a trip where we hit some many good spots. Clearly a hidden jewel in the San Francisco culinary scene.

Burma Superstar really is a superstar in San Francisco. I wasn't sure what the hype was about and would never normally choose something called tea leaf salad but I was assured it was the best thing by people who knew what they were talking about. The waitress explained each of the ingredients and then mixed the salad in front of us. It really has a distinctive flavor and as a non tea drinker I was pleasantly surprised. The coconut ice cream dish was the perfect dessert to finish the meal off.I have since tried finding Tea Leaf salad in California and the only answer comes up Burma Superstar SF. We went at lunchtime and there was no line, it filled up fairly quickly and I've heard there can be a line at other times.

New flavors and dishes , nothing compares...

I heard it was popular. My sister who lives nearby said lets do early lunch and we'll probably get in. The three of us were seated immediately and within a half hour the entire place was packed.The standout was the Tea Leaf Salad. Tossed at table the final mix is full of new and yet familiar flavors.The chicken basil was excellent if predictable but yet is had something not tasted before. The corker was the rose tea that was so fragrant it could have been a room spray. The bottom of the little porcelain pot had actual tiny rose hips so you can't get more authentic than that. Overall a memorable experience and the help was great!

Overrated-nothing special

I'm not really sure what all the hype is about. It's a good place, but it's not anything special. It definitely does not warrant waiting in a long line to get inside.Yes the food is good, but there are hundreds of good restaurants in San Francisco. Everyone is very friendly and service is quick as they want to turn the tables as quickly as possible.Don't sit under the fan that has a light above it. It will give you a headache if not a seizure. 

The hype is real!

Went to SF for the first time and tried to do some research on where to eat. This place kept showing up. I was a little nervous that it wouldn't live up to the hype...but it did!! Started with the sticky fingers...best Asian style ribs I've ever had. Then tried the tea leaf salad...amazing flavors. The service was also spot on. Go early!

Good food in pleasant surroundings

It's been many years since I was in this restaurant. The decor is lovely with well coordinated items and a big photo mural of Rangoon (Yangon) looking towards the River.About ten years ago, I started visiting Yangon frequently for work and so I was able to point out places of interest to my lunch companion.We went tapas style ordering everything from the Appetiser menu for lunch:vegetarian lettuce cups, lamb samosas, fried yellow bean tofu and pork riblets. Everything was very good and tasty but perhaps not with most authentic Burmese taste. That could be an acquired palate. We finished with the black rice dessert, a Southeast Asian favorite.We were the last guests to leave during lunchtime. And we saw the staff bringing food in large basins and bowls for the staff lunch. Cheekily, I went over to ask if I could have this buffet as this food looked very authentic. They invited us to have a taste.The balakyau was certainly authentic. My companion liked this and some of the other dishes a lot!Perhaps the management could offer more of this authentic Burmese cuisine to their existing menu?The cooks are from Burma, though perhaps of Chinese descent. They can cook for the "fusion" taste as well as with Burmese authentic flavors.

LOVE!!

We were visiting from NYC and my oldest friend suggested for us to have dinner here, but we were hesitant when she told us there could be a two hour wait. Two hour wait for Asian food?! Long story short, we decided to go and only had a 15 minute wait. Burma Superstar is so good we went back the next night! Being half Japanese, lived and traveled all over Asia, living in NYC - this restaurant is one of the best around. Please bring Burma Superstar to NYC! And can't forget, big shout out to Alex who was so great!

Ok I know this place real well, I eat there once a month with my son, we have been going there for maybe 6 or 7 years.Never disappointed.First time you eat the tea leaf salad you discover a new world, this is so amazing.Service is impeccable, it is always a joy. Burmese food is close to Thai food but has its own unique flavors.

Amazing.

This restaurant is amazing. We got there right when it opened and easily got a seat although there was a line at the door. Tea leaf salad is excellent and coconut rice!! I had a mangoSmoothie that was also amazing. Can't wait to go back someday

I have one vegetarian in the family so finding restaurants with a diverse menu is important. Burma Superstar lived up to the previous reviews and everyone in the family found something to like. Beware of the wait...we got there at 4:50 on a Sunday...10 minutes before opening...and there was a line already formed of about 15 tables ahead of us. I will say...they sat all the tables right away and our food truly did not take all that long to serve. Amazing!

We found this in trip advisor because of the great reviews. We weren't let down, the food was great and the staff was very friendly. If your in San Francisco this should be one place you need to visit for dinner

Burma Superstar has been featured on Food Network. After eating my meal, I'm not surprised. I showed up about 15 minutes before they opened on a Sunday night, and the line was already 20 people deep!I tried the following dishes:Samusa Soup - Delicous! If you've ever eaten Cincinnati chili, the flavor tasted very similar. I ate almost half of the large bowl. Sticky Fingers - They live up to their name! Sweet meets savory goodness in these pork ribs. Coconut Rice - The perfect companion to the ribs. Light, fresh, and sticky.

Unassuming, this place has incredible food. You are in for an explosion of flavors with every single dish. Start with the green tea leaf salad, it big enough to share. The house specialties are delicious try the lamb curry"wow". 

Visit, revisit and repeat

The fragrance of the sauces, the quality of the food and the finesse of the use of chilis make this a remarkable find for Asian food aficionados. Not very expensive and definitely out of the way, I was raving about the food for several days. As their menu indicates, Burma sits at the intersection of great cuisines like Indian, Thai and Chinese. Even if you do not like spicy food, ask the server for help and keep tasting.Rare to find such quality across the whole menu at an affordable price - even the coconut race had real flavor.

Burma Superstar is the BEST in SF

Everytime I visit San Francisco I always make it a point to eat at BURMA SUPERSTAR. It helps that my friends don't live to far, so we usually just walk from their place near 6th and California. The restaurant itself is quaint and only has around 12 tables in total. If you go right when they open, chances are you won't have to wait very long, if at all. Most other peak times you can expect to wait at least 20-30 minutes. Graciously, the restaurant offers complimentary tea which helps to keep warm while waiting in the SF fog. Everything I've tried here is exceptional, however, I highly recommend the lychee mimosa (pitcher!), samusas, tea leaf salad (prepared with flair table side), and the sesame chicken. YUM! The service is always exceptional, and even with a packed house, the food service is timely and well-paced. I absolutely love this place and it is always on my SF To-Do list. In fact, I'll be dining there this week - probably on Friday for lunch to avoid some of the heavier crowds. P.S. B-Star is Burma's sister restaurant and is a couple more blocks down Clement St. They have some of the Burma staples, and other items - almost always less busy than it's more well-known sibling restaurant.

Delicious!

The food (simusa and fiery tofu) was excellent, and the tea was even better! The service was also very good. Not much more to say.

Stopped here for lunch while sightseeing in SF. First thing is to get there early. There was a pretty long line, but we managed to get a big table for our group. The food was excellent, portions were pretty big and the service was outstanding. We ordered several different appetizers and entrees and everything was gone when we were finished. Even the little kids got plenty. Highly recommend.

One of the most delicious meals I ever ate. I ordered a dish with ramen noodles, cooked green leaves, chopped nuts, tofu, and it was completely delicious. The ginger lemon iced tea was scrumptious. Service was fast and they were crowded. Loved, loved, loved this place. Reasonable prices too. Highly recommended.

Wow!! You were correct! Awesome!

A delicious find at the most reasonable prices found for high quality and incredible taste!! Must try the fun drinks Burma Cooler and herbal tea. Then kick things up with the Tea Leaf Salad and Platha and Dip. And, for the entrees try the Nan Pia Doc and Garlic Chili Shrimp! Enjoy!

Plan on waiting. They don't take reservations. They will text you when they're ready to seat you. We went across the street and down a bit to the Irish pub while we waited. The food is so worth the wait for seating! Service is good. We had the Vegetarian Samusa soup, eggplant and tofu curry and the Fiery Vegetables with Tofu. All were out of this world delicicous. We brought three friends who were timid to try Burmese food but they all loved it! Will definitely come back next time I'm in the Bay area.

Southeast Asia - San Francisco Style at Burma Superstar

Date: January 9, 2017
On a chilly San Francisco winter day, there was no better place to eat lunch than at cozy, warm and welcoming Burma Superstar. We had to wait about ten minutes, but the carafes of hot, self-serve tea outside the door kept us plenty warm. So hard to choose our lunch due to the inviting looking dishes on the menu! While waiting for our choices, I enjoyed looking at the lovely, interesting decor, including giant woks that served as overhead lanterns. And when the food started to arrive it looked delicious, smelled delicious, and was totally satisfying to palates that had been seeking some truly south-asian flavors! Don't be dismayed if there's a line when you get there - it tends to move fast. After you eat here, you'll probably start planning when you can come back!

Ate here early afternoon. After a few minutes wait outside we were shown to our table. The tables are very close to each other. I did feel like I was having lunch with people on the adjacent tables! The food was very tasty. Plenty to eat and reasonably priced. Service was good. Would recommend.

Good - Yes. But not in the 'Best' category

Liked everything here - the waiting time to enter, the warmth of the service and the explanation of the ordered foods. The tea leaf salad was very good - crunchy with peanuts and other nuts and the green 'chutney' used to mix it. The samusas' were pretty average in terms of size and filling. In my opinion the Indian version of samusas' are way better. The main course of chicken and shrimp casserole was good but not outstanding.

Never disappointed!

This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. When I visited this place one year ago I was cautious. Honestly this restaurant is highly recommended!
