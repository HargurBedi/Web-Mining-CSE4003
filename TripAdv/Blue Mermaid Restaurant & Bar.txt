We had dinner at the Blue Mermaid the other day. The first impression is somewhat of a dive bar. Once you sit down you realize it is a legit restaurant. The food was very good. The Manhattan Clam Chowder was to drawer, as was the hamburger. The cioppino got,high marks for a lover of that dish, as did the seafood pasta. The only flaw was the need to flag down the waiters in order to order something. Maybe someone was out sick that night.

Ate here because of the room credit from staying at the Argonaut Hotel. Only did breakfast. The menu is very good for a breakfast menu and we enjoyed different items each day. The food was well prepared and tasty. The service was different each day, and tended to be on the slow side. But overall, if you're staying at the Argonaut, use your room credit here with no worries.

I've been here before they renovated and the updated ambiance is nice with the booths that can seat 6 (if you squeeze in). They kept their outdoor seating for when you have nice days out you can really enjoy the weather. We were there in the late morning and since it was Fleet Week, didn't think we would be able to get a table but it wasn't busy so we had our booth seating. McLaren was our server and she was extremely informative of what was available. My companion needs GF (not by choice) and our server understood and provided us with all the options available, she had the Manhattan Chowder and it was delish. I had the Challah French Toast with Berry Butter. The toast was a thick slice stuffed with loads of raisins and the egg batter was light which made this an absolute treat for me. The Berry Butter was so tasty that I didn't need the syrup at all. It was a great meal couple with a great server. It got busier as we sat but she still made time to check up on us. What a great restaurant, would definitely be a favorite stop for us.

Stayed at the Argonaut Hotel and had drinks down here one evening. Bar is terrific in the outside eating area is second to none on a chilly evening. Heaters provide more than enough adequate heat to enjoy the evening. Nice wine list and decent selection of tap beers. Nothing special but above average for a hotel bar

Stopped in on my last night in San Francisco. It was a bit chilly so sat outside by one of the fire pits which was perfect. The fish and chips and crab chowder were so good. There was a guitarist playing across the street and he was really good so that added to make it a nice ambiance.

We decided to try this restaurant next to our hotel after a long day of walking around San Francisco. It took a while to be seated as there was no one at the hostess station (and never was the entire evening). It was incredibly dark in the restaurant. I even had to use a flash to photograph the food. I chose the crab and corn chowder in a bread bowl and dungeness crab cakes. There was a lot more bread than chowder, which was a bit on the thin side. The crab cakes were okay. Service was really slow. I wish we would have tried another restaurant since there were so many in the area.

Was staying in the hotel attached to this restaurant so we ate here a couple times during our stay. The breakfast is phenomenal - great food, fast service.The lunch left a lot to be desired. Our service was slow, our food was bland, and with the prices where they are, we definitely expected more. Great place to grab breakfast or brunch, but choose one of the other restaurants in the area if you're wanting lunch or dinner.

Staying at the Argonaut Hotel, which is beautiful! Thought we'd stop in for a little snack and cocktail after walking around San Francisco all day. The service was terrible. We could not have been more of an inconvenience to our server. She rushed us into getting drinks, and rushed us to decide on our food. Another server dropped off our food, refilled our waters, and asked us how everything was. She did not even come to ask us how our food was. We had to ask for the check.... the food was tasty, and they had a great cocktail selection. However, if you're looking to be acknowledged during your dining experiences, go elsewhere.

We had several different libations over our multiday stay and the mixologists got them right every time. This type of unfailing professionalism seems rare these days and it was greatly appreciated.The restaurant was more of a mixed bag with some items being particularly good while others were merely OK. The crab and corn was my favorite over the clam chowder. The crab Louie was just OK according to my wife and the fish and chips were merely OK as well. Our friends liked their salmon and trout.

With so many restaurants to choose from head here for one of the best!

We had the clam chowder here and it was very good. Well balanced and not too salty as sometimes it can get at other places. This is connected to hotel Argonaut so if you feel overwhelmed finding a good clam chowder (which is everywhere around this area), this is one that you can dive into right away.

I've walked by this place a few times and liked the outdoor area and I could see that they served breakfast and brunch. My husband and I decided to play tourist on Labor Day and headed over to the City. We decided to try something we haven't before, so we went to the Blue Mermaid. Disappointed. The menu looked good, but food was less than average. When we arrived the person seating people asked our waitress if he could seat us and she said loudly, "you can seat them but I can't get to them for a while." Okay, understandable and we weren't in a hurry. I actually felt sorry for the waitress. She seemed to be the only one waiting on tables outside and there were quite a few people. She was hustling, taking orders and clearing tables, while I just watched a guy stand in the doorway doing nothing. When the food came, it was only okay. I had the Crab Benedict. There were so many shells in the crab that I finally just scrapped it all of the bread and put it to the side. The crab did not seem fresh as it was very strong "overly" fishy taste. My husband and the Huevos Rancheros and the fried the tortilla hard and brittle, and maybe some people eat it that way, but we have never seen it that way before. He said it was "okay." I probably should give this place a lower score, but the waitress was working her butt off, so I will stick with a 3. The food was a 2.

We were staying at the Argonaut hotel so decided to use the Blue Mermaid as it was on site.

Ate breakfast here most mornings on a recent visit to SF. The kitchen is consistent, producing nicely seasoned, good quality dishes in a timely fashion. I really enjoyed the avocado toast most of all. My only qualm was the quality of the coffee which seemed to be all over the map - good one day, bad the next. Still, with SF's cold summer mornings, it was nice not to have to leave the hotel for breakfast.

Visited on a chilly, foggy day and decided nothing fit the day better than Clam Chowder. Definitely the best I've had. Too often (usually) the chowder is thickened with either flour or corn starch.

We ate here this morning. Let me start by saying the service is ok, but slowAnd there were only about 8 tables in this large restaurant. It's cute with good atmosphere. Coffee is good and theyHave a good Bloody Mary. My husband had avocado toast which was ok...nothing exciting. And we shared a pancake which was very good. But I would not recommend the Oscar Benedict. The entire dish from the potatoes,to the eggs, to the hollandaise was COLD. My husband put his finger in the hollandaise and was shocked how cool it was. The English muffin was not toasted and mushy. I Made them Heat it up in the microwave. Still Gross. The restAurant claims the dish is meant to be served cool. Yuk. They should put comment on the menu if that is true. At $80 for breakfast not including tip? I expect better. Unfortunately I think it's touristy and they don't seem toHave to Try very hard because they will always have business. For my money? I would not go back.

Historic bar in the Argonaut hotel

The Argonaut is at the end of Pier 39 around the block from Ghirardelli. Blue Mermaid extends out the hotel lobby, and is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Pier 39 and seek a little privacy. At night, gather around the fire hearth and warm up from the cold San Francisco nights. The Argonaut hotel is a national historic site and used to be the Dole Cannery building. Exposed brick, timber wood, and nautical artifacts abound at the Blue Mermaid. Start or end your adventure here, but it's not your final destination. There is a patio next door with lively music, and down the street lights up at night towards Ghirardelli.

I stayed at the Argonaut Hotel and had a few meals at this restaurant. I had room service breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast, and fruit cup. The order arrived within 15 minutes to my room and was delicious. Hot, very nicely presented, and the delivery person was very polite and friendly. I was in San Francisco for my daughter's wedding. After the wedding and reception, I got back to my hotel and was quite tired. I stopped in and asked for a cup of tea. The waiter, Frank, was so nice to me, seeing that I was tired and immediately bought me a nice pot of tea with honey. The staff did not mind I wasn't ordering any food.The next day I went out to enjoy the town. When I returned, I was a little hungry and brunch was still being served. I had French Toast that was delicious!! It is served with mixed Berry Butter, which is different and innovative , but I must be careful about eating tiny seeds, so I asked to switch to regular butter. There was no problem at all with my request. I enjoyed the brunch very much. The waiter was very nice and friendly.Then, I tried having dinner one night and was seated in the far back corner. It was in an empty, secluded section of the restaurant. No one came after about ten minutes of my sitting there, even though the restaurant wasn't overly busy. I looked over the menu and didn't see anything that actually appealed to me, so I quietly left. I think on another night, I would try it again as it seems to be a very good restaurant with a sweet ambience. There is seating outside, with fire pits. I think I'd like that. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Not sure why the dinner time was so different from my other experiences. Please try the Blue Mermaid as I'm sure you'll enjoy it, especially if you are with someone. Unfortunately quiet and reserved solo diners often get ignored in restaurants , which is too bad.

I spent a week at the Argonaut Hotel recently and visited a lot of restaurants in the Fisherman's Wharf area. My wife and I agree that the Blue Mermaid was at the too of the list there. The pricing is Fisherman's Wharf average and they have an excellent outdoor restaurant atmosphere in the evenings with the fireplaces and heaters to fend off the cool breezes. From burgers to seafood to cheese plates and Ahi Tacos, we like the place.

We were excited to try Blue Mermaid as we had read prior to our trip the menu had recently changed and a renovation had recently taken place. This restaurant is situated in the Argonaut Hotel. We found the menu to be VERY limited. The food was not very good. Our waitress would rather have been doing anything besides being our waitress. So, poor service and marginal food led to a not-so-good experience.

We were staying at the Argonaut Hotel and decided on dinner there one night. I had the cioppino and it was completely amazing! As in really really fantasic! That's the plus. The cons were our server at the table was pretty much non-existant, I had to go to the bar to get our waters refilled, and when I told him that we had a tab at the bar we needed to take care of he got really fiesty with me and told me that the bartender said I had paid. I had one drink, I remember i didn't pay. But his attitude about it kind of ruined the whole free drink thing. Also, the cioppino is served with garlic toast. The bread was burnt to a crisp and not edible. I would've loved to dunk bread in the sauce, but since our waiter was MIA, I couldn't ask for any non-burnt bread. Great cioppino, but eh on everything else.

Stopped in here around 7:30 on a Sunday night and the place was only about one-third full. The hostess said there was going to be about a 40 minute wait for the six of us. We thought that was odd since the place was so dead. I guess their staffing was down as we really did have to wait for a while. All we wanted was their corn clam chowder, we eventually talked the manager into having us waited on in a more timely manner. The corn clam chowder was excellent, I had mine in a bread bowl which was also very good. I would have rated this place a 5-star but the lack of service and customer appreciation lowered my score to only 4 stars. Anyways, at least their corn clam chowder was very good.

We ended up eating at our hotel's restaurant due to it being 4th of July and there was an hour wait everywhere else. We should have known better. We got to the hotel, which had plenty of open tables and wasn't that busy, and they told us we had to wait for 20 minutes. We're in the hospitality business, so we understand fake waits to allow time for your kitchen to catch up. So we checked backed after 16 minutes, they said "no you still have 4 minutes left." Which is not the way to run a fake wait. Once we did get seated, and after waiting a few minutes for the server, I got the crab and corn chowder and Brussel Sprouts. Both were delicious. My husband got the fish and chips which was good but fries were ice cold. They were very good about taking it off the check though. My daughter got the kids grilled cheese which was only decent and my son got the burger which was also only decent. All in all I think we would have been better off waiting for an hour to get some in and out burger.

This is a must have for dining on the wharf. No it is not Alioto's or Fisherman's Grotto but it is superb. Their corn clam chowder is stellar and you are a safe bet on any of the menu items, steel cut oats for the health conscious, the grilled chicken club or Blue Mermaid Burger are just outstanding.We normally hit is for brunch to avoiding having to wait. Seating out doors is always a treat windy/cold or not. Be sure to go to the restrooms so as to "tour" the restaurant. Its nautical theme is so keen.As a disabled veteran, I asked if they gave a discount and was pleasantly surprised that they do and a healthy one at that. If you are a vet be sure to ask, be able to prove.

Both meals were good and the only thing that put me off was another couple who brought their dog to the restaurant. Maybe this is a done thing in San Francisco but I personally don't want a dog looking at me while I'm having my lunch

There is a reason this place had open reservations on a Saturday night. My mom and I came here for dinner, mostly because most other places were booked. The crab dip definitely pass on. The clam chowder bread bowl, initially I was skeptical as it was not as think as I expected, the flavor was good and it was the saving grace of the meal. Fish and chips were the main course and lacked flavor. The fries arrived cold but they replaced them immediately. All and all choose another place to eat.

We ate at Blue Mermaid for breakfast Sunday morning and it was less than average. We had to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table and were seated in a section where our server was noticeably overwhelmed. He was nice but we went without service several times (no water refills, no coffee refills, we had to wait until he was around just to ask for some pepper as we only had a salt shaker on the table). The food was good but not worth the poor service. I had a Bloody Mermaid (this restaurant's version of a Bloody Mary). It was good but very spicy and I could not finish it because I could not get a refill on water to help wash it down and cool off my mouth. Disappointing despite being in the beautiful Argonaut Hotel.

My husband and I stopped in for a quick drink and a bowl of chowder after visiting the national park visitor center next door. The crab chowder was the best I've tasted, anywhere, and of course we had to have it in a sourdough bread bowl. The bartender was so sweet and gave us many pointers, as it was our first time in San Francisco. If you're walking along the wharf, it is definitely worth your time to stop in for a snack, if not dinner. Since we didn't order an actual meal, I cannot give advice on that, but if the food is anywhere near as good as the chowder, you won't be sorry. Also, there are many fun drinks to try, if you just want a drink. 

Great

Yes, the menu is limited. Yes, it's an hotel restaurant. Yes, it's on the Fisherman's Wharf, so it smells like a trap for tourists. Yes, the interior old-mariner design is awful. But forget all this and stop here, this is a solid good restaurant. Try the garlic roasted dungeness crab, or the chowder. You will not regret it. Recommended

Great drinks and dinner attached to a trendy hotel that we stayed in. We were able to walk right in and grab a great outdoor seat on our way out but ended up staying for more drinks and a good dinner at the Blue Mermaid. They have some award winning seafood chowder!

While staying at the Argonaut Hotel, we ate breakfast at this restaurant off the lobby of the hotel. The omelets and coffee were great and the portions were generous. Service was professional and very courteous.

I've eaten here several times over the years and always enjoyed it, despite it being in the heart of the touristy Fishermen's Wharf area. When I ate there in March 2017 with a friend who was also a fan, the menu had been greatly pared down and some of the old familiar offerings were missing. The crab cakes (which my friend ordered) used to come with smashed garlic potatoes (I'm fairly sure of that) and they are now just crab cakes with a minimal polenta-like corn mush. I got a sandwich which was just average. What was not average were the prices. While the number of menu items decreased, the prices all increased. The restaurant was practically empty when we were there on a weeknight, yet the service was poor and the waiter vanished several times. The bar was fairly crowded. At one point, the waiter did say they were in the process of "re-doing" the menu, so we decided we will give them one more chance when we return to the area.

Convenient to the Argonaut Hotel, limited menu

As hotel restaurants go it's not bad, but I'd recommend branching out to the many restaurants that are within a block or two. The crab chowder was nice.

The food was delicious even though our menu was truncated due to renovations. The shrimp cocktail was worth every penny - order this! He had the half chicken which was tender and juicy, I had the salmon with kale - excellent buerre blanc sauce and gnocchi. I would go back although I'm looking forward to their post-reno menu and the service, while good, wasn't outstanding (no complaints but nothing to write home about). 

Look for a more interesting place....

Food and service are oriented versus turning tables quickly, service is no more than average (close to poor), food is uninspired and the restaurant smells of the kitchen. Not recommendable

I am in San Francisco often for work. This was my first trip to the Blue Mermaid, but it won't be the last. I asked my server Brian what he'd say if I ordered the corn and crab chowder and crab cakes, his response, "I'd say you made a good choice". For starters, the Anchor Steam Lager draft was nice and cold. The chowder was rich and creamy with crab in every bite. The crab cakes aren't lump crab, but you aren't eating filler, very good and the side salad with a sweet dressing was a great accompaniment. Great meal. Brian was friendly and attentive. I'll be back. 

Chowder in a bread Bowl!

So you've ridden the cable car to Fisherman's wharf. Time for lunch. Try for a table on the patio. They have heaters for the cooler days, or for when the fog rolls in, as it invariably will do so close to the Bay. I love the chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. All their chowders are delicious, the bread fresh, the service was excellent, our waitress was funny and engaging, and the food was fresh hot and fast. Remember this is a big meal. Appetizers are not necessary. Also the chowder is a tiny bit on the salty side. Taste it prior to adding any additional seasoning. Other than that, a fun experience not to be missed.

We walked in early on a Monday morning and the place was practically empty. The servers must have not been awake yet. Multiple times I asked for a hot chocolate and a Coffee. Three people came over trying to verify my drink order. Yes, I wanted both. We had to get our own coffee refills despite there being fewer than four tables filled. Food was ok but it took forever. It was a great location and the decor was awesome. However, we won't go back.

The crab chowder was divine. Ceasar Salad was also good. Location was perfect at the end of the pier next to the park and 1 block from Ghirardelli chocolate for dessert.

Was here for our wedding anniversary as we stayed at the Argonaut Hotel right next door. The food was great and the wine was excellent, only because we requested a specific wine and year and they got it for us. Service was also great. Highly recommended place.

I dined alone and felt really comfortable here. Ordered the slider choice of chowders which was delicious and more than enough for one person. A bit pricey but what do you expect for it's location.

We decided to have breakfast here since we were guests at the hotel attached. The menu looked promising with the typical breakfast items including our favourites of eggs benedict and french toast. The hostess was friendly and seated us right away, but the wait staff was brutal. By the time we had the waiter come to us, 15 minutes after being seated and the restaurant was not busy at all, he was rushing us for our order. The food came out before our coffee did and my husbands orange juice did not come til we were half way done our meal. The food was cold and lacked flavour. Not once did the wait staff ask how our food was and brought us the cheque before we were even done. Did not get a top up of water or coffee. For the quality of the food compared to the costs, it is not worth it at all. I think I would have gotten better service at IHOP.

Expensive but just average food.

We were staying at the Arognaut and decided for the sake of convenience to "dine in". The service was a little spotty and the food was just average. We expected more since this was a Noble House hotel. It was very expensive and the food lacked flavor and originality. Save your money go elsewhere.

We stayed at the beautiful Argonaut Hotel for my wife's birthday. We decided to try out the Blue Mermaid for her birthday dinner. The hostess greeted us with a happy birthday but our waiter could not have made our night LESS SPECIAL. No bread when everyone else got some. No refills on water. Not even a simple scoop of ice cream with a candle on it. He didn't even say Happy Birthday to my wife through the entire meal. Only after we left and were on the street did he come running out to say "Happy Birthday by the Way!" As for food, the garlic roasted crab was very good though a bit pricey (55.00). The pan seared salmon was gelatinous and undercooked. What was suppose to be crispy skin, was a soggy mess. If you're staying at the Argonaut, don't bother with this place.

Great restaurant in the old Del Monte cannery. Indoor decor is very cool and there's a huge outdoor patio with fireplaces.We huddled around the fire pits with drinks while waiting for our table. Service was very attentive and the manager stopped by several times to make sure everything was to our liking.The Chef asked if he could surprise us with something that wasn't on the menu (we had friends in town from the East Coast and Europe). He created the most awesome appetizer platter - drawing raves from everyone.We'll be back for sure. Especially when we have friends in town!!

We stopped for breakfast before strolling around pier 39. Between the decor, music, and pleasant service we had a nice relaxing meal. Everything was well prepared and the salmon fresh. It would be good to come back for dinner, the seafood dishes sound fantastic!

My husband and I were visiting and stopped for lunch. The outdoor seating was very inviting. The fire pits were on as it was in the 50's and locals thought it was cold out and we were able to have the area to ourselves! We sat at a cozy two person table beside the pit and were quite comfortable (being from Iowa where there was an ice storm and deadly freeze happening). The calamari was delicious with bits of asparagus! We each had a soup and salad and loved both the corn and crab and the California clam! The balsamic dressing in the house salad was delicious! The meal was perfect and we each enjoyed a local beer as well with our meal. It was a bit expensive for lunch but held us over for most of the day.

What a beautiful little restaurant! This spot was recommended to us by the manager of the Roc, a bar right down the road. We easily made a reservation on open table and were seated right away. Luckily they had two open seats at the bar so we moved over to the bar. The restaurant is beautifully decorated in a nautical theme and it is clean and cute. They offered a pasta special with a glass of wine that is very reasonably priced. My husband had this and I have another pasta dish that was delicious. Our bartender was delightful. She was friendly and warm, not overbearing at all. We had a great meal and a reasonable price and left very happy!
