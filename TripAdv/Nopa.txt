The food here was delicious. I had the roasted chicken meanwhile my friend had the homemade pappardelle and both dishes were really tasty. The problem was that the service was terrible!

Great night, Highly recommended.

Luckily I planned ahead enough to book this restaurant well in advance of our trip to SF. So happy I did. It was exceptional.We arrived to a busy, buzzy atmospheric Saturday night, hungry and ready for a good meal. Our pre dinner cocktails were delicious & strong. well poured! There were 4 of us & we shared several dishes to start. Not one dud. All delicious. We went on the order the whole steak for 4 with side dishes. Fantastic! there was plenty for everyone and it was cooked perfectly. Could not have been better.The room, the staff, the food, the atmosphere was all on the money.Great night, Highly recommended. Just make sure you book in advance!

With so many options in San Francisco, I'm not impressed at all. The food and cocktails are definitely up to SF standards but the service is their downfall. The popularity of this place is overwhelming and it translates to their personnel. Hostesses seemed stressed, our server was all over the place, and the busser was eager to withdraw our plates when there was clearly food left on it. Again, food + beverage, nothing to say there, they are big for a reason, I just didn't enjoy my experience. It felt rushed and uncomfortable. Insiser tip: Ask for your bartender's favorite cocktail that is not on the menu, you will be pleasantly surprised.

We were lucky enough to snag online a dinner reservation just the day before we wanted to dine--a year ago when we visited SF we tried to eat at Nopa but couldn't get in (it had been recommended to us by a resident of San Francisco).I liked our appetizer of 'little fried fish' best of what we ordered--they were delicious (the waiter told us they were anchovies!). I ordered Pappardelle, which was good but not memorable to me. My husband ordered a fish dish that I preferred to my pappardelle. Our son ordered a cheeseburger, which he liked.For dessert we shared pound cake with some kind of brown butter (?) sauce and fruit; I was disappointed in it (I like to bake, so I have pretty high standards).I'm glad we tried Nopa, but I'm not sure at its high price point whether we will return the next time we're back in town.

Always great - our 3rd time!

Lovely setting and interesting, limited menu. The restaurant has interesting cocktails that are both unique and classic in taste, and better than most of the special cocktails offered in San Francisco restaurants. We started with the avocado toast, which is enough for two people and simply out of this world. Perfect texture, taste, and presentation. Two of us had cod and one had braised rabbit - all of the dishes were innovative and good. A side of grilled broccoli with bread crumbs was more than worth ordering and the place was licked clean. We missed by not ordering the wood grilled hamburger - it looked fabulous at the next table and I later heard it is the best of the best. Service was outstanding, but when the prices are such as they are at NOPA and a 20% tip is both expected and was rightfully earned by our server, I was not happy to see an $8.00 "employee benefits" charge added to my bill by the restaurant management. (Especially since I don't know whether they are giving the wait staff healthcare benefits.....) But a good meal and a great experience. Reservations are hard to get, so do plan in advance!

Just fantastic!

While the pork chop is what I fantasised about when booking (It'd been about 7 years since I had it last), the other dishes we had really amazed me.The bean appetizer with hazelnuts was dynamic in color, texture and presentation. The hazelnuts are candied (or something like that) and make the whole dish pop.The standout shocker was the simple tagliatelle bolognese. Normally I wouldn't order such a home-style, old world standard at a nice restaurant. But I saw our neighboring table's dish and had to order it. Sublime. Absolutely perfect.Service was attentive, but not annoying; friendly, but and casual while still maintaining absolute professionalismBravo!!Be warned: this place has some acoustic issues and is quite noisy.

If there's one casual restaurant to visit in San Francisco, this is it. Relaxed atmosphere, fabulous waitstaff and incredible food. It's meant to be shared so go with a few good friends so you can try as much as possible. We tried so many things little fish, gem lettuce and incredible rib eye stand out, and the vegetable dishes were all incredible. Also fun we're the drinks - it's a grown up cocktail list with quirky touches, beautifully served and really very good wine list. One of my favourite dining experiences this year.

Food was good, as one can expect for the prices charged. The ambiance is nice and the restaurant has a lively buzz. We liked the atmosphere but the service seems a bit unorganized and nobody is really in control. Room for improvement here. The toast for the avocado starter was burned but the chicken (main dish) was very good.

We went as a group of four to Nopa for brunch and had four different dishes.- Hamburger: nice, but not out of this world. Good pickled onions, aioli, and French fries.- Fennel sausage with corn bread, pesto, and egg: nice plump sausage, decent corn bread.- House smoked trout on a bagel: the bagel was rather tough.- Harissa braised lamb shoulder: not bad.We also had a pot of coffee, which was good.The service was excellent and very gracious.

We happened to get a last minute reservation. The pork chop is outstanding and they have a good wine list. The chicken was also really good, but not amazing. Service is above average to very good. It's a little expensive but portions for entrees are good. Worth going to if you can get a reservation, not worth waiting for a long time as a walk in.

Our daughter living in SF had a visit to Nopa on her list for some time and when we visited her it was a great opportunity to fulfill this wish.We weren't disappointed at all. The service was excellent and extremely helpful and the food tasted delicious.When we made the reservation and could only get a table at 9pm we were worried that the restaurant would empty out on us while we were enjoying our dinner (has happened to us on occasion). It became quickly clear that we had worried for nothing. The restaurant was full at 9pm (we even had to wait 3-4 minutes for our table to be set) and when we left at 11pm-ish there were still new customers coming in (and all were welcomed with the same friendliness). This created a great buzz that made this a special and memorable experience.Thanks to the whole Nopa Team we'll certainly go back during our next family visit to SF.

I tried to book online a few weeks prior to leaving Australia, but failed to secure a table. Day before we left, I emailed with details of of our dates in SF, hoping for any cancellations. I received an email 2 days later with a reservation secured, thank you. We started with cocktails, and due to a last minute decision to attend a ball game, we had limited time to dine. Not an issue, we were asked to order after we have settled with our drinks and informed that our food will be first on the pass as soon as the kitchen is open. When the food arrived, we really regretted not having more time to sit and savour. We loved every mouthful of the offerings-the respect, dedication and care reflected in the food and the service. Hands down the Best in SF, without all the fuss of fine dining but delivering modern convivial dining. Thank you NOPA. Highlight of our Californian dining experience.

My daughter and son-in-law, both in the food industry, booked Nopa for a dinner which turned out to be excellent. The restaurant is in an older two-story building with a balcony to the side for the second level. The open beams in the ceiling and murals on the walls present an "industrial" atmosphere, but the food was refined and the service, in our case primarily from Gordon, was superb.We shared both appetizers and main courses, so all of us had a wide sample of Nopa's food. The highlight for my daughter and son-in-law was seared Copa di Testa, a charcuterie made from the shoulder and above of a pig, They found the texture smooth and the flavors delicious. I really enjoyed the warm goats' cheese with blueberries and strawberries, though the crostini were a bit too oily. The flatbread with brisket was tasty, but the green garlic soup was too salty.We also shared three main courses. The smoked pork chop was superb and everyone's favorite in this section of the meal. It was also substantial and cooked to our specifications to allow for the variety of preferences in our group. My daughter and son-in-law particularly liked the parpardelle, long thin and wide pasta with a special bolognese sauce. All of us found the halibut a bit underwhelming. This meal left us quite full, so we had only one of the desserts, the blueberry shaved ice with ice cream and a variety of other ingredients. Although we felt the toasted rice was not necessary, all of us enjoyed the dessert.Nopa emphasizes that it is a Californian-style restaurant, but the wine list is primarily European. More importantly, Nopa purchases organic food and the pork chop, for example, came from Iowa as there are no producers in California who can meet Nopa's needs. There was a wide selection of wines, beers and whiskeys and several were both unusual and excellent. We understand that the wine list will be undergoing some revision in the near future.As noted earlier, our service was both friendly and professional. Gordon certainly knew his food and answered our questions with courtesy and insights. Nopa is not inexpensive. We spent just over $100 per person including tip. But, Nopa certainly is an excellent place for that special night out. It is worth noting that too many American restaurants try to turn tables around and have customers eat in 60-90 minutes. We came about 6.30 pm and did not leave until 9.15 pm. We had come to enjoy dinner as our main focus of the evening and Nopa did not let us down. Thus, our dining experience was much more European and Australian than American. Nopa is to be highly commended for this approach.

A top meal!

Thursday night. Place is jam packed. Had to wait till 830 for a table. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE WAIT. Once we were in, we hardly knew so many other people were being served. Service was outstanding. The wine list is very deep and spans the world at veryI fair pricing. I don't know how to start with the food. We ordered one of everything to share amongst the six at the table, and everyone loved everything except for me, not being a headcheese person, I didn't care for it. We even ordered seconds on the asparagus salad. We didn't really need to order desserts, but we did. They were imaginative and full of flavor. However, I would go back for the food and skip dessert. If I lived in San Francisco I would want to go to Nopa at least once a week. It was just fantastic. The restaurant itself is loud and edgy. Lots of hard surfaces in a big room. Hard wood tables and simple plates are the only reason this didn't get 5 stars. Go here if you just want perfect food. It was not expensive either. Most plates were in the $30 range. Wine can be had for under $100 easily per bottle.

We tried getting in to bar area one night and was packed so we made reservations for the next night. This place is very popular and recommend reserving ahead. We started with delicious cocktails. Had the roasted carrots and the anchovy app as my entree. Others in our party had the baked chicken entree and fish. The menu does change so may be different later. The service was excellent and we were well taken care of in every way! Helped us with wine selections, dessert, and dessert wine. There is an extensive wine and dessert wine menu. Everything was superb and hope to go back one day.

Since it's opening eleven years ago, I've been to Nopa dozen of times, literally. My friend and I decided to go there pre-Hamilton the other night adding pre-theatre to the list of occasions that brought us there in the past: birthdays, engagements, births, deaths and spontaneous friend combustions. The thing about Nopa is the attention they pay to details, like the perfectly cooked french fries that temporarily make you forget your friend is talking to you. Like young servers such as Hannah and Andy who keep such a close eye on their slightly tipsy guests even though it's ten minutes to closing and it's probably been a long night for them. Bartenders like Jason and Justin never forget your drink and never leave you empty. I want to write about the Burger but then I'll get hungry and I'll want to go to Nopa again tonight and have another one. Still the best food in the city. Still the most consistent. And still something special every visit even after eleven years. I believe Nopa is entering Iconic status but hey, just go have a drink there; It's really a happy place.

Went to Nopa on a Monday evening after putting our names down just an hour earlier and receiving a call when our table was ready. We found that very convenient. The place was lively and noisy but we didn't have trouble with conversation across the table. I prefer cider to beer and I enjoyed a Basque Cider that was much less sweet than typical American ciders and had an interesting finish (like olives I thought). My husband and I ordered the fries and flatbread with ham to start. Both were yummy. For entrees We ordered the vegetarian Moroccan Tangine and the pasta with sausage. The Tangine was topped with an unusual but delicious lemon yogurt which cut the spiciness. The pasta was wonderfully al dente and had plenty of fennel spiced sausage. Both were very good and the portion sizes were more than reasonable. For dessert we tried the panna cotta, a light but flavorful end to the meal. The service was efficient and sufficiently attentive. We would certainly return on a subsequent visit to SF.

It's essential to make reservations for Nopa if you don't want to experience a long wait. It's a lively restaurant, with people enjoying themselves and the food very much. We were there for brunch, and the four of us had a difficult time deciding what we wanted, so we over-ordered. The sweet cardamom buns, oven baked eggs, custard French toast, goat cheese bread pudding, soft scrambled eggs (mushroom toast, panna, shaved pantaleo and arugula) with two sides of the house smoked bacon, left us fully sated and well pleased. Nice French-press coffee with organic sugar was the perfect beverage for this meal.

Nopa has been one of my most anticipated restaurants to visit ever since I moved to SF two years ago. Everyone I met said they absolutely loved it and that the food was to die for. I was finally able to get reservations (8:45pm the earliest) and was looking forward to a memorable dinner. Arrived 5 minutes early, waited a couple of minutes to be seated and the night seemed to have started off on the right foot. It didn't take long for our experience to go downhill the moment we took our seats. Our waitress seemed very sweet and helpful with any questions we had. She recommended the pork chops (she informed they were cooked medium rare) and my cousin ordered a NY steak, medium rare as well.The food takes about 45 minutes to come out which is fine, we were in a good mood and drinking wine so it wasn't a big deal. However, I really dislike when the waiter/waitress does not check up on our meals after them being delivered by another person. The woman who gave us our meals completely switched our plates and little did we know we were eating each other's food. So here I am eating my cousins food believing it was my pork chops and I'm thinking this is the chewiest red meat I've ever had and my cousin returned his so believed steak (it came well done-my pork chops, I'm sure you get it my now) to have it cooked correctly this time. While he waits, another waiter comes by with caramelized brussels sprouts which were quite tasty and nice from their part since they messed up the first time. Then we ask for another glass of wine and another waiter comes back with milk...LOL. Did it maybe since strange that a grown man with another woman drinking wine could possibly order milk? Let's move on....They finally come back with his order and tell him this time it's the pork chops and that's the moment we realize we were eating the wrong plates. Tell the waiter again and he apologized profusely and all this time I'm thinking where the heck is our waitress. Speak of the devil and she shows up out of nowhere and asks if everything is ok since she heard there was a mixup and I'm just here looking at her like where were you 20 minutes ago when we first got our food served. They tried to fix it by offering a free dessert but we were honestly so stuffed and tired that we really just wanted to leave. God forbid we ask for a dessert and they bring us back whatever plate they felt like grabbing that time. Listen, I've worked in restaurants before and I get it, mistakes happen and we didn't give them a hard time AT ALL, but this was just too much, especially for the price we payed. I'm sure this would've been a much nicer experience if the female chef with the gray hair and the other chef with the black hat backwards weren't too busy chewing each other's ears off, maybe then our pork chops-believed-to-be NY steak would've been cooked correctly the first time. That's what happens when you seat someone at table 63 on the second floor, I noticed everything like a hawk.

We met my neice who had just grabbed a beverage at a bar table and moved immediately to a restuarant table when they opened do service right at 6 PM. So glad we had Gordon as our waiter. He was very knowledgeable about everything they served, frequently checked in with us, kept up with drinks and additional orders as we chose to follow his advice and get multiple starters to share. This is most likely the best server I have ever had in a totally packed restuarant! We loved the brussel sprouts, flat bread, warm goat cheese with pear slices and young kale salad. While I have never liked kale, I surprisingly found the kale salad to be quite good with the chefs chosen ingredients. The blanco margarita we requested was excellent as well as the mule. I will definitely consider eating here again if I am back in San Francisco and my neice who is local will be right back! Excellent choice for dinner and drinks!!

This is a great restaurant with nice atmosphere.I arrived at the restaurant on friday at about 5:30pm without a reservation, and was offered to be seated at one of the long table, which is absolutely fine for solo traveller. However if you have a big group and prefer more privacy, reservation is recommended as the restaurant is packed.If you arrive before 6 like me, please note that they would only start taking dinner order at 6, you can order drinks and snacks before that.I ordered the celery soup and the pork chop. The soup is very creamy. The pork chop is just divine, the hint of spiciness is a great touch.The waitresses is very attentive and friendly.I highly recommend this restaurant.

There is a great energy and Vibe about the place.The food was tasty and served hot. Our table was upstairs so it was fun to watch the action. The only downside was we had a large table behind us, thus it was really noisy. What really works here along with the very good food is the seamless transition of food service staff who work as a team and don't miss a beat! I'd definately go back!

Nopa still has their first holiday whisky list available for tasting which was an unexpected surprise. They had many hard to find bottles with reasonable pricing. Our server was knowledgeable and provided attentive service without making us feel rushed. Definitely recommended!

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very pleasant. There is a bar area, which is separated from the dining area with a small division wall, which works perfectly as the bar area is very busy and noisy. The kitchen is open, you can see all the employees busy preparing your dishes. The service was really pleasant. We didn't know which wine to choose so they gave us a taste of the ones they were selling by glass to help us choose. The menu seems to change on a daily basis, but in general it is composed of mostly tapa-sized dishes, so we ordered 5 dishes and were very happy with the quantity of dishes. I don't have a complete recollection of which dishes we had, but in a nutshell: warm goat cheese spread, chicory salad, smoked brisket, smoked trout, and baked beans. Every dish was delicious and a good choice. Together with a desert to share and a bottle of Sonoma Valley red wine the dinner was about $180 - not cheap, but definitely worth it.

The place to enjoy great ketchup

Seriously NOPA has great food, an urban dining experience ( read that as noisy) and superb ketchup for the signature hamburger dish. However all the food from appetizers to deserts is excellent and the service too. Trendy and busy , NOPA brims with youth and energy , so while I may have 30 years of age over most diners , for SF urban dining - I was frankly very delighted by my experience.

Lots of fans give the rustic farmhouse-style dining room a lively atmosphere. Service is super friendly, northern California fashion. The food is tasty. The pork chop I had was disappointing - too undercooked and not juicy enough - although the accompaniments were full of goodness. Nopa n'est pas Noma.

We arrived before dinner service started but were able to grab some drinks and snacks at the bar which were delicious. Seated promptly at 6pm and from there received fabulous friendly service. The food is wonderful. You must try the pork chop - it is outstanding. So juicy and succulent, not to mention huge!

Nice atmosphere, decent food.

Met some friends there and started at the bar. Bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. Front staff were very nice and seated us on time. Sat upstairs which provides an interesting view of the dining area. Food and alcohol was a decent price, with a pretty good selection of wine. Since I was visiting from out of state, not sure if I would necessarily recommend to visitors, but I did enjoy my meal.

My family had dinner recently at Nopa. We really enjoyed the service, cocktails, food and wine. This is "sensible" food with solid choices for starters and main dishes, I found the wine selections to be plentiful and pricing is fair. Thankfully not a tasting menu, food art, kind of place.

Great Teamwork

We had a reservation for three on a Thursday night and we were promptly seated when we arrived. There was a line but nice to have our time honored. Our table was upstairs in a corner, which would not have been my preference, and I've noticed hosts in the Bay Area do not ask you if a table in a certain area is acceptable. The main level is open and boisterous while the upstairs seems nicer for couples or quieter conversation. Service style is excellent team oriented so one never waits or wants for anything. Menu is interesting and diverse with lots of options for a vegan if you hold the cheese or have it on the side. Ingredients are great and very clean preparations.

There is rarely a time of the day Nopa is not busy, it would be a lucky day if you could easy to walk in without a line... Although the food is modern and delicious, atmosphere is fun and lively, there are just too many good places in town to wait a line that long. But if you ever to make it in.. make sure to get a cocktail from the bar... good luck :)

We made saturday brunch reservations a month ahead and our experience here with our server wasnt the best, but our food was very good. We ordered a poached egg well done and it came runny. Returned it and it came back runny again. The server didnt do anything about it.This is where kathyln the manager came to our rescue. She was so helpful and went above and beyond for us. She turned around the experience. So make sure you check this place out. It is good and does have good management! Thank you kathlyn!

Love the atmosphere at this place. It is funky & modern, but calm and collected. The staff were busy but still great, I picked up a wine list half way through our meal and started to google some of the wines and one of the senior waitresses must have seen and bounded over to give me expert advice on the wine list (which I loved)My husband had the pork..... Amazing. The kids shared a pasta (a bit small for the price) but tasty. My parents shared the chicken (not bad)I had the hamburger (I wouldn't order it again)My meal was well presented and the meat was tasty, but my advice is don't order it, there are plenty of other things that are fabulous on the menu. Go to a burger bar for a boring burger, order something more adventurous and exotic here. Our bill was a lot. So really it was a great night out. Slightly more than I wanted to spend and I wish I'd ordered real food but I would absolutely go there again.

Had seen the reviews and wanted to eat here, though anticipated a long wait, due to no reservation and its popularity. Initially given a 30 minute wait time, but had no time to even order a drink at the bar when the waitress showed us to a table. Food was delicious and we were very impressed with both the wine list and the waitress's knowledge of it. She understood what we were looking for and guided us through the extensive array of wines with skill. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and will certainly return when next in San Francisco.

We decided to eat here on the spur of the moment when visiting San Francisco. Although we had no reservation we only had to hover at the bar for about 20 mins on a Sunday night before we got a seat. As the staff were very attentive and the bar spacious and made to feel like part of the restaurant we had no problems eating here instead of at a table. The food was divine and I struggled to make a selection as there was so much I wanted to try. The wine list and cocktails were very impressive too. If I lived in SF this would definitely be a favourite of mine. It is a little expensive but so very worth it.

On this particular trip to the states the dinner we had at Nopa stands head and shoulders above the rest. Even when choosing what we were going to have the waiter was very knowledgable about every dish on the menu and happy to share his favourites too. To start we shared the pork and apple flatbread which was nice. For main I had a 9-hour bolognaise with freshly made papperdelle pasta which was very nice. Great depth of flavour. One of my friends had the pork chop which was definitely the winner though! Pretty big portion but very tasty. For desert I had rice pudding balls which were like a sweet arancini. Went very well with the apple and raspberry that were served with it which cut through the creaminess nicely. Wine recommendations were top notch too.

Went on a Tuesday for dinner and drinks, packed. 1.5 hour wait for a table, we didn't have reservations which I strongly suggest if u want a table, so we tried our luck jockeying for position at the bar or very large table next to bar. The bar tenders are VERY attentive to those patrons waiting for table or bar spot, pretty much hand u a drink menu as soon as u step foot near the bar! Can order off menu for food as soon as u sit at bar. Really, get the avocado toast.

The restaurant opens at 5 pm for tapas & drinks. After 6 pm dinner till 1 am. It's the greatest dinner experience I had eating by the kitchen area counter. Got to see everything and even chat with the chef who was very nice to explain all the different dishes . His suggestions were all excellent. I try the salmon taps & squash ones. Their cheesecake was to die for very tasty And satisfying. No mater what you order here it will be excellent & tasteful.

This place was recommended and it was first class, plus it was handy for where we were staying.

The restaurant also had a great vibe and a super selection of beers.I would definitely recommend it.

The design is very nice and you can enjoy the environment if you are ready for a loud place, for a PUB. It is loud from people not from a music. The taste is unique, certainly the chef gives high importance to herbs he is using and he is using a big variety of herbs in each dish. Obviously, their expertise is in the Chicken dish they are offering. They have a special oven for the chicken and it is full with 8-12 of those at any time. Less for family, recommended for young couples or young group of people.

Stopped in for pre dinner drinks mid week because we could not get a reservation due to the crowd. The bar serves up creative cocktails and has a lot of energy. The bar is not well laid out and it can feel pretty crowded as its part of the larger restaurant with only a half wall separating the two. Bartenders were efficient and friendly.

This was another recommendation by our concierge, and my favourite restaurant we visited on our trip. We were given a great table on the mezzanine overlooking the whole dining room, bar and kitchen - the atmosphere even on a Wednesday night was fantastic. I had the pork chop, which while a simple dish it tasted sublime. Service was unfussy and friendly with some good wine recommendations. An absolute must visit.

On a recent trip to SF, had hoped to get here for dinner but could not find a time that worked so went for Sunday brunch instead...LUCKY DAY!! Great brunch menu, great choices. The butter basted eggs, and soft scrambled were perfectly served, really good flavor in both dishes, my son had a burger and loved it. As suggested we shared a custard french toast for the table as a finisher, and what a way to finish it was!! Still would like to try the dinner menu, but would not hesitate on a brunch date again!!

Nopa is one of those almost mythical restaurants where you must make a reservation 60 days in advance. So expectations are high - and the restaurant met those expectations.The atmosphere is San Francisco hip - noisy, young (and presumably wealthy) clientele and a high energy vibe. The bar is relatively small but we were able to get drinks from a friendly bartender while we had a short weight for our table.Our server was excellent - knowledgeable, friendly and lacking the snooty attitude which has become too common in popular restaurants.Everything was delicious - grilled calamari, warm olives, hamburger, pork chop, grilled broccoli, and dark chocolate cream pie were prepared to perfection.

We had a great time at Nopa, we didn't have a reservation and on a Saturday we thought we might have to skip this place but we happily found seats at the bar. The service was great and the food was awesome! It's not a budget friendly place to eat but where in Cali is? I had the mimosa, which was good but pricey for the size. The strawberry cava wasn't as good so I wished I had just stuck to the mimosa. We ordered the muffin first which was very flavorful. I had the soft scrambled eggs and it was really good, I highly recommend this dish. Everyone I was with seemed happy with what they got and I was happy we got in. 

Absolutely the best pork chop EVER

We knew that Nopa had the best pork chops IN THE UNIVERSE from previous visits, but had not been able to enjoy them for several years. We were thrilled to return and find that they are STILL the best ever - truly. The portion is huge and we can attest that our leftover meat was just as tasty the next day, even without reheating!During our recent visit, we found the food and service to be excellent. Extra kudos to our server who was familiar with the restrictions of a gluten free diet, even understanding the importance of avoiding cross-contamination for my husband's celiac disease. We found the menu and overall experience to be very gluten free-friendly. We've heard that their roast chicken is also to die for, but we can't bring ourselves to bypass those pork chops! They have a nice wine list, including numerous offerings of half-bottles of fine wines.Looking forward to many more return visits!Do be aware that it is a very lively restaurant with noise levels that correspond - so not the ideal spot for an intimate gathering.

This is the place chefs come to so you know it's good. Atmosphere is modern and noisy because it's been crowded every time I've been there. Service is good. Be sure and make a reservation.

We waited for ages in a long queue only to be told they were not serving for another hour. It was a confused system where they spent ages chatting to people at the front, leaving the rest of us waiting behind. It may be a culture difference as we are from the UK, but we found this a bit rude and the staff were quite condescending. Instead we ate somewhere else nearby (The Green Chili Kitchen which was delicious, relaxed and great value Mexican)
