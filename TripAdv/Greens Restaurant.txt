Perfect Dining Experience

After almost a week in California with nothing but "afterthought" salads to eat, we were ready for some decent vegetarian food, so it was pretty lucky we found ourselves in San Francisco and heard about Greens.The restaurant is large and very stylishly appointed with views over the bay and the Golden Gate bridge, and from the moment we walked in and were shown to our table I knew we were in for something special.It was clear that finding the place was cause for celebration, so we started the ball rolling with a couple of delicious cocktails. The starters arrived and were so beautifully and stylishly presented that it seemed a shame to eat them, but with flavour to surpass their looks we tucked in.And so it continued... sublime main courses and desserts complemented by attentive but unintrusive service.As well as being vegetarian, I'm coeliac and by now it will probably come as no surprise to hear that the waiter was able to guide me as to what on the menu was gluten free, which turned out to be most of it, so I had plenty of choice for once. I don't tend to eat in vegetarian restaurants in the UK, but I'd rate Greens as one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at, vegetarian or not! I really can't recommend the place enough, our experience was perfect in every way!

Nothing special

Greens was recommended in our guide book and had popped up on a few blogs when I was doing research so we decided to book for a Monday night. We arrived at 8pm and were one of the last to be seated which meant the restaurant didn't have much atmosphere as the tables were spread out and it had huge high ceilings. It was also very cold by the window so had to put my jumper on. The food was fine, but I think if you are a vegetarian restaurant then you need to make sure your food is packing in the flavour. Everything was very bland - we shared the cauliflower griddle cakes which were nothing special and both had the spinach ricotta ravioli which was quite tasteless. The espresso pudding made up for it which was delicious. All in all I wouldn't go again, I get the impression they are still dining out on their historic reputation from the 80s and have failed to keep up with current standards. The ambiance could be improved by making it cosier, playing music and seasoning their food.

I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant, a vegetarian spot founded by Buddhists. The location, right off the bat, is amazing. Right on the water near Ft. Mason. You can see the Golden Gate Bridge. The wine list is superb. The service is fantastic. The atmosphere is special. Not too loud, not too soft, just right. I enjoyed a sandwich made with heirloom tomatoes and goat cheese on bread that was beyond delicious. We started with a sparkling wine toast and ended with coffee and a pot of creme dessert that still gives my mouth warm fuzzy feelings. Eat here. Just drop everything and eat here.

OK...this gem is a bit tucked away. But once you arrive, you are immediately surrounded by the most beautiful dining space - complete with redwood influences and big paned windows overlooking the marina and the Golden Gate bridge. And...your experience is just beginning.This place has a wonderful bar and offers an extensive collection of wines by the bottle with some offered by the glass as well. Our server knew the list well and guided us to a selection that proved to be a well-made one.The food - I don't even know where to begin. The menu rotates and different vegan/vegetarian(?) dishes are offered. There is a lot to choose from and the dishes are unique, creative and well presented - offering a lot of unexpected options. All I can say is that I have never had any thing that didn't leave me feeling infinitely satisfied and even intrigued and definitely wanting more. For my veg/vegan friends, run don't walk to this place. You won't be disappointed.

My husband booked this venue for a birthday brunch, he knows I am fussy and want a good veggie selection. Greens most definitely has it!We had a wonderful window seat (worth reserving if you can) overlooking the harbor, with a back drop of the Golden Gate Bridge. The staff were very welcoming and chatty, especially to my daughter.All our food had a lovely Mexican spice twist, but was also incredibly light. The coffee kept flowing and the mimosas perfect. Strongly recommend for both the views and food.

I have been to this restaurant a couple years ago and then on this trip to SF the people I met up with brought me here. As in the two past visits, I was again very disappointed! The food had odd flavors that were not enjoyable at all!! The biscuits were doughy in the center. There were 5 of us in our party and not one of us liked our meals! It is quite expensive for food that we did not even want to eat. We will not be back!!!

Dining with Golden Gate views 
Rating: 4
Date: September 9, 2017
My date and I chose Greens Restaurant because of the view of the Golden Gate Bridge. It is hidden in an old military complex that seemed almost abandoned at night, however our cab driver found it easily. We were seated and tended to right away. The dining area was filled with many types of customers, families with children, business affiliates, couples, friend groups etc. Dress was also diverse..casual, business, upscale. We both felt that our choices of food (grilled peaches, spring rolls, green curry, poblano chili) were gratifying in all ways. The chef understands how to pull together and blend many flavors into one yummy dish! All food came promptly...maybe even too fast as we were not given a chance to linger very long before the next course was served. Due to the fog, our views of the bridge were sporadic, however we appreciated our night out nevertheless.

Simply an amazing Vegan Lunch overlooking the east harbour and San Francisco bay. The place has an view and the food is really too good. For visitors from India this is a must do eatery when one visits SFO. The place is located inside the Fort Mason center and is also close to Ghirardelli Square, Powell Hyde cable car turntable, Maritime Museum and Pier 39 on the Embarcadero. The place offers good food and also wine and beer. Make sure to consume the beer/ wine inside as takeaways are not allowed for alcoholic beverages. There is also a good takeaway inside the restaurant.

My wife and I dined at Greens last night. Everything--food, service, ambiance, views--was outstanding. We HIGHLY recommend Greens. We had a great dining experience from the moment we walked in the door until we left. Our server Jessica was a true professional and took excellent care of us. The food is terrific/fresh/tasty. The spinach raviolis were fantastico. My wife's dessert--a strawberry almond cake with blackberry sorbet--was absolutely heavenly. This is not a cheap place to eat, but it is definitely worth the money when you factor in the overall quality of the food, service and spectacular views.

Had a wonderful table by the window watching the sunset over the Bridge - truly memorable. There is a lovely atmosphere in this converted warehouse. We were a family of four, one vegetarian. I had an tasty meal - chose two starters the best being the spring rolls which were excellent. My husband had a rather disappointing veg chilli (the one I make is apparently much better!) and there was a rather lukewarm minestrone and some quite tasty pasta. So overall we thought over priced for some nice but not spectacular vegetarian fare but we had a great evening nonetheless.

We selected Greens because my wife is vegetarian and finding veggie/vegan dinners done well is a treat. This place exceeded our expectations. What a great meal! We were able to make a reservation about 4 hours in advance of our selected dinner time. Staying in a hotel on Lombard, the walk through the area to Greens was lovely. Lots of activity about. We arrived just as the sun was beginning to set. I'd asked the host on the phone if the restaurant had nice views across the bay or of the harbor. When they seated us, it was clear that the host had picked this table out just for us based on that question. Being from out of town, we really appreciated that. We started off with the grilled bluff peaches, goat cheese and honey. Delicious. Entrees were all wonderful: Gratin Provencal, Spinach Ravioli, and Broccoli di Ciccio and Cherry Tomato pizza. Wine selection was beautiful and plentiful. Service was attentive and professional, timed perfectly and we never felt rushed. All in all, a really memorable night. One thing to note: Greens was listed as a $$ place. Our group of 3 spent $180 with tip for a single first course, a glass of wine, and 3 main course meals, which is more than I'd expect for a $$ place. Not a critique against the restaurant, but rather a note that the menu price possibly should be upgraded.

We come to Greens from time to time because of its good food and great views. We went for lunch (always make reservations) and had Grilled Blossom Bluff Peaches (I was trying to figure out what type of peaches this was, not knowing that what it meant was Blossom Bluff ORCHARD peaches); Grilled Eggplant Sandwich with tomatoes, roasted onion, mozzarella, arugula; Almond cake with Blueberry compote and peach sorbet. All three dishes were excellently prepared; service was very good. It is nice to see that after so many years their standards have remained high. Oh, and we saw Annie Somerville (executive chef) checking things out. All in all a very nice luncheon.

Ate heer to watch the sunset...but the blinds were down! Understandable, as the sun was very bright...but still.The food was good and enjoyable but our waiter seemed unfriendly and a bit disinterested. We are quite friendly and chatty....I don't think we had a single smile in 90 mins. So much that I actually undercut the usual minimum tip i'd give in the US.I asked for a cooler for our bottle of white wine and it was treated as a shock that anyone would want to protect the wine from being room temperature.Other than that, the food was good and the view great.

Prior to arriving in San Francisco, I'd had a look for some vegan / vegetarian eats and was pleasantly surprised to find so many places, with enough positive reviews to match! Green's was no different. We had booked for 8pm but arrived at 7:15pm, and they were able to accommodate us within minutes. The serving staff were excellent, but not intrusive, in how attentive they were - glasses were always full of water, plates cleared away quickly, never lingering. We chose the 'sampler' starter, which was absolutely delicious (the cauliflower was a real highlight) and a good way to familiarise yourself with the flavours and techniques of the restaurant. For main, I had the signature grilled brochettes, and my boyfriend had their artisan pizza. My brochettes were bursting with flavour - a delicious sauce was slathered across a variety of vegetables, served with perfectly cooked rice! Yum. Upon consultation with my boyfriend, he concluded that the pizza could have done with a bit more flavour, but that didn't deter us from ordering a dessert each. The vegan almond cake for me - I'd usually never order something that wasn't chocolatey for dessert, but it was a brave new world for me that night. So flavoursome, fruity and light that I had all the enjoyment of a rich, indulgent pudding, with none of the guilt - the peach sorbet melted in your mouth and perfectly complemented the blueberry compote. My boyfriend opted for the flourless chocolate torte with salted caramel and caramel ice cream. His verdict? 'An 8/10 dessert. The torte was cooked to perfection and it didn't have any pastry which was nice - pure chocolate. Ice cream and honeycomb was also delicious.' In his words, to go above 8/10 it has to be 'really really fantastic'. Nonetheless, this dessert was 'amazing'. Topped off with a 'ginger by the sea' cocktail, we had a lovely evening. That said, the wine list was prohibitively expensive for our budget, but we understand that we are probably poorer than the average clientele - and opted for a blow out celebration on holiday! So, at this place, you certainly get what you pay for - two extremely happy customers. The view of the bay, complete with sunset, was priceless in itself, too.

The service was excellent but not oppressive. Excellent suggestions that helped us decide on what and how much to order. Inspired uses of gourmet mushrooms in a couple dishes. Bold seasoning on the Morrocan philo entree that I appreciated. A bit pricey at $150 w/tip for two drinks, one glass of wine, two appetizers, one entree and one dessert. Entree portions are large. We were there ar sunset and given a beautiful view table that was unfortunately very warm as well from the sun and lack of ventilation. Tips: Get the Ginger on the Beach drink if you like rum. The grilled peach appetizer was a hit. And, if you are not put off by bold spices try the Moroccan mushroom stuffed philo on chickpeas.

We had a noon lunch reservation with friends from overseas. This is one of my favorite SF eateries - but although we were early, we were seated at the last table along the windows which was very tight even though other tables were available. We asked about the other tables available and were told that wasn't possible - it was a Wednesday. I had reserved 3 weeks before, requested a window but this table was not meant for 4 and was impossible to enter without having the table next to us move. Disappointing. The food as always is a respite of fresh local ingredients and our guests who had been traveling for several weeks greatly appreciated the diversity of vegetables. The sampler plate was lovely and generous, likewise the brochettes where wonderful. The curry was a little earthy and didn't quite work. The humus appetizer is really for no more than two and although it comes with two spreads, pita is minimal. I love brunch at Greens but lunch was a bit disappointing, except for the sampler .

I went here with a friend for lunch recently and was reminded why this place has been an institution for so many years (decades!). First of all, the atmosphere is wonderful. Tall ceilings, fantastical redwood burl furniture, and the best views over the water. My friend got pasta with morels and peas, and it was easily one of the best pasta dishes either of us have ever had. It was flavorful and rich without being heavy. The peas were perfectly cooked--not too crunchy and not too soggy.I got tofu kebabs. I don't know why because I don't love tofu, but they sounded good. And I was so glad I did! The tofu had the most delicious wood-grilled flavor and the veggies and sides were so healthy and delicious--and filling!Lunches were very hearty sizes... neither of us needed dinner that night.Service was good and friendly. Just right. Our meals took some time in coming and our server kept coming over to give us updates and make sure we were happy, which we were.I recommend this place to anyone, even if you're not a vegetarian.

Greens is a well known vegetarian restaurant with nice views of the Golden Gate Bridge and marina. I recommend reservations and allow about 15 minutes travel from downtown (Union Square area). The portions are large and the food is very fresh, well prepared and filling. The beet salad is wonderful! I also had the Tofu brouchettes. You can order either one or two. One was more than enough with the sides. The only disappointment was the slaw. It was not bad, just not good enough to warrant wasting anything else! I had the flourless chocolate torte for dessert and it was delicious. They have a nice wine menu as well. Service was good and we were served quickly. I highly recommend you give this a try if you would like to have a substantial vegetarian meal!

I've had one memorable lunch meal at Greens with pasta and Chanterelle mushrooms years ago and one not so great dinner meal here decades ago with friends who always recall the trauma of a dish deserved here with a sliver of what I could recall looked like an egg frittata with a single green pea to garnish. They are of course, carnivores, who relish savory, large servings with a reasonable price point. I recommended trying Greens again as it was my pick this time and they were pleasantly surprised that the serving portions were decent and tasty. Still, you can probably get similar meals at other vegetarian restaurants which wouldn't cost you $200 for 4 (including 3 cocktails and 1 coffee). There was even a view at sunset as the shades were all pulled down to keep the sunlight out of people's eyes.Service was good, food was good. Portion sizes were better than in the past.

 We ate here for our last dinner on our round the world trip as a treat. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance and the service was friendly and attentive. Having eaten an American sized brunch we didn't arrive as hungry as we had hoped so only ordered mains and split a dessert. Mains were good, portions fair however there were a few things that could have been better. The peas in the pasta main were quite hard and not the freshest, as a star ingredient this should have been better. Some of the vegetables in the brochette were a little al dente and the rice a little lukewarm. I am not picking but for the premium price these things should be picked up on. We shared the chocolate mousse for dessert which was delicious and decadent. All in all a good meal, just not spectacular especially given the cost.

I have been visiting Greens every few years for the last 27 years. The setting is stunning and the food has been excellent and inspiring. I have never had bad service. So our meal last night was huge disappointment and a shock. We were left waiting, despite having booked, with no menu or offer of drinks. My chili sounded delicious on paper but in reality was bitter-tasting, luke-warm slop. The kale side was inedible. The warm cauliflower salad was dumped on the plate with less thought than you expect in a school canteen. Only the chocolate cake, the wine and the nervous waiter saved the meal from utter failure. Please, whoever runs this iconic restaurant these days, save it! I will be back to check but only because of my fond memories of previous meals. One more like last night's and I shall never return again.

We are relatively new vegetarians and since we were coming to San Francisco we thought it would be a good opportunity to try a really good restaurant that specializes in only vegetarian food. Nice to have a whole menu of options and a view of the harbour, too. We sat at the window and watched the seals. Unlike many of the old vegetarian restaurants I'm familiar with, this one felt like a real dining experience, a place you could bring your non-vegetarian friends and they wouldn't feel like they were being deprived. We went for lunch; I had the soft tacos made with butternut squash, red cabbage, avocadoes, etc. My husband had the mesquite grilled brochettes. Both were delicious. The butterscotch pot de creme dessert is amazing and really shouldn't be missed (if you eat dairy). They have a good selection of wines, too.

We had a table right by the window overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. We enjoyed a romantic meal. The cheese board to start was excellent as was the Thali. A real treat for 1 vegetarian and 1 kind of vegetarian. 

Nice Anniversary Lunch
Rating: 4
Date: April 14, 2017
Have always wanted to eat here while visiting San Fran and after about 30 years finally did so for our anniversary lunch. A very nice setting in the Marina area (Don't be deterred by the outside). Casual, relaxed yet nice interior. Both our meals were excellent (Indian Thali & Pappardelle pasta). Our server was very friendly but it appeared as if she had too many tables to handle so her attentiveness was minimal although we were in no hurry and enjoyed the experience. One oddity that we had never encountered before--the wine list listed wines by the "half" "glass" and "bottle" Never had encountered that before and it was a bit confusing at first yet we finally got it. The wine and food was a bit expensive (about $20 each for our light lunch choices), and $11-17/glass. Yet, overall a positive experience and will likely return.

We'd visited Greens last year already. Last year we hope for good food this year we had the expectation for good food and a nice evening. Fortunately those expectations were fulfilled. The food was just delicious and the staff was attentive and nice. You really need to book beforehand otherwise you might not get a table.

One of the best views of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Vegetarian fair like you have never had before. This restaurant has California produce and wines at it's freshest and finest. Brunch on weekends, lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed. And to top it off, a view of the Maina harbor and the Golden Gate Bridge!

Really wonderful flavors in all the dishes. Servings were ample and most of ours were shared. The hummous with tomato jam, delish! The spring rolls were great. Soft tacos and brochette were hits at our table. Service impeccable and the drink selection nice. Fabulous view of the Bay!!

An upscale, albeit "old school" kind of vegetarian restaurant. Ambiance & atmosphere: Two cavernous rooms yet it thankfully wasn't as loud as I thought it might be. Unfortunately, we weren't seated in the more attractive and creatively furnished front room but our table was comfortable and both rooms are super-spacious - this would be a good place for a large group. Good service for the most part; i.e. attentive yet not overly solicitous.Food: This is fairly pricey but well-made - very tasty and nicely plated. Vegans should note that the majority of the entrees tend to contain dairy. The night we went, we were able to get veganized versions of the Mushroom Shepherd's Pie and Poblano Chile, but it should be noted that our server warned us that the kitchen would need time to veganize the dishes - 40 minutes, to be exact.Other reviewers have mentioned the prices and moderate portions, which I was happy with. I am not expecting or wanting a gigantic dish at an establishment like this; I realize I'm paying for high-quality ingredients and a lot of labor for our well-made and attractively plated food. We also sampled the Spring Rolls (good) and for dessert, the vegan sorbet dish (very good!) That said, I wish more of the menu items - particularly the dinner entrees - were vegan by default; the heavy use of dairy seems out of step with the plant-based food trends taking place in the Bay area as well as the country as a whole.This is a "once in a while" kind of restaurant to go to if you want a special vegetarian experience.

This was my second visit to Greens when on a trip to San Francisco! The food is amazing! I had the Green Curry and my friend had the Papadelle and both were great. We shared a bottle of a crisp white wine that the waiter so graciously helped us pick out and we had the butterscotch dessert! I took the Cable Car to the Wharf and then walked the mile from there to the restaurant and it was a fairly easy walk. I highly recommend this place!

This popular restaurant is definitely worth a visit. San Francisco and indeed the US is way behind other countries in offering vegetarian options in mainstream restaurants, unless you want to eat a "veggie patty" every night. The food and the wine at this restaurant was excellent. I've not given five stars simply because it's very expensive. It's not too far to walk to from the tourist area at Fishermans Wharf, about a mile, however be aware that Apple maps guides you through an unlit park area. A very nice meal in a nice environment.

This is a marvelous spot with unique ambiance in a beautiful space. The service was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our lovely waitress. This is the sort of vegetarian food that leaves you convinced that the chef is actually interested in creativity and heartiness not just making healthy meat alternatives. Everything we ate (which was a lot!) was stupendous.

Greens restaurant came highly recommended to us even though we are not vegetarians. Had we known the view would be spectacular we would have booked earlier reservations to enjoy the view and walking paths nearby. Regardless, the food was delicious! The salad was fresh and enjoyable. The shepherds pie was filled with mushrooms so you've got to enjoy that to order this entree. The green curry was quite tasty. The vegan chocolate mousse with vegan coconut sorbet were both delicious as well! Steve out server was great! Only downfall was the first item on the menu was sold out by 7:30pm. Bummer!

I know I am in the minority here but found this to be the worst meal I had in SF in a recent trip. I will preface that I am vegetarian and have had very delicious vegetarian meals before. The service was ok and not friendly, and the food was very average. I got the spring rolls and a cup of soup which were both okay, but pretty bland and not memorable. My boyfriend got the roasted chili stuffed with quinoa which was equally bland and unmemorable. On top of everything the food was ridiculously expensive and small portions, which I would be fine with if the food or service had been good. My three stars for location and decorations alone!

Walked in at 6PM Saturday and lucked into a table near the bar and entrance (I'd recommend reservations; it is a large place but popular). Our table was uniquely fashioned from a large part of a tree and though knee room was minimal it was a cool table. We were still able to take in the sunset through the GG Bridge, as most tables have a view west at a marina and toward the Bridge. Our waiter was friendly, efficient, freely provided accurate drink and food recommendations, especially important as menu is all vegetarian. Drinks were excellent: Negroni, watermelon margarita and champagne. First course of roasted Hamada Farm figs and burrata, and a cauliflower sort of mini-muffin were both delicious. I went for wild mushroom shepherd's pie as "meat like" dish and was thrilled at the savory hearty flavor and texture. My date's mesquite grilled brochette's were "oK', I think because it wasn't very different than many meals we eat. Prices are on higher side. Noise was subdued despite large space and large number of diners and we carried on normal conversation. Overall, a fine experience and we'll return.

This is our second time at Greens (the first being 19 years ago) and we weren't disappointed. The location is fabulous with views over Crissy Field and the Golden Gate Bridge. You can even watch seals swim in the marina while you eat. The restaurant serves imaginative vegetarian food which would please even meat eaters like ourselves. Portions were good and not excessive as in some US restaurants. The wine list was varied as was the dessert selection.

Spacious and airy locale with excellent food. One self-professed "meat eater" loved all the vegetarian offerings. Professional waiter who was "just right". The only negative aspect was the bill but this was expected and easily overlooked after the superb food(and wine).

This is one of San Francisco's classic restaurants with an amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge (bring your sunglasses). Many people are put off by the fact that this is a vegetarian restaurant (one of the grand dames of that field that helped revolutionize dining in the 1970s).I promise that you will leave full with wonderful tastes to savor. It's incredibly inventive food packed with flavor - and it just happens to be good for you.We visited for brunch. Split the banana bread with walnut butter - and I followed with the Pinnacles Scramble - eggs, potatoes, chilis, black beans, creme fraiche, tomato and pumpkin seed salsa. Delicious and a bit spicy.

Over the years, I've eaten at this restaurant when visiting the city a few times. I was very excited to introduce it to me vegan daughter on her birthday trip to the city.Sadly, I felt our meal & service were lacklustre. It pains me to say, but this classic needs a little revamp - including the menu. We had eaten at other vegetarian/vegan restaurants earlier in this trip - and comparably, this was the least favourite. The food is good, but not exciting and slightly underseasoned - there is no salt on the table. The service was painful - having to ask for water, bread and a 30-minute wait between first and second course - not really acceptable when you're at this level. The view and location are wonderful of course.It should also be noted, this was the most expensive meal of our vegan tour in SF. I'm happy to pay these prices, but I want the service and I want the offerings that go with it. I guess I'm over it.

We eat vegetarian at home, but usually not when traveling. Greens Restaurant is an exception. This is where we go for consistently good and complex vegetarian dishes when in San Francisco. It always inspires me to be more creative in my cooking when returning home. Our dinner last weekend was delicious and satisfying. Go before sunset to enjoy the views out on the Bay. Also, an interesting bar has opened next door and works nicely for an after dinner drink.

My go to for delicious vegetarian and for brunch
Rating: 4

My parents first took me to Greens when I was probably around eight years old (lucky I know). Since then I learned that the restaurant and its founders really began the farm to table movement in the bay area and the push for vegetarianism, showing again and again that vegetarian can be delicious too. Although I am not myself vegetarian, I have a special appreciation for this restaurants part in emphasizing the importance of local, healthy eating. Brunch at greens is one of my favorite brunches in the city. We always get buttermilk biscuits and cornbread to start (or one of their delicious scones). I usually get the pupusas but the scramble and pancakes (when available) are favorites too. Brunch is more affordable if you want to be fancy but aren't quite ready to shell out for dinner- and during the daylight there are beautiful views of the harbor, the bay and the Golden Gate bridge. At dinner if you can catch the sunset it will be worth it, and the earlier you go the less people will be there so it's a bit quieter. I took my boyfriend here for our first year together and we had a lovely meal and it was very romantic, the ideal anniversary. The service is always fantastic, the ambiance is light with big west facing windows, the restaurant is classy but comfortable and the food is always delicious. The space is large enough to accommodate large parties and they have a back room that can be rented. It is good for families, dates, business, friends, or even by yourself. One of our favorite things to do is come here and then stop by the Interval next door for drinks, or if it is for brunch you can go for a lovely walk along the marina and down to Crissy Field to work off your meal. If you have not been, go. If you are trying to impress family, friends, a date or for a business meeting this is the place (unless your boss is a meat lover).

One of the best restaurants in San Francisco!For vegetarians and anyone interested in excellent food with the best possible and freshest ingredients prepared imaginatively, this restaurant is for you. Non-vegetarians will not be disappointed as the selection of dishes offers a wealth of possibilities. Presentation is gorgeous and service outstanding. The location at Fort Mason is convenient and makes for easy parking. The restaurant is very attractive and the views are magnificent. We had dinner and look forward to eating there again soon. It's a jewel, and, in my opinion, one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.

We visited Greens on a Friday night and it was certainly busy, which gave it a lively atmosphere but meant that we had to wait for a while before our booked table became free. I found the food unremarkable, hence my disappointment. In my experience, up-market vegetarian restaurants are characterised by an inventive flair in their cooking but this was sadly lacking in the meal we had. Given the prices they charge, I'd have expected better.

Greens Restaurant offers vegan and vegetarian cuisine using organic and seasonal produce. To be clear, the food is good albeit not the most interesting and not the most gourmet-ish. The location is a little remote, but it offers stellar views of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. The interior space is interesting and Zen-like, showcasing a number of woods crafted in the Japanese style of joinery- no nails were used. When making a reservation, ask to sit by the window. They also have a cookbook- I own one. If you have the time, it's worth a visit. It is a historic icon.

I was so looking forward to visiting this vegetarian restaurant as though not fully vegetarian I often find the veggie restaurants are much more experimental with their food. However, this was not the case with Greens who were full to the brim when we visited and we had to wait 15 minutes or so for our table. Nothing wrong there, but sadly the food was just okay, nothing special, fairly old style veggie with lots of hummus, and veggie spring rolls. Surely in California veggie restaurants have moved on from this style of food, if not they could learn a lesson or two from Avant Garden in New York.I would suggest that this restaurant is not worth the reputation it has, and as it's expensive for veggie food, don't waste your money.

Everything we tasted - and we ordered big so that we could try a lot of things - was delicious. The fig-burrata appetizer was quite good - the bread served with it was quite something (which it didn't have to be). The quinoa / cauliflower cakes were tremendous. The curry had an excellent flavor and was certainly enough for two. The brouchettes were quite nice and hearty. We did not save room for dessert but those around us seemed to be enjoying theirs quite a bit. The tables are close together so romance might be not the thing here but between the ambiance, vistas, and food treasures, this place is a great spot for vegetarians and their friends.

Greens has just taken its place as the best high end vegetarian restaurant on the planet. The staff are all fantastic. The location is amazing. The room, especially the "heavy tables", is beyond compare. The food is excellent, obviously prepared and served with care and attention. Truly a wonderful, exceptional experience. Eating healthy has never been better. I could not recommend Greens too highly.
