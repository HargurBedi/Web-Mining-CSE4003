Inside next to the Restaurant is their soft ice cream stand with six or so flavors. No need to go inside just stand in line. Two busy people pump out cones and cups at a fast pace. Nothing special or unique just soft ice cream. Enjoy outside with view of bay and bridge.

There are usually lines. Suck it up. The burger options are classic and the quality of the beef and accompaniments is hard to match. Get the onion rings, they never disappoint. The place serves great wines to boot, Turley and Schaefer without substantial markup. Casual elegance al fresco.

I stopped in for dinner on my last night in town and had the best turkey burger ever! I don't eat red meat so I've had more turkey burgers than I can count. This one was by far the very best. Juicy, well seasoned and flame grilled. Locally baked egg role and mayo were also fantastic.There was a bit of a line but it moved quickly and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.My only regret is that I didn't stop here earlier in my stay.

I've eaten at other Gott's and thought the burgers were fantastic. Thus, I was disappointed with the cheeseburger; there simply was nothing compelling about it. The bun didn't seem fresh; it was a bit hard throughout. The sandwich was rather sloppily prepared, with the sauce and garnishes off to one side of the sandwich leaving nothing but bread and meat for a few bites. I really wanted to like the food and sorry I didn't. The fries were okay. I had a strawberry shake and it also was not very notable; there simply wasn't much strawberry taste to it. I guess I'll have to go to the other locations in the Napa Valley for a good version of their burger. I will say that their staff were friendly and cheerful.

The burgers and salads were fresh and the restaurant itself was clean with a great ambiance. The price is relative to what we received so all round we were happy. We will be back next time we are in SF!

We went there on a sunny Friday around 130 pm and the line was almost to the street. I realize it's a popular place and it was a nice day, but we probably waited about a half hour (fifteen in line and fifteen to get our order), which I think is too long. Food is good, but not gourmet.

This space is really busy - we stood in line to get food and then they make it for you fresh - but not a lot of seating inside in the AC space. We were there when it was really hot outside, so sitting outside in the sun was not a good option. Burgers are between 12 and 14 dollars, fries are 4.00 but they sell bottles/glasses of wine and beer by the glass. Shakes are good. If you are willing to stand outside the food space, you can get soft serve.

Gott's occupies prime real estate in the Ferry Building and could probably do well just serving ordinary food to tourists but that's not what they're about. Gott's was born as Taylor's Automatic Refresher just outside of Napa which still exists as a Gott's as does the Gott's in Napa beside the Oxbow Market.There's always a line and the food is cooked to order so you are going to wait. Unquestionably the best burger spot wine list in America. The burgers are great here but so is everything else. Last visit I had a crabmeat sandwich on sourdough that was outstanding. This time around we both had salads. Spouse had a kale and apple Caesar and I had an Asian salad that was excellent. Way more food than I could eat and it doubled as my dinner that night. Always check out the specials because they hide some great food there.

I only had a drink but this is a full grill and what is different for an airport is that it is done in front of you and there is such a line at times that they gave you a buzzer to pick up your food. Compared to other places in the airport, the prices seemed reasonable. They had quick grab and go items such as gourmet sandwiches and a protein pack which consisted of nuts, cheese and one other item. The soda was good because I had free refills. I saw a lot of food and it looked good. The egg buns looked incredible.

We shared garlic fries, which were just okay. We sat outside, and it was good for people watching.

Salads 101: Tear the Lettuces Apart and Soak the Leaves in a Basin of Water Before Washing Under Running Water
Rating: 3
Date: July 16, 2017
Salads 101: tear lettuces apart, leaf by leaf, and soak all the leaves in large basin of running water, swishing the leaves about to allow grit to fall to the bottom of the basin before rinsing the leaves under running water. The Cobb salad I had today at Gott's had unfortunately not been prepared with this care, and every bite was a dismaying experience of crunching down on grit. No amount of good dressing and good ingredients can make a salad palatable, when this basic rule is ignored.I've eaten at Gott's several times at St. Helena, and have enjoyed other salads, sandwiches, and fish tacos there that were well-prepared, though I haven't found the folks who take food orders at the Napa Valley location always courteous, and I once wrote the Gott's management about this. To their credit, they responded to my complaint. I can't say the staff at Gott's in the San Francisco Ferry Market location were conspicuously pleasant today, either, but I'll acknowledge that it must take a lot of energy to take order after order on a busy, hot summer evening like this evening and remain pleasant. My main beef about today's dinner: the grit. In the salad. Due to improper washing of the lettuce.This is easy to remediate. And it should not be happening in any restaurant, let alone one in San Francsico, which prides itself on its food culture.

Burgers are made to order and quality. The patties are tender, and cooked to medium well. The buns are above average, but could be toasted a bit more for my tastes. Toppings are spot on. Fries are good but I like mine crunchier. Tried garlic and herb fries, which were soggy and the herbs were slightly overpowering due to their freshness. The sweet potato fries I am told were very good but not super crunchy. Chicken tenders seem hand made and we're very good. Menu is small, but they cook every order to perfection. We attended twice and the quality was consistent.

Have eaten here over the years and it was always good. This time not so much. Service was fast & friendly and that is where the good ends. The hamburger had no taste, pretty bland, the bun was cold , hard and tasted stale. French fries were bland, mushy no flavor,. The last time someplace changed the oil they fry the food in to a healthier option. It goes without saying , if I wanted healthy , I would not be eating fries!

It was never my first choice, but it has always been a success. The line is always daunting on a beautiful afternoon, and this place is clearly a tourist trap. Yet, it works. The line moves quickly, and somehow there is always seating outside for a group of 4, even though it looks like there won't be any.I've always been happy with my burger, as have my companions, which is why we keep ending up there. I got the kimchi burger this time and it was fantastic - one of the best burgers I've ever had. The service is always friendly, even though it's not obvious that these folks are jonesing for tips.It's not cheap, at $12 for a burger and $6 for a pint of good beer. But listening to local musicians on the nearby sidewalk, or having the protest du jour march go by always makes for good ambience.

This is one of our trusted favorites while in SF. We used to make the drive to Napa to eat at their roadside restaurant. The food is good every time. And we tried out their organic Strauss ice cream this time as well. Two thumbs up for everything they serve here. Especially the burgers. 

One of the best

The reviews and rankings don't lie. This is one of the best burgers in town! We had the blue cheese and the turkey burger special. Both were excellent. Service is excllent, menu is also excellent. They have wines and beers too and you can dine outside while people watching. Location is also excellent. Everything is excellent! Need I say more?

Best burger spot in the City!

Gott's is a great place to go for a quick, simple meal with great atmosphere. This is our go-to place when we're going to a Giants game with the family or shopping at the Farmers' Market. The burgers and garlic fries are awesome, but the salads are great too. It's counter style with very quick service and a great location in the front of the Ferry Building.

Spicy Tomato Soup and a Milkshake

I was in San Francisco a couple weeks back on a business trip. The folks I was with wanted to head down to the Ferry Terminal to grab some dinner at Gotts. I hadn't been before, so I said I'm in.I wasn't terribly hungry so I opted for the spicy tomato soup and decided to try one of their milkshakes. Both were delicious. The soup had just the right amount of spice to it and the milkshake was rich yet drinkable. I'm looking forward to going back to Gotts the next time I'm in town. I have a feeling it will become one of my new must-do's when in town.

Great experience

Great food, service, location. Outdoor seating allows further enjoyment of the San Francisco experience. Overall a good choice.

You'll hear about In N Out (which I love); however, this is where you should stop. The location is fantastic and you get extremely fresh ingredients cooked exceptionally well. The beer and wine list are fantastic and Humphry Slocombe is next door. One of the best value meals in the area with a great seating area to watch passing walkers.

Despite the red-and-white linoleum feel of its interior, Gott's Roadside is not really a "roadside" diner. On one side is the Embarcadero, with its roaring traffic flow, and the historic Ferry Building and ferry docks on the other. Their outdoor seating is perfect for people-watching and "train-spotting" the old trolleys lumbering by.Decent food & prices, cold beer. I could've used a little more "fish" and a little less "chips" in my Fish & Chips, but the fish was tasty. My pal had the ahi and devoured it quickly. Our outdoor table was wobbly & sticky. Still, Gott's Roadside is a fun dining experience.

Good burgers!

My wife and I really enjoyed the burgers. Not the best we've ever had, but in the top 3! Fun location down at the wharf. Would have loved to try the true "roadside" one in Napa a few days earlier, but couldn't get there.

Fun place to visit.

Everyone seemed to really enjoy their burgers. Would eat there again. Loved the location as it was nice to sit outside and eat. They have good kids menu and specials for the day worth trying as they are seasonal specials. Food was very fresh and for as busy as they were, service at the counter was nice and attentive. Note, we did order the kids corn dogs and it was essentially one hot dog cut up into bite size pieces for $7. Good but not exactly what we expected, esp for the price. Their adult hot dog was good and a nice full size. :)

Good food

This is a good place for burgers, hot dogs, and salads. They serve beer and wine with outside seating. Usually very busy but it is very well run and the staff are very efficient.

Ahi Tuna and PBR

The transition from Taylor's to Gott's hasn't slowed this place down or reduced the quality of food. My most recent visit resulted in an Ahi Tuna Burger, Onion Rings, and a bucket of PBR.The view is also worth the stop.

Very better burgers
