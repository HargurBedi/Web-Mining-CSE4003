Staying at SF a few days and walking through china town one morning we decided to have 'breakfast' here. It was nearly 11 am really so in fact considered as a 'brunch'. My son's wife is Chinese so we were in good hands. She made multiple choices for us. It was pretty obvious as well that the indigenous Chinese people eat there as well....always a good sign. Very authentic decor. So easy to spend $120, but worth it.

Always fun, high energy and especially a great time introducing friends to their first dim sum experience. The delivery is fast & furious and you must stay alert if you don't want a delectable to pass you by. We were eight friends and six had never eaten dim sum or had this experience. What fun introducing them. The duck is heavenly, but beware the bun will fill you up. Good food, more selections than you can eat and for eight friends drinking tea, bill was $350.

Went to Yank Sing at a friend's recommendation while visiting San Fran and was definitely not disappointed. The food was absolutely amazing service was fast and the staff was super friendly. It is slightly in the expensive side, but was totally worth it. The soup filled dumplings and shrimp tossed in some light creme sauce we're the highlights of the meal. Would definitely return.

I went to Yank Sing from Santa Fe with recommendations from friends who had lived there before. I went by myself on a Sunday afternoon. I ordered too much food, but it made for great leftovers. I was trying to stay healthy, and I was concerned about the breading. I had the best red cabbage with jicama and glazed walnuts. I also had the best cooked eggplant. The chicken and mushroom dumpling was amazing. The curried chicken turnover was very rich and filling. I could have ordered so many more dumplings on another day. It is good to go with other people to share in the varieties, and it is best to go early. I arrived late in the afternoon, and they had run out of the Peking duck.

Excellent as usual but the value is going down

I first ate at Yank Sing in the 80s and have always come back for more. However these days, the prices are a bit over the top for what you get. Perfect pork buns, delicious shrimp shu mai, tremendous Peking duck, all are hallmarks of Yank Sing Dim Sum. I was there is week for lunch after going to the MoMA and it was very nice, very crowded and very busy and loud. The trollies with the goodies arrive very frequently and with endless tea a very nice meal. At $50 per person, good for business folks but not so much for people like me. Don't get me wrong this remains one of my very favorite places, just a little let down this time.

Going for dim sum can always be a hectic experience, but once you settle into a table at Yank Sing, you get right down to business. Carts come by frequently, servers are attentive with refreshing tea pots. The dim sum is delicious, refined and distinct flavors. Different from East Coast dim sum, which is good and has a more rustic character. I love them both. The place is bustling and can be a bit noisy, though if you are seated in the court of the center, those who are hard of hearing may have some difficulty with sound.

My Husband and I always make it a point to stop in every time we are in the San Francisco area. A very interesting Fusion of the traditional Chinese dim sum, with a modern twist to many of their dishes. Yet they keep it as close to authentic as possible. Great service & pretty inexpensive - unless you eat everything that comes by on the carts! Highly recommend this place to everyone we know.

First time being in a restaurant where the dim sum carts and other food carts go pass you. Needed someone to explain the process, it was over whelming. We had not been more than 2 minutes at the table when food carts hit us like crazy. Pace your self there is so much food to sample and enough to share. The dim sum was good, the guys keep ordering that and the the duck steam buns was a hit. The different types of fried food was interesting, the shrimp, stuff crab, etc. Like I said pace your self. The atmosphere inside is loud, so if you want a more open sitting ask to sit outside in the center by the water feature.

Simply a great experience. If you like Dim Sum and Chinese food in general, then this is a place not to miss. It's really like in Hong Kong.

We wanted to try a Chinese restaurant in SF and read this was number 1 in Tripadvisor but also read it was expensive. The quality is amazing. Waiters pass around with trolleys and you pick up the food you like (we liked that! It's very visual). The best was shrimp dumplings (delicious!). We ordered 5 dishes + jasmine tea (highly advisable) and two egg custard little tarts (hot and creamy). All of that for just 67$ (the night before we had small pizzas in a regular restaurant with two beers for 40$!). I strongly recommend this place. The atmosphere is chic and relaxed in spite of being a very popular place. Btw, we waited 15 mins to be seated.

This place gets crowded quickly so get there early. Once you've eaten there, you'll know why it's so popular. Authentic Dim Sum and attentive service in a casual atmosphere. There's seating inside and in the atrium at Rincon Center so it feels like an open space even when it's crowded. All of the usual offerings you would expect and many options to choose from. Prices are a little high, but still a very good experience.

Although the Rincon Center felt a little deserted on a Saturday afternoon (2:45p), metered street parking was available and the bustling Ferry Center Bldg. was just a block away and across the street (I.e. Easy to enjoy both). Our party of 3 made reservations a couple hours ahead on open table and we were quickly seated as soon as we arrived. We enjoyed all the fresh dim sum dishes we were wanting and the only dish we didn't see on the carts was pork bao, which we ordered and was quickly brought to out table. Although they close at 4p and some of the waiters were cleaning and prepping for closing (in another area), we did not feel rushed, lingered to finish our tea and slowly made our way out around 4p. I like the atmosphere at the Stevenson location a little better with the large windows, but I would still make a point to come to one of the two locations for dim sum on my next trip to SF!

I went to this restaurant after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. I must say that I was extremely disappointed. This place is an americanized version of dim sum without many of the authentic dishes. We had Ha Gow, pork sui mai which were good, but the chow fun was made with ground beef instead of sliced beef and the sweet soy sauce was poor. Our favorite dishes (chicken feet, shrimp ball and beef tripe) were not even available.We had three adults and three teens and not even being full our bill was $170!!!

Yank sing has been a favourite of ours over a few visits to San Francisco and did not disappoint again for my wife's birthday.

This is a beautiful place, off the beaten track for dim sum. Our friend, a connoisseur of dim sum, was somewhat disappointed. He felt that it wasn't as good as the first time he'd been there several years ago. The sea bass, however, was excellent and our favorite of the ten dishes we tried. The steamed items were predictable, even their "house specialty" though, learning how to prepare it was interesting. The wait staff was quite friendly and helpful. We never were able to get really hot tea even though we asked for it. We never saw the dessert cart. For the three of us, the bill was $122 pre-tip. Ladies, there's only one toilet...be prepared to use the men's room!

THis large restaurant is always busy. We visietd with a larsger group for early lunch and it was a mad house. All good dim sum places are loud, and this one is top 10 in noise. The selection is just as wide as advertised. Lots of goodies. The quality was good with some excellent choices. The rice pasta with beef was great. So were the sweet buns with pork. They claimed to be short of wait staff so the service suffered badly. The prices were a little higher than normal but probably worth it.

This was our first time trying Dim Sum and Yank Sing was recommended by a few friends some of which live in San Francisco so I figured it had to be good. Going by some of the reviews here stating that it gets crowded and there are lines of people, we went right at opening, 10am. We were first in the door and two other parties behind us. Within 30 minutes, the place was packed. The experience - I was a little nervous about ordering because of the reviews, but there were no problems. The first waiter came and took our drink orders. We told him it was our first time and he explained everything. When the carts came around, the servers described what they had and we picked what we wanted. If someone came around with something we didn't want, we politely declined. Now for the food - I was blown away! We had the stuffed crab claws and shrimp dumplings to start. We then had the spring rolls which our server cut in half to make bite sized. The spring rolls were a bit on the greasy side for me, but my husband loved them. Two must haves, the Shanghai soup dumpling and the Peking Duck. The duck was not on the menu so we asked a server and they brought it out to us, crispy skin and moist meat with all the toppings with a steamed bun, SO good! The soup dumpling was fabulous to say the least and I liked that the server showed us how to eat it, nice touch! It was a bit pricey which we expected so not very shocked when we received our check, but it was so very worth the price. As they say, you get what you pay for and we left very fully and happy!

I have been going to Yank Sing for dim sum for a very long time. The food is always extremely fresh and very tasty. There is a large variety of dim sum choices but some of my favorites are breaded and deep fried crab claws, steamed or baked pork buns, lettuce wraps and sesame balls. This restaurant has many followers so it's a good idea to make a reservation. The restaurant is located in an office building and there is parking in the basement. Parking is validated so remember to take your parking ticket to the restaurant with you and remember to have it stamped for validation.

Our Dim Sum favorite place in SF, but it is pricey. We've eaten at both locations and the food is excellent.

But it is a wonderful dining experience, and the food is fabulous. The soup dumpling are outstanding. The Rincon Annex location is easier as you can park underneath, probably could park there and walk to the other location (weather permitting - it was raining when we went).

My wife and I read about this place in the Westways magazine and decided to give it a try while visiting San Francisco. We have tried many places in Chinatown with mixed results. This restaurant is located in the Rincon Center in the atrium portion of the center. There is ample seating and the parking is either validated by Yank Sing or complimentary depending on the day of the week that you visit. We went on a Sunday and the place was packed so I suggest you make reservations whenever you go to be sure you get seated promptly. (There was a long line of folks waiting without reservations however, we were seated within a couple of minutes.) Yes, it can be pricey if you don't pay attention to the food items you accept. You need to be mindful of what you are accepting and how many dishes you have tried. There are only two negatives for this place. One, like most dim sum restaurants, many of the cart servers did not understand English and it was somewhat difficult to ascertain what was in the items being offered (i.e., fish, pork, chicken, beef, etc.). Second, the parking at this location is very cramped and it can be very difficult to park a large or longer vehicle. We had a four door compact rental car and it was a very tight fit for us to get in and out of the parking area. We have tried many dim sum restaurants around the U.S. and this is definitely one of the if not the best there is. The service was very good and attentive, and the food quality was the best. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the San Francisco area.

We enjoyed a tasty but expensive lunch before a play one Sunday. Be prepared it is VERY crowded ona Sunday. We had a reservation and were seated on time. There is a lengthy list of the dim sum options on the table...but when they whiz by with those ittle carts you have no idea what you will be paying for each little plate you point to. We asked a couple beside us for advice on what we should try. They gave us some tips on what to try and what to avoid. We enjoyed everything we ordered but even by eating with caution and no alcohol lunch was $86. Just be prepared to open your wallet but enjoy it for the tasty treat for the experience it is.

Fairly extensive selection of traditional dim sum dishes. Most were quite good. Didn't offer white vinegar, which was a disappointment. The BBQ siaopao were a special treat. Attentive service - when we sat for a while waiting, a manager came to ask what we would like and followed up to make sure we got it. A bit pricy. They validate parking (we didn't use it) which is nice. The Rincon Center is worth a visit by itself.

We came here for lunch with a few friends while visiting in San Francisco. A friend had recommended we try it. The place was hopping, but we had made a reservation in advance. The food was excellent. Funny though, I had not ever experienced true Dim Sum before. We were seated, and immediately barraged by servers and carts full of food. Heavy accents, and a little pushy, practically putting the plates on the table before we had a chance to say OK. there were no prices listed, and with the servers being so hard to understand, we had no idea how much $$ we were going to end up spending. The process was stressful to be honest.Once the table was brimming with delicacies, things calmed down and we really enjoyed the food. It was then that we looked around and learned from other patrons. Apparently it is okay to say No :-). I realize this was "our bad," and we just didn't know the ropes. Advice to those going to Dim Sum for the first time - it's okay to say No, or Not right now. We will definitely go back to this restaurant when we return to SF. Now that we understand how it works!

Not a lot of dim sum places are still using carts, and Yank Sing clings to this tradition to complete an old-school experience. The service staff, thankfully, don't cling to the tradition of being rude or disinterested; the team here are very nice.Not much to say about the space: it's a typical dim sum restaurant, tending towards the upper end.I was told early on in my dim sum-eating career that a restaurant should be judged by its har gow. It's a simple dish, but fiendishly difficult to execute very well. Yank Sing's har gow are OK. The rice skins were a bit thicker and tackier than I'd like, and the prawns not quite as flavourful as they could be, but they were good. Two standout dishes which, ironically, are not dim sum, are the Sichuan chicken which was amazing. And their Xiao Long Bao which technically are Shanghainese, were very well executed.

What a great place for Chinese food and dim sum . Large and well lighted room but get there early because the lines form quickly . Long wait by the time we were leaving . Service was excellent with servers with carts passing by all of the time , you could even ask for something they did not have on the cart , and they would make a call and in minutes it was your table . The food in general was very good but the dumplings were excellent !!! My only comment is that if you do not pay attention , the price skyrockets quickly . We will certainly be returning .

I've been hear a lot as it's near my work, and I have to say that Yank Sing is pretty consistent with it's food. You can always count on the food to roll in as soon as you sit down - so be sure to pace yourself. Order some tea and point to some quick bites you want off the bat - then wait for the many, many options with which you'll be presented.How much does it cost? You'll never know until the end because each time you pick something, you'll get an undistinguishable mark on your tab. After years of going, I still don't know how their system works. But I do know it's good.Going with a group gives you the option to try many different things. Save room for the sesame balls and egg custard buns (you might have to ask for those special).Good stuff - and quite the experience for those who have had the pleasure.

While we went to SF for a wonderful beer festival, a visit to Yank Sing was also in our sights. The festival was lots of fun and we had some truly spectacular beers. And the food didn't disappoint us.

A highlight of my stay in San Francisco. Go!

Drove up from Santa Cruz for a day of meseums and food. 1st sto pool yank sing and although the place was packed we fortunately got seated right away at a little two seat table. Within 5 minutes the first cart came by and we started picking which baskets we wanted. Grabbed 5! Then 5 mins later a different assortment of dim sum cart dropped by, two more baskets, then another yet different assortment cart came by. My honey and I looked at each other with long faces and decided we ate enough. She did have another mimosa though. Really was a treat and next time we'll pace ourselves so we can sample the various types of carts of dim sum.

I am so happy that we found Yank Sing! On a recent business trip to San Francisco my colleague and I both wanted dim sum -- Yank Sing was the perfect spot. The dim sum was simply delicious. The offerings were plentiful and it was hard to not order everything -- it all looked, smelled and tasted delicious. The service was helpful and relaxing. After eating we sat and drank tea for quite a while. I'll be back the next time I'm in San Francisco.

A trip to San Francisco would not be complete without a visit to Yank Sing. It has the best Dim Sum in the States that we know of. In addition to all of our tasty favorites - especially the seafood, shrimp and vegetable dumplings - they have a great cabbage and walnut salad, and a green chinese vegetable of the day which combine so well with everything. We have been coming to Yank Sing for the last 15 years every time our travels take us from Pennsylvania to the Bay area. It never disappoints. The quality and delicious flavors of the Yank Sing Dim Sum remain the best for us!

Great for our large group of 3 adults and 6 teens. Something for everyone served very quickly. Very tasty, traditional dumplings. We are spoiled for dumplings in Sydney but these were very well received by the Australian teens who had been travelling for a month. The US teens loved them as well. Staff very patient with our hideous pronunciation of the Cantonese names. Not the cheapest yum cha but the setting is lovely and very clean and you don't feel packed in like a sardine.

We like to take friends and family here for special occasions or if it's just my hubby and I. Kids are totally welcomed here and there's plenty of seating outside the restaurant also. I believe they open at 10 am on the weekends. The dim sum is very good here and the service is good. The pork dim sum and the skinny soy sauce noodles are the bomb! It's very expensive but it's for the experience. The restroom is small so use the restroom outside in the mall.

Delicious sojourn into well made dim sum

I was so excited after I found Yank Sing online andI read a descriptive list of some of the special dim sum here! We arrived without reservations and were relieved when they graciously found us a table for two on New Year's Eve daytime . I recommend going with at least a list of what sounds good in your head. Otherwise the carts will start to arrive and you will be tempted by things that weren't on your wish list. It was good to discipline ourselves so we got some of the more unusual dumplings. We really appreciated the mushroom dumplings as well as the snow pea shoot ones as well, which were packed with fresh shoots-so refreshing. The Shanghai soup dumplings were beautifully prepared and presented with soup spoons and red vinegar with fresh ginger.Shrimp shu mai (mye) was generously packed with shrimp and also quite flavorful. We very much enjoyed the minced chicken served in lettuce cups with hoisin sauce, pine nuts, and I think cilantro-tho that sounds strange. An order of snap peas balanced the dumplings and a pot of tea was delicious. The only dumplings which were not inspirational were the pork pot stickers. Their coverings were too thick and the filling just average.The meal seemed fairly priced to us for the lovely Rincon Building setting and the helpful service. Fir example, since I had a list of what I wanted to try, they called in our "order" and soon the dishes arrived!I would call ahead.

We love Yank Sing and have been coming for a decade. The soup dumplings are heaven. My kids love them too and we love Sam! He is such a great server and so sweet! First and last stop every time we visit the city!

Super clean, yummy food, and superb service. I'd say like 5 star hotel like service. To be honest, this dim sum spot stands out to me because the excellent food is matched with awesome service.

Often go here for dim sum with the family, the kids love the food here, especially the pork buns. But the best thing on the menu is the Peking duck, lovely slices of duck, cucumber, spring onions and sweet hoisin sauce.

Average and pricey dim sum

If you want average and pricey dim sum, this is your place. We had a reservation and was seated out in the atrium. Carts moved around the tables and served lukewarm dim sum. The har gow was ok while the shu mai was a bit small and not very appealing. The xiao long bao had a thick skin but was at least juicy on the inside. Other dim sum like the beancurd roll and the rice noodle roll was also lukewarm and average in quality. Save your money and go down to Chinatown for better quality dim sum and it is also cheaper too.

Be prepared for a borage of dumpling and other fine Chinese specialties. Form the moment we were seated cart after cart of delicious offerings were presented to us in small plates. One can eat until their heart is content. Fun, unusual, delicious, you'd have to go to Hong Kong to enjoy anything close to this.

Not as good as it was?

Well, it's still Yank Sing -- huge room, noise, barrage of carts and incomprehensible descriptions, plentiful offerings and all of them tasty. But is it us or the restaurant changing over time? We had a good meal, but somehow the flavors just didn't seem as interesting as they had in our prior visits. I might attribute it to aging taste buds, but the next day we had a much better dim sum at literally half the price at City View, Hmm.

Best dim sum ever!

Pricey but worth it. I love dim sum and this was the best, freshest and most favorable I've had. Very large space that overflows into the atrium and was full both times I went. Enjoy!

This place has excellent dim sum. The selections are brought on carts or offered by waitresses carrying some of the other options. Everything we had was very good. The selection is varied and it's great to go with a group to be able to try many different things. If you go on a weekend be sure to have a reservation. Parking is free on the weekends but the garage can also be crowded with parking spaces limited. The Shanghai soup dumplings are a specialty and are delicious. They serve things like Peking duck and sea bass. Be prepared for a large bill. This dim sum is very expensive. They serve wine and other drinks in addition to tea and that can make your bill even higher. It's worth the splurge every now and then to have dim sum here!

I rarely give out 5 stars. However, Yank Sing is definitely the best Dim Sum you will ever eat. What makes it so special is that is all home made. The dim sum is not greasy or heavy in any way. you definitely get what you pay for.

Two Tales of Dim Sum in San Francisco

A legendary dim sum purveyor, this restaurant has 2 locations. We normally head to Stevenson Street for weekend lunch, but decided to try Rincon Center recently. A mistake-crowded, loud, harried wait staff, limited selection - they ran out of Peking Duck! The only saving grace was validated parking. I will go back to Stevenson for their courtesy, attention to the customer and because they are not just trying to get people in and out, a much more enjoyable experience - at $50/ person average, something to consider. Reservation can be made on their website (not OpenTable) and they are only open until 4 pm. on the weekends. Go early!

We have been enjoying the Chinese food in San Francisco for a few days now. Although tasty, not very authentic. The Yank Sing was very different. Traditional Cantonese at its best. Complete with trolleys . As good as we have tasted anywhere including Hong Kong and the UK where first generation Chinese cooking is very readily available. We are well and ended with a bill around $100 for 2 including drinks. Good ambiance & attractive decor. Would definitely return.

I'll admit, I haven't yet been to Hong Kong and had the real thing, but I have been to Dim Sum in many cities around the world, and this is the best I've ever had. The soup dumplings are probably the star of the show, but really everything we had was great. Service was very friendly and quick, and they don't waste any time, as soon as you sit down, the food starts coming. Would definitely go back.

We had messed up our reservation (beware there are 2 Yank Sing's near each other, so half our party was at the other one!). But I think the staff must be used to it, and they fixed it with no problem, despite midday on a Saturday being there busiest time.The food is just the best, brought to you on a constant flotilla of trollies. You take what you like the look of, and they stamp your card which you take to the till afterwards. We had crab, prawn dumplings, lots of vegetable dim sum. I don't eat meat, but apparently the soup dumplings and duck are bliss.The dessert is minimal but the sweet sesame dumplings are yummy

We were recommended this restaurant from our hotel. We thought it was odd that the restaurant was in an office type complex. The place was extremely busy, but we got seated right away. As soon as we sat down here came the food. There was so much to choose from. Of course we ordered too much food. About the food...DELICIOUS!! Besides Hong Kong, this is the best dim sum we have ever had. We are sorry we don't live in SF to come here more often. The service was also excellent. We are now thinking of an excuse to come back to SF just to go to this restaurant.

I went here for a business lunch and was very impressed. The restaurant feels traditionally Chinese. First there is a choice of tea. Good sign for me. Then the carts start coming around with steaming baskets of goodies. The rice noodle with pork was excellent. Very good Xiao Long Bao with a fragrant ginger infused soup. The food is moving quickly so you have time to wait and enjoy. No need to hurry at all. The restaurant is very popular so it may be worth booking ahead for lunch.

Wow.

In never really figured out Dim Sum, and we went here with a party of nine and ordered pretty much everything. The only rules we gave ourselves was no fried dishes because the steamed dumplings were less filling and allowed you can taste the subtle flavors better. Everything was good. And clean. And the service was great. We tried dish after dish after dish. The best dumplings were the Shanghai Dumplings - pork filled with soup. And then probably the shrimp. It was a lot of fun with nine people because we basically got to try and share everything.

Another terrific concierge recommendation. Location was great for us, as we were going to the MOMA, about 15 minutes down the street, This is far different than Chinatown dim sum. Very upscale location in a corporate office locale. Broadest dim sum menu we've encountered. Very good service. One reason is that all the cart servers are all connected to the kitchen via headsets. That's why when we wanted a half order of potstickers (with unique, savory filling), the plate came within seconds. Other highlights included Peking duck on a bun. A helfty $6.75 a slice but a wonderful indulgence. Curry savory vegetable dumplings were also very good. Snow pea shoot dumplings are supposed to be one of their specialties. Found the filling of greens to be undifferentiated. Could have been any leafy green vegetable. Wound up spending more than twice as much as we've ever spent for dim sum but well worth.

The staff was as wonderful as the food. Edgar was lovely and very helpful. he made our meal an enjoyable and unforgetable experience. We went on a Sunday around noon. The place was packed and they have dozens of tables in the atrium. This restaurant is in the financial district, not China Town, but the customers were largely Asian, so you know it must be good. It is pricey, however.
