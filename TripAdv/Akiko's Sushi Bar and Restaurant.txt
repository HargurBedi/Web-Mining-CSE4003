Sushi was ok; not great. I was shocked when I received my bill as I wasn't full and didn't eat a lot. Alos, I did not order any alcohol. Restaurant is small: 4 stools at sushi bar that are very close together, probably only 3 normal sized people could sit comfortably and about 4 small tables. If you have to use the rest room, you have to go outside, down in to the basement and well, some ladies may not be thrilled at this. If you are a sushi purist: you want your sushi chef to be Japanese: this is not the place for you as the waitress was talking Korean to the young sushi chef.

We visited Akiko for dinner on the advice of reviews on Trip Advisor. We are glad we did. Very small place - seating for just 16, including the sushi bar. Very nice people. Owner/chef (we think) was very friendly and recommended certain types of fish, including providing a free sample of buttery-textured bluefin tuna (toro). All of the sushi we tried was excellent and prices were about what we expected. Local patrons stopped in for take-out while we were dining. Would dine here again.

We came here for dinner one night while visiting SF. As mentioned in other reviews, this restaurant is tiny. Not sure whether there's usually a line but we came here on a Wed. evening around 6pm and there was no one there so we were seated immediately by the window. We ordered some rolls and sashimi. It's not over the top amazing (we've had better sushi in NYC) but still everything was fresh and portions were not skimpy. The green tea was very good and piping hot which is always very nice. The only I would suggest is the height of the tables by the window. Since I was sitting on the window ledge, it's not really at the right height for the table. Overall, a good experience and would recommend.

While visiting my daughter in San Francisco, she wanted us to experience the "best" restaurants. Her choice for sushi was Akiko's. We went for lunch on a weekday to avoid the busy dinner times. The restaurant had excellent sushi as advertised. The only issue was the waitress. You would think that at a classy restaurant like Akiko's the waitstaff would be great but not the case. We ordered then the issues started. The waitress insisted that I did not order what I ordered and everyone at the table was in agreement. After some rude exchanges, the situation got resolved. Lunch cost more than $35.00 per person and I expected excellent food and service. The food was excellent.

Recently, I went on a business trip to San Francisco. One of the goals I had was to go to a good sushi restaurant (in San Francisco, is there any other kind?). My boyfriend and I researched on cheap eats in the city and Akiko's is listed as one. So we decided to go there on our last day. The place is quite small, with bar seating enough for no more than four people, two tables for four and two tables for two. We were sat in one of the two 2-person tables (with one sitting in a chair and the other sitting against the window on a cushioned bench. The quality of food and service, however, more than made up for the small space. We ordered Sake, a sashimi platter that included a couple of slices each of five different fish that the chef chose, as well as an order of of the Escolar sashimi (five pieces of Hawaiian butter fish). The sashimi platter contained VERY FRESH slices of tuna, salmon, albacore, hamachi, and what looked like tuna belly. The tuna belly was a "melt in your mouth" experience, while the salmon (my favorite) was just buttery and smooth. It was the first time we tried Escolar sashimi - it was very flavorful and smooth on the tongue as well. The Hakutsuru sake was nothing too special (I'm a little bit of a Sake snob), but it was nonetheless good, cold, and provided a great taste combination with the sashimi.The bill came to about $70 for two people (certainly not cheap, but definitely a good price considering it's San Francisco and the quality of the fish). I highly recommend this place if you are a sushi/sashimi lover and looking for a relatively inexpensive sushi restaurant. I would definitely go back to this place!

So the first time we visited this place we absolutely loved it. It's a tiny little restaurant and was very busy but the food was so good so we decided to go two days later. The fish tasted amazing and the combinations were so flavorful The second time around we went there, the waitress was different and she mistook our order. That was fine but what I didn't think was fine is we saw big flies flying all around the place and the fridge door where the fresh was kept open all the time. I didn't see flies going in but it was kind of unsettling. Nevertheless, loved the sushi, loved the place and would recommend it.

I've just been to Akiko's, I'm not a person that usually complains and I liked all the good reviews. But when I sat at the sushi bar tonight I ordered my sashimi and after 5 min I've notice that the young chef was not closing the little fish fridge. So fish was in contact with air for the 30min duration I was there even when he was searing a roll with the small torch. I ended up deciding not eating my sashimi. I told the server why I didn't eat them. Hope they'll change there way to conserve the raw fish.

This is a great place with only 17 seats, including 4 at the bar. You can make reservation or write your name near the entrance door to be able to get in it, which worth the wait if you are a sushi and rolls aficionado. You can also have Udon and Teriyaki, as well as the chef menu, if you like this kind of food or experience. So basically if you have a chance to try it, do it !

The reviews were all so amazing that I thought this would be one of the better West Coast sushi spots. Quite frankly any Sushi restaurant that still carries White Tuna on the menu is being farcical. This stuff is NOT tuna. It is Escolar. And to be fair to Akikos they have it labelled as such on their menu. But fact is, this is banned fish in Japan. We all know Japan does not lead the way in avoiding eating odd things (dolphin and whale anyone?). But aside from that pet peev of mine, I found the place to be average at best. The size is ridiculously small but they pack it tight...which wouldn't be so bad if the sushi was better. The Eel was not warmed to crunch level, and certain flavors did not seem right. I didn't hate the place and would go back if in a pinch. Just not anywhere near my expectations.

We decided to eat here on a Friday night. We had already looked the place up and saw that there were only four tables so we were ready for a wait. The wait list is comprised of a piece of paper on a clipboard that you personally write your name on, it was the first note showing off Akiko's laid back atmosphere. The server came out almost immediately and let us know that there would be a bit of a wait- no problem! I just appreciated her coming out and letting us know what was going on. We talked to a nice couple for a while then headed in. The atmosphere is awesome. There truly are only 4 tables (there are four seats at the bar but it is a really small space, more for waiting for carry out). There is one server and she runs the place well. We were waited on immediately and throughout our experience were never in need of anything for more than a minute. We got the house saki, the chef's choice of sashimi and three specialty rolls. Everything was absolutely fabulous. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and the rolls were pure perfection. It is a laid back atmosphere and while small, it is fun and cozy! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

The sushi was very good and the rolls were unique. However, considering the restaurant has 4 tables, the wait staff should be a little more with the program. It's a good thing we were not in a hurry and are very laid back because we had to deal with items forgotten, reorders, and a waitress with very little brain cells. If you can overlook that, the place is great.

I can only talk about the sushi bar. We did not eat in the restaurant. I have nothing but praise for the sushi bar. It exemplifies everything I value in one: very fresh fish, an interesting variety, deft preparation, a little banter with the itamae. We had saba, some exquisite baby squid as well served as nigiri with a sliver of shiso between fish and rice, amberjack, hamachi, and some unbelievable salmon from New Zealand served as sashimi. Each bite was better than the last. If I lived in SF, this place would be a regular stop.The only reason I didn't award 5 stars is that I've only eaten at Akiko's once. A fifth star requires consistent excellence. I have no reason to think I'd be disappointed. This is a very small sushi bar. Plan accordingly. Make reservations. We didn't but happened by early and were lucky. Two places were found for us at the bar.

Order the SUMO roll!!!!!! And their daily specials are also surprising. Fresh and less conventional.I am always drawn back to Akiko--it's all I talk about when I'm enroute to SF. It is super tiny so expect a wait. I can't even find a website for them. There are two restaurants named Akiko. This is on Mason and it's close to Union Square. The best way to describe their sushi is delicate and complex. While I've never had to wait I've seen people wait to get it. The fish portion is a little smaller this past visit but I would still go back.The only drawback is the bathroom is a trek. It isn't in the restaurant.

I wanted to like Akikos's restaurant so much, especially as soon as we arrived. The location is wonderfully small and in the possible category for a "hole in the wall" gem. The waitress was cordial and attentive. She did confuse our order, but this was not my concern. My primary gripe was with the quality of the sushi. Yes it was fresh, but without flavor. Shiro-maguro should melt in your mouth with almost a sweet buttery flavor and texture, but frankly it was insipid. The salmon was acceptable, but it would be lucky to give it a 4 out of 5. As a result, we stuck to the rolls which I generally avoid. The rolls were satisfactory and I am sure for those who like rolls they would be great. The hamachikama was usually small and served with a lot of leafy greens, but was tasty. We had a more traditional maki hamachi negi, but as well not flavorful either. I am sorry to say I would not return.

Overcharged and Unresponsive - Avoid this Restaurant!

Date: December 30, 2016
My wife and I dined at this restaurant while visiting the West Coast back in early Nov, 2016, and had a relatively nice evening. The food was good and the service was fine, though a bit abrupt. Sushi was high quality, and the prices were reasonable. The reason for my terrible review is that when we received our credit card bill a few weeks later we realized that the restaurant had overcharged us by an even $100.00. No problem, mistakes can happen. However, all attempts to reach the restaurant to have this rectified have been fruitless. I have called multiple times a day for two weeks, left numerous messages, and have not received any response. We have also emailed the restaurant multiple times, and still received no response. This lack of professionalism is very alarming given the amount of money we were overcharged. Any respectable restaurant would at least have the decency to respond and make the situation right, but Akiko's is clearly not a respectable establishment. Very disappointing. I highly recommend that you avoid this restaurant or you may be overcharged and ignored like we have been.

I discovered this tiny little sushi place by accident whilst walking past and seeing a line of people waiting outside. I was looking for a place for dinner and walked in and luckily since I was in a group of one they had a space for me at the bar. I can't remember exactly everything I ordered but the food was so delicious I kept on ordering! It was amongst the very best sushi I've had and I've had it in a lot of places and countries. But this was divine. The standout piece was the Hamachi Belly nigiri but the Salmon Belly nigiri well as the crispy shrimp roll and the chef's sashimi platter were all excellent.The aforementioned Hamachi was just mindblowing in its freshness, texture and taste and the portions of fish were large. I liked it so much I went twice more in the next 3 days and spent more everytime! I'd say you can have a good meal here if you are on a budget but if you are willing to spend in the 60-100 dollar range (including tips and taxes and all drinks) you can have a mindblowing experience. I certainly did. And both the head chef and the stunning young waitress were both super-friendly and provided great service. A definite little gem.

Why is it that the best food often seems to be had in the smallest of places? I ate here one evening on a business trip. It was an associate's go-to sushi place in SF. We were a party of six but they managed to find stools for the extra two at a table normally seating four. Since I had arrived a little late I was one of those extra two. Regarding the quality of the food, I am far from a sushi expert but even I could tell this was pretty good stuff. Highly recommended, if they can squeeze you in.

Small- Homey- Good Quality Fresh Produce.

Whether a light meal or an extensive one, it's available here.I was greeted by Kathy & seated by the window in this tiny venue. It's easy to select from the menu. Service is quite quick even though I could only see one chef at the sashimi kitchen. The Edamame, Miso & Ebi Maki were all tasty & nicely served.I'd return here to try other dishes.

Worth the wait!

Akiko's was recommend by the concierge at the hotel we were staying in. When we walked up, we looked in the window to see 4 tables and a couple seats at the sushi bar. We were a bit apprehensive, but we were pleasantly surprised. We did have to wait about 29 minutes to be seated, but it was definitely worth it! The staff was really attentive and the sushi was amazing! We ordered the edamame which was delicious. For our entree we ordered the disco roll (a bit of a kick), the dragon roll, and the lion king roll. Everything was fresh and yummy! I'm not sure if they take reservations, but if they do I would definitely call ahead to avoid any wait!

Akiko's served us literally the best sushi I have ever tasted in my life - and I eat copious amounts of sushi. The waitress made many suggestions, all of which we heeded and never a disappointment. Everything melted in our mouths - we tried rolls, sushi, salad - all of it phenomenal. They also served some of the tastiest green tea I have ever tried, and when I asked the waitress where it was from, she went in the back and gave me a small bag of it to take with me! It's a tiny place so space is limited and you may have to wait, but do it - it is so worth it!

Very small restaurant. I ordered my food to go and took it back to my hotel. Very fresh and good portions.

The smallest restaurant with the best sushi

As other reviewers have pointed out, this place can hold about 16 people. But if you are one of the lucky few, you will get very tasty, fresh no-nonsense sushi. Worth a wait if there is a line!

Was here for a business dinner and the sushi was great. They had good variety and specials available. The my were also super responsive and helpful with a last minute reservation. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for sushi or sashimi

Excellent sushi! True gem.

The fish was all very fresh and every item we had was full of flavor. They were very accommodating in adjusting our reservation due to one member of our party being delayed due to air travel.

Warning ; this place can't Accommodate more than a dozen people but if your one of the lucky dozen your in for a treat. San Fran has more Sushi bars and Irish Pubs than Starbucks but this one is special. Cheap, fresh fish and good service ( which isn't hard when you have 4 tables ) but be prepared to wait at Lunch

Small, intimate restaurant within a block of Union Square. Exceptional sushi and great service. Not the best atmosphere - come for the food and you will not be disappointed.

Akiko's only seats 16 people: 4 seat bar, 2 4-tops, and 2 2-tops. We happened to luck out on a Friday night around 8:30 and a table had just opened up. There were four of us (all adults), and only one ate from the grill menu. The rest of us ate sushi: maki, nigiri, sashimi... All perfectly fresh, aptly prepared and completely satisfying. Try to get in there if you can!

Not an easy place to get into as it has around 14 seats. We waited outside after signing the notebook waiting list hanging next to the door, but got in promptly. Sushi is fresh and very reasonable, staff is very friendly

I really loved this sushi little restaurant. Food was delicious and very well presented. I enjoyed the sashimi and nagiri dishes. The ambience is super nice and the service is efficient. Highly recommended!

A colleague insisted that we go, so he was right. It was a small restaurant, 3 tables and three more at the sushi bar. But it was wonderful. The sushi chef was great at making us special samplers. Had to go back the next day again...

Best Nigiri

This place was fantastic. We ordered the chef's pick of nigiri and it was amazing. We also ordered the edamame and a spider roll and a bottle of wine. Everything was wonderful. The service was fantastic, all timed perfectly for an enjoyable evening!

Just as good as the first time

We visited Akiko's on our last trip to San Francisco and loved it so much, we had to return, keeping our fingers crossed it hadn't gone downhill and it hasn't. Food was just as delicious, the only slight criticism, is that they don't always give you the exactly what is described on the menu, for example, the BBQ eel salad was meant to have avocado and mushrooms, but we got neither of these, however, it was still really good. The sushi is the best I have had, I absolutely love this place, wish I lived in San Fran so I could be a regular.

Only has 4 tables!

Negatives:Long wait (30mins)Please be aware there are only 4 tables:2 X 4 people2 X 2 people3 bar stoolsThat was the major downside in my opinion because large groups couldn't eat there. Many people turned away too as they weren't going to wait for a seat. Positives:Food was reasonably priced and niceQuick serviceThey take bookings but be quick, if you're late they'll give your seat awaySide note - do not go to the one on Bush Street as it is closed. The new location is on Mason Street

We like to eat at this place before going to the theater, whether it be ACT, Custom Made, or SF Playhouse. The sushi and other dishes are excellent, and the service is friendly and quick.

Eating late with the kids and this restaurant was near our hotel. Was a bit skeptical as it's a tiny place. But, the sushi was very good. The service was excellent and friendly. Accommodated a gluten allergy too. Glad we choose to eat here.

I went there by doing a quick search on my iPhone. It was the closest of my location. I was really lucky. It is the best sushi I ever had no competition!It is true it is a small place. That make it ever more Japanese I would go again next time I am in San Francisco.

Warm greeting, attentive service, innovative menu. By far the best Miso soup I've ever had (tough to make Miso soup a stand out). Unique rolls - not your typical menu. 

Too many types of fish and way expensive

We were so excited. Someone had said we should go with the chef's choice. We like sashimi. The brought us 4 plates of different fish. It was too much. We had said we didn't want shrimp and were so excited to try the uni. Somehow we got the shrimp and never received the uni. We had three rice beers that were good. $350 later we weren't that satisfied.

Stopped by on a chilly Tuesday evening and found warm, friendly hospitality - and super sushi. The Sumo roll is a must-order and the Hana was excellent too. Easy walking distance from the 'Drake'. I'll be back.

I've had some sushi in my days and this is good sushi. The pieces are medium-small but it's a good value in comparison to other sushi places in San Francisco. I'd grade it higher if it wasn't for that the place is tiny. There was a man waiting for his friend at a table for four when we got there meaning he occupied four seats for just one person, that's a shame. They should have a policy for that to avoid missing out on costumers. We sat at the bar and service was really excellent. A plus that they had gluten free soy sauce!

Sitting at the bar (best place for sure), I had a wonderful meal of 2 rolls, a couple of snow crab nagiri, a tincy bit of wagu and some sesame ice cream for $42. Food was great and the guy making the stuff was a fantastic host. Slightly hard to get hold of someone to order drinks from but otherwise perfect. The selection of reds by the glass were a little limited.

Went here on a weeknight, frankly not expecting to leave particularly impressed given the nondescript location (the small restaurant is surrounded by chain hotels and parking garages). But, wow: I ended up getting two orders or sushi, a few pieces of octopus sashimi, and enjoying two rounds of hot sake. Excellent experience all around, not least because of the very friendly waitress.

Just what we were looking for

We stumbled upon this place almost by accident. We almost walked by, especially since we had an issue opening up the door. The restaurant is tiny- only 4 tables and a small bar to sit at as you watch the chef prepare your sushi. You have to walk in to another building to use the bathroom- but that's just a detail. Bottom line is that the sushi was delicious! Service was super fast and efficient. The price of the sushis actually seemed a little cheaper than other places we walked by, so we were super satisfied. Highly recommended.
