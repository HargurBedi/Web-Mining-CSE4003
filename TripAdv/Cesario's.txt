We decided last minute to eat here and were told by the rather grumpy owner that we'd have a table in ten minutes. We waited in the lobby of the veterans hotel next door. As my son is an active service US Marine this was of interest to us so we didn't mind. After waiting more than 10 mins and losing one of our party we went back to the restaurant to advise we didn't need as large a table. We were brusquely told by him to just wait. Once seated thankfully we didn't have to deal with him anymore and the waitresses were quite nice and friendly. The food was good. Worth a visit but book if possible.

We were looking for another restaurant on our first day in San Francisco, and we spotted this charming Italian restaurant, just a few blocks from our hotel. What a pleasant night. Our attendant, Irina, was extremely professional and sympathetic and made us want to return another day.

Avoid the ravioli - small portion
Rating: 3
Date: October 14, 2017
Restaurant looked promising from the reviews, but unfortunately we found it to be just OK.I ordered the ravioli and my partner one of the other pasta dishes. My partner wasn't even half way through his meal and I had finished. I had 8 ravioli on my plate. A couple on the table next to us had the same experience with their desserts - one being a very small serving. Whilst the food was nice, they need to improve their portion consistency across dishes, or adjust their pricing as it certainly wasn't a cheap meal. I'm not a big eater so for me to leave the restaurant still hungry was disappointing.

All the dishes were really Good except the spaghetti carbonara, this One was really bad. We told the owner but he didn't do anything about it. We asked the bill and there was a fee gratuity included of 18% because we were with 5 persons. It's strange that we must pay that and people who are with 2 not. And at the and of the receipt there was written tips are not included. After al the spaghetti was written on the receipt. We had a very bad experience here. Don't go if you are with 5 or more.

My first night in town and I was craving pasta. After wandering around and not really excited about the choice on several menus I found Cesario's. The place was inviting and and Cesario's delivered. I ordered the pomodoro which was just the right amount of sauce for the pasta and very flavorful. The bread and oil dip was lovely. I finished my meal with a flourless chocolate cake that was out of this world. The service was very attentive. As a table of 1 I was lucky but the place fills up quickly and many of the larger tables were already reserved.

I had a fantastic meal here! I really wanted pasta and we were out looking for an Italian when we came across this little place, it is small and we didn't have a reservation but they managed to accommodate us after about 20/30 minutes, we just sat outside and people watched.I had the penne basilico and it was Delish! Everyone had an empty place and a smile on their face after the meal.

We had dinner here twice while staying a the hotel next door. Frankly, both times we had mixed results. The restaurant is small but nicely located, you couldn't ask for better service and the decor is very nice. The veal marsala was very good as was a chicken dish with sun dried tomatos, olive oil and capers. The sword fish meal however, was rather overcooked and dry. The eggplant parmesan was the worst as it was so smothered in cheese that you could hardly find or taste the eggplant or sauce. For the price, we expected better.

This restaurant was just up Sutter Street from our hotel so went there on our first day whilst we found our bearings. What a find for the first night, this will be a hard act to follow.Small intimate restaurant, only seats around 50 which gives it that authentic feel and so resfreshing. Staff were lovely and could not do enough for you.Food was amazing and reasonable portions rather than then normal monster meals served here in the US?I could not fault this place and will be eating there again whilst we are here.10 out of 10

I really wanted to like this restaurant and i'm certainly not fussy when it comes to food, but my meal just didn't work. I had the crab cakes to start which (at $13 for the starter were not cheap) didn't taste of anything, followed by the lasagna which came with over cooked veg and somehow just felt stodgy and bland - again, the whole thing was just not so good. Maybe I chose wrong but based on this it was not good.Having said that, the service was quick and efficient - but would definitely not return.Sorry guys - i wanted to like it.

We actually liked Cesario's as it was convenient, a nice neighborhood restaurant, good food, excellent service, nice ambiance, and one big glitch. We were seated after about a 15 minutes wait as the manager was trying to get a window table, but guests were in no hurry to leave, no problem. We were seated eventually, and in a short while the manager came by and took our order. Our salads came right out, they were good except the pears were green and not ripe. After a glass of wine, the salad and a wait, a server (very pleasant) came by and asked if we wanted desert. We told her we had not even had our entree and she said there must have been a mistake as we had no entree ordered. Turned out the manager forgot to place our order. Apologies by the server, no big deal, she placed the order and we waited, and waited. People actually came in, ordered, ate and were gone, we still did not have an order. The manager came by every table in the restaurant at least once, but never stopped at our table or looked our way. 45 minutes later we were served, with more apologies from the server. We were not going anywhere so we relaxed, enjoyed and just watched the manager wander around. After two hours we were done, left a nice tip for the server who was not at fault and left. My wife asked me not to talk to the manager so I didn't. I think the servers were afraid to tell the manager he had screwed up and I am sure they were delighted when we did not make a fuss. I have to give the restaurant four stars however as the food was excellent. We will go back again, but hope the manager is not the one to take our order, enjoy when you go.

Overrated, guess you can find better places nearby.I had a buffalo mozzarella and a steak with risotto.The Basil is plain not aromatic, the tomato a bit hard, mozzarella too, vinegar too sweet.Thr steak is a big disappointment. Though I asked Medium, it's like McDonald's burger, taste like paper! The risotto is too soft, overcooked.I dont think it deserve a four star in San Francisco.

Okay service, food was not so. We were here in early March for dinner because it was close to Union Square and near hotel. We understandably had to wait for a table because we didn't have reservations. The restaurant itself is small and tables are very close together. There are no private conversations here. The prices are good. The chicken marsala didn't taste right, almost like it had soy sauce added to it. I looked to the kitchen to see if maybe there were Asian cooks in the back. Not so. The risotto was on the hard side, not cooked all the way through. The polenta was good. We won't be returning here after our experience here, nor would I recommend it to friends. There are better Italian restaurants in SF.

Re-heated pasta
Rating: 1
Date: September 3, 2017
Cannot understand all the positive reviews. This is a tired, dreary if not grubby, over-priced restaurant that serves up mediocre food, and in my case the penne pasta was hot on one side of the plate and completely cold on the other. As we were the first to be seated for early lunch I can only conclude that leftover pasta had been reheated. Casarios is expensive - a handful of dried pasta costs next to nothing and takes minutes to cook - unforgivable in my book. I did politely complain and the food was reheated and returned hot, without apology or any recompense, such as a complimentary drink whilst I waited and my husband finished his own, also mediocre, meal. Have a bit of respect for your customers, and the glorious cuisine of Italy.

We had dinner here last night, prompted by the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. We had booked a 6:30 table for two 3 weeks ago, noting its popularity, and arrived to find it almost full. By 6:30 you need a reservation. I believe there is seating for just 48 plus a couple tables on the sidewalk. Notable were the pear salad with candied walnuts and the bruschetta as appetizers. We both had a special of the day, lamb shank provencal, which was excellent. Noting other diners' meals, the servings are large and plates go back empty. The small kitchen bustles with sound which carries into the dining space. Attentive/unobtrusive service. Very reasonable wine list; a good bottle of house pinot noir $36. Heartily recommended.

We rocked up without a booking at about 8pm and we were seated right away despite it being busy inside. The whole menu looked amazing but i settled with the salmon piccata with polenta and my partner got the carbonara. The meals came quickly but in the meantime you're given complimentary bread with oil and pesto. Both of these were large portions and i was delighted when i saw the size of my salmon steak. There was also a lobster pasta special on when we were there that looked equally appetising. We did not order an entree but i noticed the massive sizes of the peoples entrees around us. The best thing about Cesario's is the reasonable pricing, and i was equally delighted when i saw the bill. The only thing that brought my meal down a little was the excess oil, could have done with a little less of that. Also, be prepared to be in very close proximity to other diners as the restaurant is small and they do cram people in. Despite this, I'd definitely return to Cesario's.

Decided to eat here as it was very close to the San Francisco Playhouse. Service was great and food was good. Tables are very close and was busy. The dinners were reasonable. I ordered the lamb shanks which came with risotto, along with carrots and potatoes. For me too much starch and would have preferred some type of green veggie. Flavors were good and portions were ample.

As other reviewers mention, this place is busy and sometimes there's a wait for your table. We too had to visit the bar up the road (where we met some interesting people from Orange) and had to wait a little longer when returning to the restaurant. This was a Friday evening - the place was rammed and there were lots of locals, which I always think is a good sign. The food was excellent. We had the day's special, lobster ravioli which was superb. Wine choice was good. Service was excellent - we were looked after by Eve.The only aspect which may not suit some, is that this place is intimate. Tables close together and quite tight. It's not a loud place though and the food and service outweigh the slight negative of being a bit packed in. We'd go back tomorrow.

Booked for 3 at 7:30 and arrived at 7:15 - fair enough no table available. The manager told us to wait 15min and go up the road to a bar with my 15 year old daughter to wait. Came back at 7:45 (30min later) and still no table - with no indication of when it would be available, simply said "Oh, I thought the table would be finished by now, maybe you should wait another 10min". Looked around the small and crowded room -the plates on people's tables all seemed to be very basic Italian. The menu consisted of pasta and starters. So we left. We were not impressed.

At the corner of Mason & Geary, Caesario's appears from the outside more like a coffee shop than a quality Italian restaurant, but don't let the outside fool you...inside is a wonderful space. I've been there for both lunch and dinner and both times the food was absolutely delightful and the service, usually by the owner, was impeccable. My friend had the Crab Louis and said it was delicious, while I decided on a simple Caesar Salad and white wine, both of which were perfect. Prices are moderate by San Francisco standards.

Decided to eat here after a short cable car ride. We didn't make a reservation but they were very nice and were able to get us a table after about. 45-60 min wait. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. We tried the chicken parmesan, and the special Frutti de mar. They don't have a children's menu but you can order sides individually and we got our 4yr old daughter spaghetti and meatballs. She loved it. It is very small inside and the tables are very close together. If you are on the wait list then you can sit next door inside the Marines hotel and they will come and get you when the table is ready. That's what we did to stay out of the cold. All in all we had a really great experience and would go back if given the chance.

A great restaurant and fabulous food. We had a very nice evening. It was a shame that when I wanted to pay by card, that the manager insisted it was only possible by taking my card behind a counter where I had no visibility or could not manage the card transaction. With card fraud being an international issue, I am surprised that this restaurant did not have a mobile card payment device. The manager said they didn't need them in the US!!! This is the only restaurant I have been to in the world, including the USA, that did not allow a card payment where I could see it and pre empt any potential fraudulent card activity. Had I offered my card under these circumstances, the liability would be mine if my card was used fraudulently. I do not suspect any misconduct by any of the staff at the restaurant but would have been a fool to hand my card over when I had no control or visibility of it. The manager would not allow me to stand by the fixed card machine behind the counter. A real shame that it took the edge of an otherwise lovely meal and evening.

There is nothing wrong with this nice restaurant. My disappointment as a local area resident since 1955 is how the City of San Francisco is changing. Cesario's is currently rated the #68 restaurant out of almost 5,000 establishments within the city, but I remember when dining in San Francisco was a special treat, and my parents would drive us hours just for that experience. The waitresses appear to be students from the surrounding highly acclaimed Art's College who are not familiar with either the food or the wine, and, of course, all of the kitchen staff appears to be Mexican (God Bless them for making most everything function in California). I do not think that anyone currently associated with the restaurant has ever been to Italy, where I am a dual citizen, and so speak from experience. The food is totally uninspiring for anyone who is even a marginal "foodie", but the portions are big, and you will not leave hungry. As you may guess from my Trip Advisor reviews, we did research about twenty dining possibilities withing walking distance of our hotel, and this appeared to be our best option, and so I leave you with that advice. San Francisco is a uniquely situated city with plenty to see, so please continue to visit here on your vacations. The city itself is evolving into a mix of young intelligent professionals working in high tech jobs and an entertainment world all of their own, a big tourist business catering to casual people in shorts and t-shirts, and a greatly expanding population of destitute people, lured to San Francisco by the extreme left wing politics and the many basic services available to them.

Service was fast enough but the food was nothing home to write about and the prices on the high side. Not a place I'd return to in a hurry.

We had a nice dinner at Cesario's, it is a small, quaint restaurant. It wasn't busy when we first arrived, and I felt that the staff was rushing us to order. They do not have a full liquor bar which was disappointing. The bread was so-so - expected more being in SF and an Italian restaurant. My husband had the lobster ravioli which he said was quite good. I had the veal marsala which was passable, it came with a side of vegetables that were cubes of squash. Overall it was okay, I was expecting more.

The menu is generous for the size of the restaurant. All of us found something we were very excited about. The food was delicious!

Cesario's was so busy when we passed first time, we thought we'd have to settle on somewhere else for our evening meal. However, on second pass, we went in and a table was found for us almost immediately. Queues at the door do tend to suggest a popular venue. Water, bread and oil were brought very quickly. Our pasta dishes arrived very soon after we'd ordered. My butternut squash ravioli was very nice if somewhat smaller than my companion's penne dish. A pleasant meal in pleasant surroundings anyway. 

Cozy, good ambiance and service

My wife and I (locals) had dinner with a friend who was visiting from out of town. The restaurant is small, but cozy. It was warm, in a good way. The service was excellent. We wanted a place where we could all sit for a couple of hours, eat dinner and drink some wine, and not feel rushed. They get a perfect score on that part.The food was good, but not great. Very basic Italian fare. Portions were huge. Prices were reasonable.Would give them a 4+, but not a 5.

Amazing find just a block off Union Square

This place is on the corner of Sutter and Mason, a block from Union Square. The food was excellent as was the service but the prices were a bit of a surprise as they were very reasonable. Pasta dishes for under $20.00. My wife had the lasagna and I had the lamb special. The portions were huge, so no need for soup or salad or appetizers. I advise couples to maybe split an entree, there was so much. They also have a good wine selection that is also reasonably priced. (We split a bottle of 2013 Sebastiani zinfandel for $40.00). The kitchen staff are also really quick, as we were surprised how quickly we were served. We definitely will go back the next time we are in The City.

Excellent!

My mother and I called in without a booking for dinner quite late about 9.00pm. We were greeted and seated and very well looked after. Our meal was excellent and service perfect. We were last to leave but were not hassled in any way. A very pleasing end to a busy day!

We had no booking and was seated straight away. It is a cosy corner resturant. Service was instant,water poured and complimentary bread and oil after that. Service was quick and efficient. The food was fantastic. Can recommend chicken marsala with mash!

We ate here on our recent trip and had a wonderful Lamb shank and my wife a pasta dish. Great food, great service. Gets busy fast so a reservation would be recommended. Well worth eating here. 

A Great Surprise!

We were staying at the JW Marriot in San Francisco and one of the hotel employees recommended Cesario's because it is right around the corner. It's a very small restaurant, but the food and service was amazing! You could tell that they also had a lot of people who ordered take-out. Our favorite dish was the butternut squash ravioli. My daughters were fighting over it. I would definitely come back here again!

This is a nice little place with great staff, very friendly and good value for money. The food was nicely presented and they offered a great selection. Oddly enough the Lamb Provencal was delicious (even though it is a French dish)! I went back and had Penne Bolognese and this was very good and they have a good selection of wines - all at affordable prices.

Tasty!

Great food in a quaint environment. If you are in the downtown San Francisco area, this is a great location to have lunch or dinner. There are not many tables so my suggestion is to make a reservation using the app Open Table. Ask for one of the booths so that you won't be stuck at a table in the middle of the busy little restaurant.

Got a last-minute reservation at Cesario's on a Monday evening--a must, as it's clearly very popular. We were greeted warmly and seated at a cozy central table. Service was attentive and friendly, and the food was simply outstanding. Goat cheese and Caesar salads were fresh and beautifully presented with warm Italian bread and herb-infused dipping oil. My pasta Bolognese rivaled the best I've had in NYC, and the chicken parm was termed excellent. Portions were generous, prices reasonable. Altogether a delightful place--recommend highly!

I was looking for a place to eat within walking distance of our hotel. I was able to make an reservation with just a few clicks on my phone. We arrived early and were seated immediately. Place is small but even at 5 pm, place was full. Food and drinks were delicious. Excellent and friendly service. And prices weren't too bad either for the city. Highly recommend.

I was pleasantly surprised by the great little restaurant close to my hotel Beresford while staying in San Francisco. The first time I dined there a few weeks past the restaurant at dinner was full but I was nonetheless seated as a solo guest at terrific little table, albeit, yes, it is a wee bit crowded there, but the service from the beginning was superb. I ordered the Paella dish and was blown away by the variety of fish and the exceptional presentation. The second time I dined at Cesario's was for lunch and again, I found it exceptional.

It appeared to be a family owned restaurant on the corner. We where looking for another place but we didn't want to walk any further. We where treated exceptionally and the food was great. I ate at 3 Italian restaurants while in SF and this was by far the best!

I've gone many times and always enjoy. The food is great traditional Italian, but what is best is the local neighborhood feel, while still being so close to Union Square. It is surrounded by all the bigger, trendier, noisier, pricier places. It's like coming home to your neighborhood restaurant. Perfect!

We stayed at the Beresford hotel just up the street and spotted this cozy European styled Italian restaurant so we had to try it.The restaurant is very cozy, the setup of the tables could be a bit further apart, but it doesn't form a problem. On a busy night it can be a bit crowded and noisy, but that adds to the ambiance of it all, the service also tends to suffer from busy nights.If you're looking for a restaurant that serves Italian dishes without other non-sense non-Italian dishes then this is the place to go to!Enjoy.

My husband and I had dinner here while spending a weekend in San Francisco. A nice, comfortable restaurant with excellent service. I had veal saltimboca and my husband had one of the specials, steak and lobster. Both dinners were very good (and his steak was cooked exactly as he requested.) Good food at reasonable prices.

We (8 of us) came at the last minute (without reservations) with a tight timeline before a show (at the revamped Curran Theatre). They were happy to greet us, a couple of tables where just getting up so we had seats, and they promised to get us out the door on time. They did. The kitchen was fast. The food was great. We had a really good experience.

Each time we visit San Fran and Stay at Marine Memorial we have a dinner at this restaurant. Food quality of mainly Italian inspired menu is excellent with portions giving you a hearty experience. The owner is often on site keeping an eye on service and always politely helping with service. We have always enjoyed our meals here and I have an italian background. The baked eggplant is wonderful and I always have it as it something that is traditional and so hard to get in ordinary Italian restaurants.
