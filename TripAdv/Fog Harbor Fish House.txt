Best Sea food restaurant that I have ever been to. Amazing crab, delicious clam chowder, and their sour dough bread is to die for! My wife and I came to San Francisco just for the food, and this was our favorite place out of all the places we went. The service was outstanding. Our waitress was very kind and helpful. We had an amazing experience and will for sure be coming back for more.

Dined here for lunch today and it was simply fantastic. Our server, Amy, was great. Very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant are both very nice. We started with the jumbo shrimp cocktail. Our entrees were the lobster tails meal, and the lobster roll. Both were delicious. The prices were a bit high, but expected for SF and especially pier 39. Would not hesitate to dine here again.

Nice place, a little bit made for tourists (but that's what we are anyway). It's very well located, in pier 39 with tons of shops and attraction like Alcatraz near. The food is very good, we loved their ward winner soup (it's a must try) and order seafood for sure.

After a day sightseeing in San Fransisco we found this restaurant rated as the best seafood restaurant at Fisherman's Wharf area according to Trip Advisor. We ordered blue cheese gratinated bread as appetizer. It was OK. Then mixed sallad also ok. And entree was lobster tail with potatoe puree and broccoli. Quite OK, but nothing extraordinary. Waiter service was a bit too jaunty for our taste.

We stopped into Fog Harbor during our first trip to the Bay area. We were seated for lunch reasonably quickly, and the view of the water was delightful. My wife and I shared a shellfish entree -- shrimp, crab, mussels, clams -- which was served in butter with a heavy dose of garlic. Absolutely delicious. Maybe even better was the fresh sour dough bread -- perfect for dunking -- with a crust that you just don't find any more. Our waiter was informative and considerate, we were unhurried throughout our meal, and it became a highlight of the trip. Would strongly recommend a stop at Fog Harbor any time you're exploring Fisherman's Wharf.

This is my second visit to Fog Harbor. Both times we've had delicious meals served by a highly efficient, friendly wait staff. Because it is on Pier 39, which is the tourist epi-center of the entire city of San Francisco (literally filled with mediocre restaurants and shops selling souvenirs) I initially thought this restaurant would be mediocre too. I was wrong.The restaurant is located right at the front of Pier 39 on the second story, west side. Most tourists just keep going past the entrance to the pier and head deeper. When we arrived at lunchtime, there was a big crowd waiting to get in. the Hostess is at the front in a refined, but crowded waiting area. With people lined up to give their names and get on the list, I anticipated not being able to get in or make any sort of request for desired seating style. the hostess was personable and informed us that we would have a fifteen or twenty minute wait (which was surprising considering how many people were there waiting).They had a few nice chairs and couches to wait on, or you could lounge outside on the second deck and people watch or sit on a comfortable couch/lounge chair while waiting for your turn. We were called and seated in a booth (as requested) in less time than anticipated - less than five minutes.Our waiter was very friendly and highly efficient. My wife ordered a fried seafood combo plate - Shrimp, fish and calamari served with cole slaw and fries. She raved about the taste. I had a dish of clam chowder (exceptional even by frisco standards) and fried Scallops served with a garlic/jalapeno Aoli. All dishes were exceptionally well prepared, flavorful, large enough in quantity to either require a take home bag or leaving some on the plate uneaten. The hot sour dough bread that arrived before our meal was fragrant and crusty - so delicious.Each time I've been a guest here, I have been impressed with how this restaurant handles the high volume of customers without making them feel as though they're in a production line. Everyone is seated quickly and service is comprehensive and thoughtful. It leaves you with a feeling of a fine dining experience with great food and service.

Reservations are recommended however they will accept walkins. It is a very busy restaurant for good reason. Nice views of the harbor, great service (thanks Wayne) and the food is terrific. Would highly recommend the Risotto with scallops.Also the only place in Fisherman's Wharf that really knows how to make a dry vodka martini....excellent.Best meal we had in San Francisco in a week.

We booked reservations on line for 6 p.m. on a warm Fall Friday evening. We arrived to the second floor restaurant and noticed the spacious comfortable patio waiting area. We were seated at a window table and were able to watch the sunset over the water as the evening wore on. Our server recommended the Fall special of scallops drizzled with a balsamic glaze over risotto with a pumpkin infusion and it was ample sized. We enjoyed a glass of white Monterey wine and ended with a shared house special pumpkin bread pudding. The meal was melt in your mouth delicious, the decor and ambience was charmingly coastal and staff were knowledgeable and efficient. We would definitely return.

Fog Harbor Restaurant We arrived at Fog Harbor at 11:45 am. Were seated promptly. Our waitress was very good! We all had bread bowl with clam chowder. The bread and chowder was delicious!! I would not recommend the fried seafood combo. It was a little over cooked. My grandson had the linguini and clams. He said it was just okay! If you are in San Francisco you have to get the clam chowder in the bread bowl at Fog Harbor! "Delicious"

We picked the Fog Harbor Fish House b/c of other good reviews. We were not disappointed. Greeted immediately and sat immediately. We had an amazing view of the Golden Gate bridge, the Bay and Alcatraz. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The food was fabulous!!! Not one person in our party was disappointed. I would highly recommend! My only complaint is with myself as I opted for the sole (which was fine) but when I tasted some of the swordfish a colleague ordered I wished I had ordered that! Delicious!

One of my San Francisco favorites.From the innovative use of very fresh local seafood to the well thought out wine list this place doesn't miss any of the details. The views of the bay and the extremely pleasant and helpful staff make the visit even more pleasurable. A pleasant conversation with Mr. Ryan Simmons, the General Manager, while I waited(briefly) on my table confirms their enthusiasm and commitment to quality. This is a don't miss lunch on my visits to San Francisco

Tourist Trap in Nice Location
Rating: 3

I suppose it is inevitable that all restaurants on such a hugely popular destination as Pier 39 will be tourist traps. Given that expectation, suppose Fog Harbour Fish House could be worse. This restaurant is an overpriced conveyor belt. I felt rushed as dishes flew out at speeds that would put McDonalds to shame. I had a bland seafood chowder and scallop dish that featured a wierd combination of stodgy risotto and some kind of sweet sauce (that seemed like to had come out of a bottle). However it was the rushed nature of the place that I found most uncomfortable. I suspect the manager is on some kind of bonus based on how many times they turn over tables. On the plus side, I had nice table by the window and got a lovely view of the bay (except for the big ugly yellow jet boat right outside). There are wonderful restaurants in San Francisco. My suggestion is go for a walk around Pier 39 and dine elsewhere

Ok, first let me say we are from South Florida and waterfront dining and fresh seafood are not uncommon. And found this establishment to be simply outstanding. Made open table reservation while on a bay tour, and seated promptly. Table for two by the window with beautiful view of the bay...was that a real seal on the dock?...of course it was, and don't get to see those in FL. We started with some wine, and experienced the chowder with crab, yes in a bread bowl, and tasted why it is award winning. Oysters were delicious as was the pacific cod and sole. I also must recognize exceptional service and Jeremy was outstanding and added nicely to our overall "wow" dining experience.

My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary at Fog Harbor and it was such an amazing dinner. I told them it was our anniversary when booking on OpenTable and they reserved a very nice, bayside table for us and wrote Happy Anniversary on the tablecloth. Our waiter, Curtis, was very knowledgeable about the menu and also very nice and attentive. We both had the cioppino and it was absolutely wonderful. One of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. We also had the apple crumble and blondie for dessert and both were very delicious. I would go back in a second next time we're in San Francisco.

We were somewhat expecting a tourist trap restaurant based on the Pier 39 location. We went a little after noon for lunch and it was very busy. We were told a 15 min wait but was seated in less than 10. Wait staff was on point, we at one point were getting low (not out) of our iced tea and the manager stopped by saying he'd have more over to us shortly. As he said that, someone had two new glasses for us. Not expected but appreciated. We had the cod ceviche for an appetizer, the clam chowder bread bowl, and crab roll - oh, and the bread. All were great. Light enough to be a lunch but filling enough to carry you through the day. We went on a bike ride after and we weren't so full to enjoy the day but satisfied to get us to dinner at 9pm later that night. Would definitely go back

Despite its good reviews, I was a bit skeptical about place being a tourist trap due to its location within Pier 39. However, the quality of the food was excellent and anyone wanting some good seafood should definitely consider it. I had a really good chowder followed by cioppino and enjoyed both immensely accompanied by some good wine. Being alone, I ate at the bar without having a reservation. If you want to have a seat with the best views of the bay, booking early is a must!

After a late afternoon tour of Alcatraz, my wife and I decided to walk from the Alcatraz ferry down the street to Fisherman's Wharf for dinner. The Fog Harbor Fish House is one of the more upscale restaurants on what is an otherwise "touristy" location, located on the upper level. Ambience was very pleasant, with sweeping views of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. The service was prompt, courteous, and professional, with all wait staff dressed in white shirts and ties. This is not a pretentious establishment; however it conveys a level of elegance and sophistication missing from the more pedestrian fried food joints on the main level.We both ordered the clam chowder, which was excellent. I choose the seafood cioppino, one of their house specialties (opting for the "lazy man" version, with the seafood shelled). It was outstanding stew of fish, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels in a light tomato sauce. My wife's halibut was a bit on the dry side; our server brought a small side of additional sauce that made a huge improvement.Overall, a very nice dining experience.

Had lunch here and the reviews were right. The clam chowder in sourdough (with crab) was fabulous. As good as Boston chowder. My husband had the salmon which was also excellent. Washed down with a few wines overlooking the Bay...it doesn't get much better. Staff were friendly and efficient. We were planning to go back for dinner one night but ran out of time. Totally recommend this place.

We found out about this place before we even left Australia for our trip, it was booked and waiting for us to arrive and the build up did not disappoint.We had a great table with a fab view of the harbour, unfortunately it was quit foggy outside that night (obviously where they might have got their name)We ordered the Seafood Chowder in a Bread bowl and Seafood Platter to share, both were absolutely amazing! Definitely the best Chowder I had across America, so much seafood in it. The Seafood platter was also exquisite, the best mussels I've ever had, normally the ones I've had previously have been small and a bit chewy. Fog Harbour definitely have good suppliers as these ones were huge, plump, and far from chewy! They definitely gave my favourite Oysters a run for their money!The service was good, not exactly great for the type of restaurant it was but nothing to complain about exactly.I'd definitely return and recommend to my friends and family!

Beautiful setting on the pier. We were on vacation and were given a gift certificate from my bosses before our trip. We decided to go all out and order lobster tails. We were not disappointed. The broccoli could have been cooked a bit longer, was cool to the touch and too crunchy for our liking. However, the tails were delicious and the potatoes were good. We had a seat by the window and were able to watch a sea lion jump onto a deck and spend time sunning himself. It was a lovely setting and the wait staff was good. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant.

We officiated our main mission of the day, to find an outstanding meal in the Fisherman's Wharf area. We drove in from our Yosemite adventure, checked into our hotel and set out on the mission: to find a meal that would knock our socks off. Well, that it was. My husband had the Whole Dungeness Crab and I had the Linguini with Clams. I tasted my husband's crab (of course, I always like what he has), which was AMAZING, cooked perfectly. My Linguine with Clams was just as DELICIOUS; probably better than any Linguine with Clams I've had, ever. I would actually have either one again. However, now that I was just looking at the menu again, and had a great experience, there is so much I would try. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, as we were expecting this meal to be somewhat commercial due to the location, but it was NOT. It was EXTREMELY YUMMY. Fine dining. Next time we will make reservations in order that we may have a view of the bay. And one of the things I must stress is that you can dress casual, which we love. Okay, now I want to mention (and this is a big mention) that our server, Justin, was terrific. He was so authentic and genuine. We caught him at a moment (when we arrived) that he was a bit emotional/overwhelmed due to 2 separate tables giving him a hard time. However, he rose above his emotions and was part of our EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE at Frog Harbor. Thank you Justin for making our experience even more memorable. We will ask for you when we return.

However, the fried seafood player wasn't the best. The fish batter was over cooked and the fish was not done inside. The shrimp tasted like they were frozen not fresh. The calamri was decent but I wouldn't order again. I would try this restaurant again but would order grilled or baked seafood.

This was one of our favorite restaurants of our trip. The linguini and clams are fantastic. The fresh sourdough bread is served warm with butter. The chowder is good for the area, but not New England good, if you know what I mean? The salad was the only thing that was ordinary, but the seafood made up for it. You will want a reservation or plan on waiting 30 or more minutes for a table. It is worth the wait, and they have an outdoor living room with a fireplace and water wall to enjoy while you wait. You can also hear music from the Pier, so time goes quickly. Our server was Curtis, and he was fantastic. Just the right level of pampering and care, but not overbearing. We watched the sun set over the bay, watched the ships sail past, all while enjoying this fabulous food. It is also one of the more reasonably priced seafood places in the Wharf area.

We had never eaten that type of crab. We are from the south and typically eat a dozen blue crabs at at time. So you can imagine our waiters face when we asked how many we needed to order. He pointed to the guy at the next table who was eating a crab and said that is one. It was HUGE, so needless to say we got just one. The food here is amazing, the drinks are great too! It is a little pricey but well worth it. We loved it so much we all went back at the end of the week. Highly recommend this to anyone visiting.

OK...I had to think hard about what to score this return but felt it deserved 5 out of 5 purely because the food and service was impeccable. We had lunch after an excursion and had great views of the harbour. We were sat within 15 minutes of arriving at a busy lunch period and the table was roomy and well presented. We ate Prawns for a starter with Sour doh bread then both had Clam Chowder in a sour doh bread bowl with salad and a blue cheese wedge salad.The cost seemed 'pricer' than expected but it is in the heart of Pier 39.Would I visit again? Most likely yes

We booked this before we flew to SF due to reviews. Not disappointed! Starters were huge you may want to order to share but we managed!! We had the mixed seafood grill - so tasty and the mash was perfect. We had a bay view table and saw the sunset. The atmosphere in there was lovely and couldn't ask for better service. Worth the money.

This was a great place to have dinner and a get a great view of the sunset. It was packed and we waited, but it was worth it. We had time to walk around and check out the shops. Once we received the notification text that our table was ready, we were seated by the window. The drinks and food were a great, but the real treat was the sunset.

The Fog Harbor restaurant had a very nice ambience. I had a table by the window. The waiter took my order right away. I ordered fried shrimp which came with fries and coleslaw and iced tea. The shrimp and fries were good but I didn't care for the slaw so I didn't eat it. So I would say the atmosphere was nice and the food was good but nothing spectacular. It was nice to find a restaurant on the pier that was quiet and peaceful as opposed to another one called Boudin which is very noisy and not relaxing to eat there. So I will take the atmosphere into consideration when I score this and not just the food. 

Delicious!

We are here after a day of walking around and it did not disappoint! We shared the mixed grill and fried combo and they were amazing. We did not leave hungry. The service was exceptional as well. There were windows all the way around and you had a great view of the bay. I felt the prices were a little on the high side.

Fog Harbor is at the entrance to Pier 39. Nice setting, harborfront, but crowded outside. Menu is primarily local seafood specialties (crab, cioppino, etc) and they are very good. Prices a little high, but not really considering the location. Service is very friendly. Go.

Great Meal &amp; Excellent Service

My first time in San Francisco, I was ready to try a local restaurant for some seafood by the Wharf on Pier 39. I decided upon Fog Harbor Fish House. We started out with a Bloody Mary and the Ceviche and then we got a Crab Louie Salad and split it. The Salad was the best Crab Louie salad I've ever had! Lots of sweet crab meat and a huge portion. You've got to try the sourdough bread as well... very tasty! Our server was great too! A must try if you love seafood ! DELICIOUS !!

Very good food and good bar selection

You never know about "fine" restaurants in such a touristy area, but the food and the service were both great. On the night we were there, they told us they were not taking reservations so we had to put our names on the list, and it took about an hour to be seated. Once we sat down, our waiter was perfect and made some really good recommendations; we were not rushed and could eat and drink leisurely, despite the crowded wait, so they get bonus points for this! I would return here.

We'd read about this place and went to it deliberately. We were prepared to wait, but thankfully that wasn't too long- a relaxing drink on one of their outside sofas and then we were shown to our table. the place was buzzing, but NOT oppressively noisy. We shared a calm chowder as an appetizer- superb and ample, under the circumstances; then onto our main. superb prawn dishes. Tasty and most filling- no desserts here. Whilst more expensive then surrounding restaurants, it was well worth it. quality, fresh food served in great surroundings- a must visit.

We enjoyed our meal and drinks at Fog Harbor. The menu isn't huge but there is something for everyone. We were a party of four - with grown son and daughter-in-law and we all enjoyed what we ate. We were seated by large windows with a nice view of the Bay. Wait staff was attentive and it was over all a good experience.

Went for lunch. Daily specials, draft beer, good selection of salads, sandwiches, and seafood. Nice view of the harbor. This place must stay busy all the time given the location. We got there around 11. I'm glad we did, it was already crowded and a wait by the time we left.Waitstaff was fun as well. A great place to acclimate to Pier 39!

OK - I always say, the next time I am at Fog Harbor Fish House I will order something different, but OMG the Fish & Chips are so so so good! A bit of malt vinegar and we are in business. Thankfully, my parents ordered other items and we could share! 

The food was good

We waited about 10 mins to be seated for a party of 3. My only complaint is the place lacked AC the day we visited. I understand SF isn't normally that warm, but that day it was. The food was good, although it was a bit pricey. We ordered the calamari as an appitizer, very very tasty the Caesar salad with 3 entrees. My husband and I ordered the grilled mixed seafood which was well seasoned. I subbed the potatos for a veggie which worked well. My daughter ordered the fish and chip which was disappointing for her. The fish, after removing the batter didn't have enough seasoning. 

Amazing food!

We went to SF for my husband's birthday and decided to have dinner at Fog Harbor Fish House since we are huge seafood fans. We booked a table a month out to make sure we get a table and upon arrival, we were asked to wait in the front. The wait itself wasn't too long and there was free wifi (you do need to sign up with an email address/FB account). We were taken to a corner table which was nice and saw written on the table cloth/paper "Happy Birthday" in red crayon. It was a nice touch but a tad amateur. Our reservation was for 5:45pm and the restaurant was already packed. Lots of families and kids crying so this may not be the best place to go if you want a quiet dinner. We ordered: 1) Clam chowder in the bread bowl - it's a neat concept and was tasty but we didn't want to fill up on bread so we didn't "eat" the bowl. And because it was inside the bread, there wasn't really that much clam chowder2) Shellfish tower - we don't like oysters so we substituted with jumbo shrimps. When the tower came, it looked a bit sad cuz the prawns took up less space than oysters (not their fault).. Everything was fresh but the crab was still frozen which was a bit disappointment. The dipping sauce was OK.. nothing special. 3) Alaskan Halibut - very nice and portions were generousWe got dessert on the house for his birthday and the bill came to $175 (aftertax and including 2 glasses of wine. At the end, a waiter with a loud voice came over and sang Happy Birthday. Overall, I think the dishes were all good but nothing over the top. We have had better seafood elsewhere. Would recommend if you are at Pier 39 and try to get reservations.

Good overall. A little more casual than you would expect for their price level, but it's not a problem and actually may be regarded as an advantage. Oysters are too small. They need to think of changing their supplier - there are much better options. But the fish was absolutely fantastic! It was probably the best pacific sole I tried. My friend had a daily special and also was ecstatic about the taste. Very good cuisine. Highly recommended. 

Wonderful restaurant right at Fisherman's Wharf!

I love Fog Harbor, and make certain to have a meal here whenever I visit San Francisco. It's in a fantastic location at Fisherman's Wharf, with great views of the water. It's best if you make a reservation, as they're very popular and fill up fast. On our most recent visit, we had went for mid-afternoon meal. Service was terrific. We split the sliders as an appetizer, which were great; the seafood is the best, very fresh and always perfectly cooked. They have a nice wine and cocktail selection. We were not rushed at all, and were able to relax and enjoy the food and ambiance. I look forward to another visit!

My second time dining here and again, it didn't disappoint! We had a wait time of about 20mins which was nothing. We were seated near the big windows and had the most amazing view. Our waiter was lovely and very efficient. Shared two dishes of crab and fried assortment of fish and shrimp accompanied with coleslaw and fries. Once again, was amazing! Thankyou :)
