My husband and I had our anniversary dinner there. We both had tasting menu though mine was gluten free and he enjoyed it with gluten. The overall experience was outstanding. The food was wonderful but what really set it apart was the service. They were extremely attentive to the details and made us feel very comfortable and special.

There's not a lot I can add to existing reviews, other than everything was as expected: amazing. I went there as a guest for another company. Just a few customers and we had a 3 course dinner with a very good Spanish red wine. Everything we got was very well cooked and presented. I even had a great coffee at the end of the evening, which is a plus.

Best Middle Eastern Fine Dining in America?
Rating: 5

Is Mourad the best fine dining Middle Eastern restaurant in America? It certainly seems so based on four dinners my family and I have had there over the past year. The food elevates Moroccan and Middle Eastern foods to the high level that restaurants like French Laundry attain. It's creative and introduces some local California produce while being true to the flavors of the Middle East. The service is top notch, and the wine list is exceptional (though on the expensive side - it's hard to find a good bottle of wine for less than $100). The decor is open and clean. Both upstairs and and downstairs dining rooms have plenty of room between tables. We had foie gras that was layered like a Napoleon pastry with pomegranate and served with semolina cakes that tasted like corn bread; duck basteeya wonderfully flavored and rolled in a flatbread with blackberry and creme fraiche; a soft-boiled Jidori egg covered in potato foam and topped with caviar (a twist on the traditional caviar served with hard-boiled egg on a blini); a large grilled Octopus tentacle; and a tender juicy Branzino served with shrimp and chanterelles. The sugar puffs for dessert were like beignets, with an apple caramel in which to dip them.Mourad demonstrates that non-Western European cuisine can reach the same heights as the standards we've known.

We had the tasting menu with the matching wines. Highly recommended! Fine dining at its best! Wonderful experience in a very pleasant surrounding. The chefs really do an amazing job, wonderfully crafted dishes. Each course brings new wonders to the table. Each course is beautifully matched with its own drink (especially liked the sake!). The staff did a good job and made us feel welcome and at home. We'll definitely come back. We're also big fans of the Aziza, glad to hear it'll reopen soon!!

Came here for a business dinner and the food and plating were divine. We ordered a few appetizers (get the eggplant- it's delicious!) and the whole duck, the scallops and the beef. The beef was so tender. You didn't even need a knife to cut it. I don't normally like duck but this duck was good- none of that weird duck smell. Would definitely recommend.

I've lost count of the number of great restaurants I've been to in SF - and one of the reasons I love going to this city is that there's always another great restaurant to discover. This time it was Mourad. Truly interesting Moroccan-leaning menu filled with imaginative dishes. Great presentation, all the dishes richly flavored. Incredibly attentive staff abound. Wonderful Sommelier...fussed over us even though we brought our own wine. Yes it's expensive...but you get what you pay for.

Wonderfully attentive service and excellent food. This was my second visit to Mourad. All the staff knew it we were celebrating my son's birthday on this occasion, and every one of them greeted him. They made him feel very special.They have a large communal table by the bar for people without reservations. They have a main dining area on the ground floor and the mezzanine dining area at the rear of the restaurant, next to the kitchen where you can view the chef and his team prepare the food.The wait staff explain the menu items in detail. We were seated next to the window overlooking the kitchen which we enjoyed.We will definitely be back!

When you enter Mourad on Montgomery Street, San Francisco you see a gorgeous wood sculpture and you wait by it to be seated. We took a group photo there. The bar was on the further end. A smart well dressed waiter ushered us to a hall upstairs to our reserved table for 8. It was a nice sturdy wood table with no table cloth. My daughter whose anniversary it was had made the reservations and incidentally had dined at Mourad's before and had tried the roasted whole fish and liked it very much and had ordered it for the evening. We started with a great selection of appetizers. Each plate was delicious. Two of the company ordered wine. So not much that I can comment on the wine! The main course was served and two huge platters were served with a huge roasted whole fish on each. Delicious!! It reminded me of my vacation in Casablanca and the taste of the fresh fish that I had there. Similar taste without the salty breeze. We ended the dinner with chocolate cake. It was a wonderful evening for about $500 bucks and the valet service was $40 for the cars. I have heard that the same chef/owner has another Moroccan restaurant in the Bay Area, called Aziza which I plan to visit soon!

I recently made a reservation for a large corporate party to entertain a number of clients and so was keen to impress. Unfortunately, despite research and positive reviews, I was highly disappointed with the service received. Firstly, you're limited to a set menu, which I'm aware can be to many people's tastes, but seemed lazy to me. Secondly, service was poor - abrupt and unaccommodating staff who wouldn't introduce wines or dishes to the table and simply plonked them down for guests to have to ask about beforehand. The event manager couldn't even be bothered to introduce herself or ask how things were going despite our hefty cheque. Thirdly, don't get me wrong, many dishes were delicious. But the chicken entree was mediocre and our guests weren't impressed. Upon flagging these issues with staff post-dining experience, I was told that in fact my impression must have been wrong as the staff were mild-mannered and therefore it was my opinion against hers, with no apology.So, I'm sure you'll have a great meal as a smaller party, but with so much choice in San Fran, I'd pick another restaurant for a better experience with a larger reservation.

I've had Moroccan for decades, but this places steps it up 100 notches. The same traditional ingredients but presented in such a chic setting (no sitting on the floor on overstuffed cushions). Duck was succulent, b'stilla was perfect, and the sommelier brought us the perfect wine from the Canary Islands to complement everything we ordered.

First of all, get the short ribs. Amazing. Now, the rest of the food was fab, as well, but that dish (and weirdly, the value it represents) was the highlight of the trip. The rooms are pretty, the service was spot-on, and the wines by the glass were yummy. This place was really fantastic, and as our first dinner on our west coast vacation, set the standard to measure all of the other places. Would highly recommend this place, and would go back in a heartbeat. Dinner for four with only five glasses of wine ordered (average price of each glass, $22..dinner is so much less expensive when some people only drink water) was $400 before tip.

Grab your best friend or someone who cares about food and you'll be treated to an outstanding meal with top-notch service and great choices. Start with some apps as the eggplant or the foie gras and then select a family style entree such as the lamb shoulder which comes with couscous, kale, beans, and potatoes. Impressive wine list. Save room for the honey-almond dessert.

Three of us went to Mourad for a special occasion dinner. We chose the tasting menu. The range of flavors and ingredients was impressive and delicious. Though most courses are small, you don't go hungry. You also get amuse bouche and other small bites that aren't listed on the tasting menu.Service was excellent, both table staff the the sommelier. We brought two bottles of wine and planned to order three glasses of sparkling wine to start. He told us if we ordered a bottle of sparkling wine, he would waive one of the two corkage fees and we'd essentially get the fourth glass of sparkling wine for free. Very customer-friendly.

I reserved on open table with a note that it was our anniversary and the restaurant clearly took that information to heart. Welcoming champagne, great table, and our dessert was decorated with acknowledgement of our event. Food was fabulous, very interesting combinations of ingredients, beautifully presented. We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was wonderfully done and really a special experience.Staff was friendly and attentive, they really made it a special experience. I look forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu. It is expensive but absolutely worth it. The completely fulfilled and went beyond my expectations of a restaurant of their reputation and caliber.

We were looking forward to going to Mourad as I am Moroccan and saw they had some flavors I know are hard to duplicate. The first thing to know is that even with a reservation they will make you wait - we had reservations at 8:15, were a little early as it was just around the corner from the St. Regis, and were seated at 8:40 only because I kept telling them my husband had to eat for health reasons. They really like to push you to go to the bar for drinks while you are waiting which we did not do. When they brought us in the back to our seats I was surprised that there were several empty tables - not sure if its part of the hype to have to wait. The waiter seemed overtaxed - his coverage area was large and the wait for food was considerable. It was delicious but we waited almost 30 minutes between appetizer and main dish being served.We decided on sharing so we went with the La'acha - family style dinner and chose the Snapper which they say serves two but 3 or 4 people could definitely have enough. Be warned - they bring you the whole fish with the head attached and looking at the teeth on the fish was not conducive to a romantic meal. We requested they take the head off and when they came back the fish was much more presentable. I am not sure why they didn't choose to do that, to begin with after showing us the fish for presentation value. The food was really well done - the flavors were unlike any other fish we had had on our trip, and the couscous, roasted potato were out of this world. On the menu it says that the family style can take up to 45 minutes which is a long time to wait for a meal. Definitely order the Moroccan Tea and the sugar puffs were phenomenal with the chocolate lemon sauce. We enjoyed the meal and would go again but choose an earlier start time so that by the time the food comes you won't be so tired and hungry.

I've been to Aziza on previous trips so heard about this restaurant by the same chef - it's next level.

We found this restaurant via TA and all the glowing reviews were so true! Lovely staff and provided assistance with the menu and enormous wine list. The restaurant is not cheap, but we found it good value. We shared the whole chicken with all the different side dishes that came with it. Was the most succulent chicken we had had in a long time. We couldn't finish it but they packaged up the leftover chicken which made a great hotel breakfast. Great international and local wine choices. Worth a visit - glad we booked as was very busy on a Tues night.

My wife and I ate here last night and it was disappointing.

Went for a special dinner with my daughter. Our server was well informed, but indifferent and somewhat rude. The portions are tiny and very overpriced. The octopus app was $20 and was very salty... I've had far better for much less..see photo.I ordered the Branzino... now this costs the restaurant less than $6/lb.. The dish was ridiculously extremely and the fish lacked taste. the vegetables were the best part, but the portion size would leave a bird asking for more. The price $36.. see photo.The wine steward was wonderful, 5 star and the wines were excellent, but pricey.All in all.. go elsewhere or eat before you come.

Had a fantastic evening dining at Mourad - the service was impeccable, cocktails delicious, and the food excellently executed. We opted to dine family style, ordering the short ribs which came with 4 sides - couscous in brown butter, white beans with feta mousse, kale with harissa, and potatoes with romenesco. We ordered a few appetizers, but the main course was the highlight - the short ribs were unexpectedly prepared, almost as if they were sous vide and then browned for a crispy crust - beautiful and delicious! I am still thinking of the heirloom beans with the feta mousse - I could have eaten the whole bowl! The highlight of dessert was the sugar puffs (think beignets) and the lowlight the chocolate dessert. I am torn about the space - there are elements that are interesting and beautiful, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in a hotel lobby restaurant.

Worthy of its Michelin star.

We went to Mourad on the recommendation of the concierge at the Four Seasons and it did not disappoint. The space is beautiful, but it's the here food that steal the show. Even something as 'common' (in San Francisco at least) as freshly shucked oysters is a treat. Expertly cleaned and served on a bed of rocks with a delicious mignonette of fresh strawberries and ramps. Mains come with a nice assortment of Moroccan sides. Try the slow-cooked short rib with dried mandarin and bitter greens--rich and full of 'umami' flavors. Despite what some reviewers have said, the service was first class all the way. During our meal, servers moved around our table silently in a choreographed ballet--attentive yet never obtrusive. Highly recommended.

San Francisco has so many choices, it's just not worth choosing Mourad. The food was fine, SF-level average, but the service was so poor I'd go elsewhere.

I had been interested in trying Mourad for quite some time and finally one day I stopped by for lunch. I wasn't too hungry so I wanted just one dish and a glass of wine. I chose to have the lamb tartare with a glass of pinot noir. It was perfection. The lamb was beautifully chopped and seasoned to perfection. Since I sat at the bar, I had a wonderful little chat with the bartender - it's always a bonus to meet restaurant staff that know how to engage the guests. I ended up getting a complimentary glass of amaro, which was very kind. The people watching was definitely a bonus feature, too. I look forward to returning....

The 1* Michelin Moruad's is expensive and the food though well presented, is average. A group of 5 tried 2 appetizers, the family style Duck ($125) and family style chicken ($75) and drinks. The bottle wine list is extensive, but by the glass it is limited ($14+) The duck was tasty, but the chicken was bland and dry even with the lemon zest. The side dishes were nothing special. The biggest problem with the menu is they state how much the family style dishes serve. The duck was for 3 and the chicken was for 2. In fact the duck or the chicken would have easily served all 5 of us. We boxed our leftovers and the homeless benefited. The decor is upscale modern with low lights, high ceilings, tables close together and the noise level not too bad the night we were there. The service is good (though intermittent) and helpful asking if we had any food allergies. Water is served room temperature without ice. A new trend?For the quality of food and the price I would not recommend this restaurant. As other reviews have stated, better meals can be found at many other excellent restaurants in San Francisco.

We had read good reviews for this place and it was also recommended by the concierge at our hotel The Palace. It's a Michelin stared restaurant and I can see why. The food is Moroccan with a modern American twist and absolutely delicious. The main courses take about 30-40 mins to cook from fresh so diners are encouraged to order a couple of starters but to be honest they are really not needed. The mains come with 4 sides and my husband and I struggled to finish it. I know most Americans take the left overs home with them but of course when on holiday that's not really possible. Waiters very helpful with menu choices and good ambience.

I'm not really a big fan of Mediterranean cuisine (other than Italian), but Mourad won me over. The duck Basteeya was particularly well-balanced in flavors.

I dined at Mourad recently and really enjoyed myself. I would guess, given its location, the restaurant is very popular with the "business" crowd working in the downtown area - lots of men in suit jackets and a vibrant bar while I was there. Service was attentive but not overly so or stuffy. Menu is not extensive, but lots of great options, some which needed a brief explanation since I was unfamiliar with some ingredients. I enjoyed the eggplant prepared three ways, followed by the rib eye (with turnip & leek). Everything was quite delicious and really pretty on the plate. And the portions were not huge, which is sometimes the case, but certainly ample enough to be satisfying. Overall, very pleased.

A *trick* to getting into Mourad!

Hey! So, because Mourad is not only delicious, trendy, and Michelin-rated, it's tough to get a table. Here's a trick!Their bar will serve the restaurant food! We have never had a problem walking in - there is a big wooden table in front of you as you walk into the bar. Our favorite seats are the ones to the far right (if you are facing the table) in the back. When you sit at those seats, you are then looking out at the bar and it is quite quiet, as you back to a wall. If you look up, you will see all the wines in their "cellar" (which is above you!)Mourad has excellent food and excellent, friendly service. You can start your meal with one of their "Morrocan-styled" cocktails, which are fun. I had the Pollen & Pepper, which has bell pepper honey in it, and you can actually TASTE that. Crazy. My husband had the Nori & Islay - with Islay GIN, which is just as peaty as Islay Whisky! (Who knew??) Then you can choose a few dishes off the menu to share.We had the carrots, the octopus, the basteeya, and the eggplant. The octopus was EXCEPTIONALLY good. Just perfect.The bar has a whole "bitters/herbal" section (I tried to take a photo, it didn't come out that great but FWIW it is attached). Watching the bartenders "concoct" drinks was great.Anyway - so that's our trick to get into Mourad! Enjoy!

Mourad does it right! The food is truly exceptional- starting with one of world's great cuisines- Morrocan- and adding special seasonings and preparations to take the food to a high level only achieved by the very finest restaurants. For example, the family style short ribs literally are fork tender and practically melt in your mouth and delivering intense beef flavor. It is cooked for 72 hours using a Sou-vide cooking method. The sides and appetizers are equally wonderful, just select what looks good to you and be prepared for the special flavors. The drink and wine list is equally impressive. The service is also top notch. Highly trained, alert, knowledgeable and unintrusive, a wait staff member always seemed to show up at the right time and to know the answer to questions about the menu as well as offering helpful suggestions about food pairing. When it came to questions about wine, Mourad's excellent sommelier was quickly at hand to provide excellent advice. The restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of SF, an easy walk from public transportation and many central SF hotels. While Mourad is expensive, I found the exceptional quality well worth the price.

We finished at a conference late and made it just in time to order food so worked out some share plates. We sat at the bar which is a really fun thing to do. We had the egg plant, rib eye,the lamb and the octopus with some really wonderful warm bread. The food is really perfectly presented and the flavours really very good. The best by far was the lamb which was just so enjoyable. We shared two deserts, the cake with the coconut ice cream and the doughnuts. Both were just wonderful. We shared a fantastic red and it really was an enjoyable friendly place to eat. The cocktails looked really fun too. The staff are really friendly and relaxed.

Dined here twice in as many days. Was so good I had to check it out again. The short ribs are to die for and the global wine list is one of the most thoughtful and fairly priced in the city. Portions are generous. Service staff is knowledgeable and provided great advice about the number and mix of dishes to accomodate our group. Definitely a do not miss destination near the financial district.

Went to Mourad for a business dinner - about 12 of us. We had set platters of salmon, dips and a spread of highly creative cocktails followed by slow cooked beef and chicken. All was prepared to perfection, with excellent side dishes. A really good meal, with attentive service.

We have been wanting to visit this restaurant but never had opportunity on our travels. Went last night and uber was late so we called Mourad and they were more than accommodating. They even let one of us do a tasting menu while the other only chose a few menu items. Creative, inventive, tasty dishes served by excellent staff. Courteous, well knowledgeable staff from hostess through bussers. Pleasant atmosphere-great wines-well worth it!

Loved the concept -- some innovative and fantastic dishes. Except...they serve you a big fish and than don't dish it out -- water glasses remain unfilled. Servers are friendly but too many gaps. Fabulous but over priced wine list -- incredible cocktails that are more reasonably priced

We had just had a marvellous trip to Morocco a few months earlier, where the food was delectable. Hearing Mourad had a Michelin star we opted for dinner here. It was delightful. It is definitely Moroccan food served with a Californian twist. Very nice to try, just a bit pricey ... but considering how far away Morocco is... this is a great place instead.

This restaurant has everything right. The food is pared and honed to perfection. All the share dishes are delicious and abundant. A wonderful way to eat by creating shared main courses in 2, 4 or 6 persons portion. The snapper is one of my favorite as is the short ribs.

In a city full of chefs and restaurants that rely on chemicals and emulsifiers to make make their recipes work then charge $250.00 to sample these chemically derived dishes; it is a great pleasure to find one that relies on chefs and cooks that understand the art of cook as well as quality ingredients. The service staff is well trained and clearly know what they are doing, our waiter, busier and food runner did not miss a beat. My partner and I so enjoy our meal we have already made reservation for a return visit. I won't go in to what we order I will only say do yourself a favor and make your own reservation right now.

The Best Spot. Don't Miss It!

We visited San Fran in October for a business trip. I tagged along and quickly researched some yummy local spots. Mourad was my first pick. The reviews said it was pricey so we booked lunch. I would have eaten every meal here. It was some of the best food we have ever eaten. My husband had a lamb dish that he raved about. I had the "hand rolled" couscous which pretty much ruined the store bought kind for me. As much as we loved and devoured our main course the feta beans appetizer was so over-the-top-delicious I'm still dreaming about it. The depth of flavor! I went out and bought his cookbook to try to recreate it! This will be our first stop when we return and I won't mind at all splurging for dinner here! It's worth it.

Mourad offers up one of the most delicious meals in San Francisco with modern, Californian takes on classic Moroccan dishes. The olives, duck liver, basteeya, and seasonal cocktails are not to be missed. Reservations are a must, though it can also be enjoyable just to grab a drink and appetizers at the bar.

Perfect thursday night, after the MOMA, get-together spot. The decor and atmosphere both sparkle, making it feel like a special occasion. The spectacular cocktails were original, and well described by our staff so each of us ended up with the exact right cocktail for our taste. This really was such an alluring moroccan menu, especially if you can eat gluten and dairy (one of us could not, so we were somewhat restricted in choices). Our family-style, shared, lemon chicken was truly yummy . . .we were just sad that we could not have any of the great sounding appetizers that had dairy. We loved the mix of flavors and textures we got with our blackberry goatmilk sherbet with crumbled almonds and sweet coulis.

Beautiful Restaurant, Good Food, But Not Sublime
Rating: 4
Date: February 16, 2017
Mourad looks impressive. A little dark, with an interesting color palette, your first impression is dominated by the huge root cross section of what must have been a pretty big tree. Points for beauty and interest. We were led to a table on the second floor, past an enormous, glass wine cellar (can you have a wine cellar on the second floor -- never mind). There were four of us, so we decided to have a few small plates and to share a family style dish. The Basteeya, a duck in puff pastry was very tasty. Flaky and savory, the creme fraiche, pear and lemon made it tangy and interesting. I'd get it again. We ordered olives that were also quite good as olives go (I'm not sure a bowl of even great olives is worth $7, but what do I know). For our main course, we shared the lamb shoulder. I really enjoyed the warm, hearty and flavorful dish. It was tender, and tasty. Accompanied by couscous yum!), kale (not bad), potatoes (meh), and bean (hmmm), the meal was hearty, but not really over the top delicious. For dessert, we shared the sugar puffs (kind of like really doughy beignets) and the honey & almond. They were good, but not fantastic. While it is certainly not a sin not to be sublime, it was, in this particular case, a little disappointing. With one Michelin Star, I had, perhaps heightened expectations. Good food, maybe great food, but not sublime.

Good food and service for a unhurried business lunch. The food seems to be more 'Moroccan influenced' than the other Moroccan places I've been, but that may be reflective of the lunch menu. If you have a vegetarian among you, there are some good options. It's a bit expensive. I'm just glad I had an expense account. Lively atmosphere, the room was just a bit loud for conversation, but otherwise it was a good time and conducive to the task at hand. I'd go back. 

It Met My High Expectations

The hype behind Mourad was a bit much, but I have to admit none of the three of us was disappointed. Mourad has a unique Moroccan menu, as you might expect. The Octopus and Kanpachi were exceptional. Meanwhile, the Short Rib is very interesting (not what one would expect if you don't eat Moroccan food) and tasty. The restaurant itself is nothing over-the-top but quite nice, reasonably quiet and comfortable. Our service was very good. It's not the best meal I've had in San Francisco, but that's a very high bar. So if you have not tried Mourad, make a reservation soon, go there hungry, have with an open mind, and enjoy a fun meal!

Probably the best top to bottom dining experience I've had in San Francisco! Wife and I went to Mourad for our anniversary dinner and it was amazing. I made a reservation and asked for a somewhat private table. I took a bouquet of flowers prior to our reservation and asked that they be on the table when we arrived. We arrived early and had a drink at the bar where they got the first big points of the evening because they had my favorite rum - 25 y/o Guatemalan Ron Zacapa. When we were seated the flowers were there & our table was a corner table so we could sit sort of next to one another as opposed to across from each other. Our waiter came with a complimentary glass of champagne & congratulated us on our anniversary asked if we needed anything and said he'd be back in a minute to allow us to drink our champagne before anything else. He returned and explained the specials and the specials of the house & answers our questions. We ordered oysters and carrots as appetizers - both amazing! Our entree was a family style Moroccan chicken which was a huge portion with absolutely decadent sides of potatoes, kale, and grain. Desert was the Chocolate and Sugar puffs. I cannot say anything other than book a reservation now and go enjoy yourself - worth every penny and calorie!

Excellence diminished by complexity

A hard one to rate in many ways.First up the venue itself. Serious amounts of cash have been spent on this place, no doubt to attract the high end diners from the trend venues of the Mission to a much less cool part of town. All soft lighting, art and half a quarry of marble. It looks great. Second the staff. Can't fault their knowledge or enthusiasm but they need to dial down their eagerness to please. Felt under-siege early on when were were still discussing our order and more than once the waitress answered a question directed from guest to guest. So eager are they to please our whims they fetched and poured a second bottle of wine without thinking to ask whether we wanted to chance wine (we did).As for food... plaudits to chef. The thought, the detail and the ideas are excellent. The starters were fantastic, but we all felt the main courses were over-burdened with ingredients. The beef, for example, could be as good or better if less complicated (say, lose two or three ingredients). So... close to pure genius. Close, but not quite.

My friend Ron and I got nostalgic about trips to Morocco. He also went to Aziza who was started by the same chef. Simpler things like Harrisa and Olives were excellent. The main dish came so late due to "busy" day (protesters etc) but they brought extra foods and comped dessert. Would have been a better experience if we came on a different day I suppose. Artsy presentation overall. I liked olives so I added into the plates.

The food was delicious. The egg was by far the favourite dish of the night. We did the wine matching with are courses and each was a perfect match. Felt we were rushed through some of our courses and our wine often came earlier than our dish. We had a later sitting so maybe if your doing the degustation try and book in earlier

Enjoyed lunch at Mourad this week. Have eaten here for dinner, so knew the food was going to be great. The environment is just buzzy enough but not loud. The restaurant is still newish and looks great. We shared a couple of starters, photos attached. The smoked salmon main is incredible. Wanted to try so many different dishes. Everything we ate was memorable and full of flavor: avocado toast (with ahi tuna), boneless chicken wings, olives, salmon. Recommend for business or pleasure dining. Share everything so you can try more items!

I travel 300 days a year for work, I've managed a restaurant in a 4 star resort, I've eaten at 2 star Michelin restaurants in nowheresville France. I'm picky.This was literally one of the best meals of my life. The olives were amazing starters, the eggplant was not my style, but cooked well and full of spice. But the entrees. Oh my lord. Our table of 10 did the tasting menu, and I could not stop shoving the short rib and lamb down the hatch. The short rib was SO incredibly tender and the lamb divine. The couscous was amazing (you'll never like boxed couscous again). I didn't even make it to the chicken. Too bad. The apple tart was amazing, but I wasn't crazy about the chocolate dessert (I like my chocolate plain). But the wine pairing and service were top notch. I would go back in a heartbeat.

We popped in around 9 PM on a Wednesday and sat at the bar, not knowing what to expect. We had stopped by earlier in the day for a drink and light snack, but they weren't open, so we went to Trou Normand. We were impressed with the friendliness of the front of house staff and the beauty of the entrance, so we came back later that night. Emilio took care of us at the bar and he was just lovely. We each had a glass of Picpoul and then I had one of the most delicious Pisco Sours this side of Chile. We had two appetizers, at the suggestion of Emilio: the Basteeya and the salmon. The Basteeya was decadent - rich, moist duck in a light phyllo with amazing sauces and a beautiful plating. The permissions were a perfect winter treat. It was so rich! It was hard to top the Basteeya, but the flavors with the salmon (it's smoked and served warm) were mellow and really nice. It was really delicious. The decor is just amazing, too. It's really a beautiful restaurant with rich flavors.

Eating at Mourad ranks as one of my top culinary experiences. The food was absolutely amazing!!!! Everything can be shared so you have the opportunity to taste a variety of dishes. Highly recommend the octopus and salmon appetizers ... the octopus was so tender and flavorful and the salmon melts in your mouth. The lamb and new york steak were lovely and all the side dishes delicious (my personal favorite was the brown butter couscous but the heirloom beans were a close second). I loved the sugar puff pastry desser and had a smooth glass of German Riesling (can't remember the brand) that was the perfect compliment to my meal.

Great flavors. First, the cocktails. They are all spiced versions of traditional cocktails. If you like the traditional cocktail you will like their spiced version. Next, the starters. Nuts, sweet and spicy. Olives, regular. Get them. As you sip the cocktail and review the menu, they will disappear and you will be glad you ordered them. Then, the appetizers. The octopus is the best. The duck is a terrine. The carrots are good. The eggplant is for eggplant lovers only. Then, the entree. La'Acha is a must. We had lamb shoulder. It is rolled with spices and served with dates and nuts. A ton of food. Incredible flavor. If you get the shoulder, you won't get to dessert!

My husband and I joined 2 friends for dinner at Mourad for the final evening of our annual culinary weekend in SF. (We had dinners previously at Quince and Campton Place, and lunch the day before at In Situ.)Mourad had amazing food--we all loved every bit. The pork rib main bowl was INCREDIBLE. We highly recommend the food!The service was a bit more complicated. It started off wonderfully, then disappeared. Both figuratively and literally. After halfway through our meal, I had to actually venture into the kitchen to get a server.The wine service was also a bit off. We got tremendous advice from the sommelier...but then had wine served to us at refrigerator temperature! A white wine should be cold...but this was ridiculous. The sommelier later apologized when I mentioned it...but no adjustment or other action was offered. Basically, we either had to wait 30 min for the wine to warm a bit or drink it too cold. NOT ACCEPTABLE. Overall, we'd return..but we'd have to be more insistent on better service. The chef was let down by his service team, unfortunately--all of them.

My wife took me here for a birthday dinner and we had a great meal.The appetizer of duck pate looked like french desert with layers of corn bread, pate and gelee, and tasted wonderful. My wife's appetizer of duck confit looked slightly less sophisticated, like a giant spring roll, but tasted fantastic, full of great duck confit wrapped in pastry.The entrees were great. I had a phenomenal dish of new york strip, perfectly cooked, served with beetroot prepared in various ways, the sweet earthiness of the beetroot perfectly complementing the beef. My wife had a wonderful lamb dish with more traditional Moroccan spicing.And then we shared a desert, a lovely mix of chocolate, vanilla and tamarind flavours.I think we lucked out on the seats, sitting by a glass wall overlooking the kitchen, was great to watch the chefs preparing the food.I would definitely go back, maybe next time to try the tasting menu.

top ten restaurant in world: innovative Moroccan inspired

Simply the very best of its innovative kind. Gorgeous and open space with great lighting, tile, and woodwork. Very spacious for sf tablesFood comes at three levels: the tasting menu is beyond anything the three Michelin starred French Laundry can pull off these days and almost as good as the three starred Benu up the street. The a la Carte is first rate including great salmon and squid and black cod, a very hard fish to air in-fishy. Then the family menu is very, uh, accessible if you were unlucky enough to be born in the flyover wasteland or voted for our local fascist and his illegal immigrant wife.I've spoken with the chef owner several times at his first sF place, and he's a real pro about sourcing perfect food like Japanese giant squid and then using innovative techniques - such as his amazing egg custard in an egg shell with caviar. The reinvented and much lighter but tasty basteeya is a tea gem.The drinks are better at his original Azizza but the sommeliers are great with wine, and they have some interesting choices among the very reliable staples like rich Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara.Also a great front desk staff that always remembers my Tibetan service dog and has great jewelry advice.

I strongly doubt you'll be disappointed.The service was very good, not great, but very good. There were a couple of long periods where we didn't see our wait staff, but it was a busy night, so I'm not really complaining, just mentioning it.So if you want to try Moroccan food, go to Mourad it won't disappoint.
