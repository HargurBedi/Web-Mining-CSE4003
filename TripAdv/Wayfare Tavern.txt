Being recommended here by a friend, we made reservations. We were taken upstairs to a small table. Our waiter was informative. He told us to get the deviled eggs as an appetizer. They were creamy but bland. I ordered a butter lettuce salad, small but delicious and parsnip soup. The soup was too sweet for me. The popovers they serve were my favorite. My guy ordered the fried chicken and polenta fries. Pretty good chicken with fresh roasted garlic cloves and herbs. The polenta fries were super. Truffled, need I say more?

This restaurant has an upscale pub feel but it's nicer than that. Eat upstairs if you can as it's a beautiful room inclusive of wood paneling, a gorgeous bar and an amazing flower arrangement. The food is good, service is fine, too. The star is the ambiance.

We stopped in at Wayfare Tavern while walking around San Francisco for lunch. The lunch menu was pretty small and only 1 out of the 4 of us found something on the menu. We asked the waitress if they could make grilled chicken sandwiches for us. The chef accommodated our request and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. The one person that ordered off the menu had the chicken salad and he said it was really good. We all enjoyed our lunch and we will definitely be going back on our next visit. The atmosphere is really nice and the waiters are very accommodating.

Upscale American restaurant with vibrant atmosphere ! First floor offers bar seats and separate boxes and is much more noisy than second floor, where you can find free standing tables. I prefer the noisier part - sit at the bar if you are visiting as a couple or sit in the box with bunch of friends. First thing that you will get are one of the best popovers! They are sooo addictive, but don't fill up on it ! Leave some room for, bone marrow, tartar starters and fried chicken or burger. You will enjoy every bite. Wrap up the with a drink or housemade doughnuts! 100% satisfaction everytime.

Our family had the opportunity to dine at the Wayfarer Tavern to celebrate my eldest daughter's birthday and we're not disappointed. Our waiter was attentive and the building decor inside and out is tastefully done. My steak was perfecly cooked and the chicken ordered by 3 in my party was delicious. Prices were very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. Yorkshire pudding was a nice treat.

This big band era restaurant is a step back in time. LOVE IT! The waitstaff is perfect and really cater to your needs, the food is delicious, well presented, and appetizing, and the restaurant (and restrooms) are immaculate. Had lunch here today with my daughter and husband. LOVED our lunch. The daughter had a BLT - with the T (tomatoes) being fried green tomatoes, and my husband and I split a salad and a Reuben. All came with delicious fries. There was also a huge beer and wine menu. We selected beers. All food a bit pricey, but worth it!A fun restaurant. I'd return in a heartbeat!

This is the second time my husband and I have dined at Wayfare Tavern. We had a few great dishes and some just ok. We started with the fried green tomatoes and fig bruschetta. Both were excellent. I really came here to have the fried chicken again because on my previous visit it was the best ever. I was disappointed this time. The chicken was ok, but nothing remarkable. The burrata whipped potatoes were delicious as well. We finished with some awesome homemade donuts, served warm with a peach dipping sauce.We were seated upstairs and found the atmosphere to be lively, and also loud and hard to hold a conversation. Service was average, but we would have liked someone more attentive.

Tyler Florence's new restaurant is a trendy bistro that serves new American cuisine. The food is honest and revels in its simple perfection. No complicated rubs and seasonings here, just perfect the pairing of grilled pork chop with grilled peaches and mushroom couscous. The gnocchi, the lightest and most delicate ever, are paired wth zucchini, roasted peppers and cheese. A burger that is the definition of what a burger should be. Great honest American food. The dining area we were seated in, was on the second floor and was decorated smartly. Not a place for easy conversation when full, but still very comfortable. Well trained, friendly staff. Great wine and beer lists. Highly recommend.

When you're on vacation, you escape away from your daily routines. At home, Wednesday night for you might be spaghetti night. All week long our dining habits have changed. After a few days, it hits you. I'm craving a good burger.I've been a Tyler Florence fan and I know he has a place in the bay area. Come to find out, his place is close to my hotel?? Awesome.. My wife and I walk into a beautiful looking pub. Inside there are a few tables available, we're also offered tables outside, I see they've provided blankets because its cool outside?? Nice touch TF, nice. I'm also told they have a chefs table available. I'm game, lets try the chefs table. Our waiter is ultra cool, he explains to us different beers as well as a refreshing lemonade. I order a beer, my wife has this amazing lemonade and then they bring over something crazy. Homemade popovers. BLT Steak in NYC brings these amazing popovers to the table. These popovers? Are BETTER than BLT steak! My wife and I licked the plate clean, soooooo good!We both ordered the same thing, the Wayfare Tavern Burger. From the perfectly baked Brioche bun to the proprietary grind of beef topped with brie cheese, red onion marmalade and smoked bacon, this burger was made perfectly. The fries are also cooked in a gastropub style.We had our burgers and felt like we had our fix satisfied. If you're looking for a beer and a good burger, Wayfare Tavern is the place to get your burger fix fixed.

This review is only about the fried chicken because it's the only thing I ordered at this restaurant.The restaurant likes to brag their chicken has been named the best fried chicken in the Country.It isn't. It could, however, be the worst I've ever tasted.The "celebrity chef" who owns this place should drop by now and then and see what the chicken is serving.Dried out, tasteless little bits of awful fried chicken. It really is that bad.Did I mention it was completely dried out?Don't get the chicken. Period.

The food was definitely good. The fig bruschetta was great. I was disappointed with the buttermilk fried chicken, as it seems it's one of their signature dishes. The chicken is good (not outstanding), but it doesn't come with any sides. Just a pile of fried chicken. I would expect the waiter or waitress so advise a patron of this when it's ordered, but my waitress didn't say anything. My boyfriend had the tavern burger and loved it.

FAKE FRIED CHICKEN

As the expression goes :" You can fool some of the people all the time and all the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time"Having had dinner with my spouse last week a San Francisco's Wayfare Tavern, I was very unhappy with the Fried chicken we ordered. Publicized as a top Fried Chicken San Francisco restaurant, we were enthusiastic about visiting this restaurant and very disappointed. My husband ordered Dark meat which was given with Bones, and I ordered white meat, but I was given all Boneless White meat fried chicken! The waiter reluctantly apologized that he should have mentioned this difference. Furthermore, the coated chicken was salty and very bland; this was a truly unforgettable" fried chicken".I think this restaurant tried to cut corners on time preparation for the white fried chicken boneless entre As an excellent cook who prepares fried chicken from several noteworthy chefs, and as a frequent national & international traveler, I recognize the difference.

My husband and I were delighted with our experience at Wayfare. The food and drinks were delightful and service was attentive and friendly. We were especially amazed by the bread rolls - for the Brits they're almost like a hybrid roll with a Yorkshire pudding! The devilled eggs are a big thing but we sound the buratta starter outpaced them. Both the fried chicken and the pork chop were delightful. We will be recommending (and returning to) this one!

The restaurant is beautiful and the service is perfect! The popover bread they serve is delicious but we found most of the food lacking flavor. The fried chicken, their signature dish was good. You get 5 pieces and no sides for $26. The hamburger was under seasoned and dry, even at medium rare. The pulled pork was good but the mac and cheese was also under seasoned. They do have wonderful sea salt at each table which helped. Enjoy!

My daughter (graduated high school) and I went for a few days in SFO to celebrate. We truly enjoyed the food and service at Wayfare Tavern. Couple of things: it's in the financial district so reservations are a must for dinner. We were happy to be seated upstairs where we could hear each other somewhat. The tables are very close together which isn't a bad thing but don't expect an intimate setting. We thought that it would be better appreciated with a table of four rather than two. We ordered the famous chicken accompanied by three sides - mac and cheese, squash and mashed potatoes. We thought that would be a good choice which was confirmed by our server, however the plate of chicken had FIVE pieces. Thank goodness we didn't each order a main. We are Canadian and hate wasting food. There was a large party in a private room and surprisingly our server was doing double duty. I would have enjoyed a glass of red with dinner however he did not come back to ask. Overall, a 4/5 due to the less attentive service and what really irks us as a waste of food. We were not told about the portion size and we were sharing.

Went here with some colleagues from a conference. The menu was limited and of the few sides, they were surprisingly out of asparagus at 6pm. So I ended up with just an expensive plate full of fried chicken. That being said, the breading on the chicken was tasty. The breast was somewhat dry but the leg and thigh were juicy. Disappointed there wasn't more to go along with it. Service was good but slow.

If you arrive on a weekday for lunch, you will have a wait. This trip, it was a Saturday and we were seated right away. The food is phenomenal and the service matched. The classic tavern decor provided great ambiance. Highly recommend the Tavern Burger - be sure to add the egg. The prices are high, but the food quality is well worth it.

We arrived in town without a dinner reservation and walked by Wayfare Tavern as we were exploring. They were packed, with no tables available within the next 3 hours, but had comfortable seats at a counter with a view of the bustling kitchen. We settled in for a real treat. Brandon was our waiter and he was wonderful. We enjoyed piping hot popovers that melted in our mouths. My husband had their classic tavern burger and was in heaven and I had the cauliflower soup and the arugula and beat salad which I enjoyed very much. I finished before my husband and the resisted clearing my plate before he finished, which we greatly appreciated. I wish more restaurants would follow that practice!If you visit or live in SF, check out the Wayfare Tavern

Tyler Florence's Wayfare Tavern is in San Francisco's financial district in the old Wells Fargo Bank building. It has been renovated to reflect the city's dining tastes in the 1800s, with both food and decor recalling that period.The number of choices on the dinner menu is small, but still caused us to think hard about our choices since most were quite tempting.On Tuesday evening, May 30, 2017, we dined upstairs at a relatively private table for two at the top of the stairs. We were delighted with nearly all aspects of our meal, food, service and atmosphere.We ordered two starters, roasted bone marrow and fried green tomatoes. The split marrow bones were huge, and the short rib crust with blackberries was delicious. However, the taste of bone marrow was totally masked. While the dish was enjoyable, we were disappointed not to be able to savor the flavor of the bone marrow itself. We jokingly called it bone marrow for people who don't like bone marrow.The fried green tomatoes also came with a sauce that tended to overwhelm the tomatoes, but it was easy to enjoy the sauce and tomatoes independently. And the crayfish piccata was truly amazing while the tomatoes were perfectly breaded, seasoned and fried. No complaints.Our entrees were the Scallops and Organic Fried Chicken. The scallop dish, which also included prawns, was cooked perfectly with a sauce that nicely complemented the fresh seafood. The fried chicken was hailed in 2016 as one of the best in the U.S. by Food & Wine magazine and lived up to its reputation. It included two breast pieces and one thigh with no bones, as well as a drumstick and wing. Each piece was crispy, perfectly spiced and juicy. It is definitely among the best fried chicken I've had, and I've had many decades of eating fried chicken.We shared a slice of chocolate cream pie for desert and were pleased at every aspect - from its creme fraiche topping, to its layers of chocolate pudding, salted caramel ganache and moist chocolate cake, and a surprisingly firm butter/cream cheese crust.Along with three glasses of wine, tax, and tip, our bill came to slightly over $200, about what we expected to pay.

This was our first trip to Wayfare Tavern, and it was quite pleasant and a new experience.It is a tall (4 stories), narrow building on Sacramento St., and there are a couple of steps up to the door with the accessible entry a little way down, and not too well marked. We were to be seated on the second floor, and there is an elevator to all levels (top two floors for parties and special events). WE usually eat early, and the place was busy and buzzing at 5:45. Constant coming and going that was fun to watch as well as keeping the energy level high.We split an app of burrata and strawberries. Cindi loved it, but it was more meh for me. Other really good looking appetizers on the menu. I had the fried chicken and it was very good, but don't expect that crackly chicken skin. I think they take the skin off befogging frying. Cindi had the pork shank and it was the best thing we tasted. Slow cooked, seasoned to perfection and huge.Everything is ala carte, so we got sides of asparagus and carrots. These portions were good sized, so if you want a side, it would be better to order one and split it. The asparagus had a lovely egg on top and the yolk over the veg was wonderful. The carrots were a little too al dente for me, and their flavor was overwhelmed by too much thyme.We had a pretty good time and would return.

So I would like to be at any restaurant the day it's being quoted as having the best fried chicken... then maybe I'd get to have some... but before I even get to the food... I went to this restaurant as a solo tourist. (And while like you - I really like only reading about what food is like because service and atmosphere are truly variable) I need to note that between the 2 guys at the door who were soooo busy trying to arrange something to the female waitresses on the upper floor who kept complaining about the restaurant every time they came to pick up their drink order from the bar... to a manager who interrupted my mid sentence conversation with the bartender about what to order to go talk to him "in private" like it needs to be said... customers shouldn't know the effort. It made me uncomfortable and their unhappiness was contagious. I left feeling miserable... For the food- the bone marrow was delicious as was the asparagus side. I sent my chicken back after starting with the leg and it was really flavorful but really dry... and I didn't think worth eating. Also- online their menu said coconut cake which I had saved room for... but was no longer on the menu. A shout out to Kate who tried to compensate for everyone else who really made this a place I would never recommend or want to go back to.

We LOVE fried chicken so visiting Wayfare Tavern after the Giants game was a must. The restaurant reviews claim it's one of the top rated Fried Chicken restaurants in the USA. First off, the bar stocked my favorite Whistle Pig Rye, so we were off to a great start. They serve a limited menu before 5pm, but fortunately it includes fried chicken and delicious hamburgers. There was so much hype to the fried chicken I thought for sure it would disappoint yet it surpassed everyone's expectations. The only dish we didn't care for was the burrata mashed potatoes which were very runny and soupy.

In the top 10 for sure but far from the best. Service was quick but our glasses stayed empty. We did eat at a wierd hour during shift change. With so many amazing restaurants in SFO. I am glad we have checked it off the list, but will not be returning.

Enjoyed drinks and dinner at the bar with my parents at Wayfare. It was super busy and loud so beware if you're looking for a quite evening out. We weren't able to get reservations but waited a few minutes to snag a seat at the bar. We each had a drink and then dinner. The popover style bread they serve before dinner is excellent and my Garden cocktail was refreshing. We had the gnocchi, fried chicken and salad which were all wonderful. I knocked off one "star" because the bartender didn't ask me if I wanted a second cocktail until the end of my meal (and it was their fellow bartender that ended up asking me). I'm not sure if this was because they thought I looked to young (I'm well over the drinking age) but I found this a little annoying. Otherwise I enjoyed my meal very much and would return.

A cozy restaurant in the heart of San Francisco's financial district, this restaurant caters to business people, some probably on an expense account. A group of us ate here and found the food to be ordinary. If you order their famous fried chicken, you'll get four pieces on a plate with nothing else for a hefty price. Make sure you order some sides to go with it.

We came for dinner, we're sat right by he door which was fine as we didn't have a reservation. The arugula salad was good, as was the gnocchi, however the fried chicken hubby had was underwhelming. Other plates we saw looked okay, but nothing too exciting. 

Don't expect too much.

Don't expect too much. Well, SFO is high priced, but this was still more than expected for someone NOT on an expense account lunch. Food was acceptable, but $102 for 3 persons with no booze, and a burger, fried chicken and a chicken salad was overpriced.

It's the experience

Neat little building and atmosphere. The popovers were a great treat for starters and the meal was good...not great, but definitely good. The restaurant is very loud, very cramped and the service is slow. If you have the time, it's worth the experience.

A fine meal!

Comfort food taken to a high level. The fact that we had to settle for a 5:30 reservation for 2 on a Monday night indicates how well received the Wayfare a Tavern is! Deviled eggs, popovers, bone marrow with blackberries, fried chicken, tawny port & donuts! What more could anyone want. We waddled outb--- very happy!

I have always been a fan of chef Tyler Florence and his restaurants and this one does not disappoint. Their fried chicken is to die for, no one does it like them. We got arrived without a reservation one night and sat at the bar and found it wildly entertaining, watching the chefs up close and being able to see every step that went into preparing our meal- made us a lot more appreciative.

Everything about dinner at Wayfare was top notch. My wonderful dinner began with a good pre dinner cocktail. I couldn't help but order the fried chicken and was not disappointed. The chicken was juicy and skin flavorful. My sides of potatoes and mac-n-cheese were both very good (especially the potatoes). With my dinner I switched to beer and was very happy with Wayfare's beer list.From my cocktail at the beginning of the evening to my dinner at the end, Wayfare was a great dining experience with delicious food.

The "best fried chicken in America" claim is probably not an exaggeration and arguably not the best entree on the menu! The sole, the pork shoulder and, yes, even the burger will please foodies along with the raw bar / sheefish. The popovers are really special as well. Downtown SF location easy to get to. Excellent service

Everything about this place was amazing from the ambiance to the drinks, to the appetizers through to the dessert. This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. The Yorkshire pudding was fantastic, delicious and delicate. The deviled eggs were nothing short of divine. I had the sole which was well balanced and cooked to perfection. We ended the meal with doughnuts for dessert. They were served fresh and warm with a lemon sauce on the side and creme fraiche. There was nothing ordinary about the Wayfare. I'd gladly go back the next time I'm in San Francisco.

I've been to Wayfare probably 6 or 7 times and it has never disappointed. The service is top notch and the food out of this world. I love the open kitchen. You can see the amount of care that goes into each dish, and if you're lucky, Tyler Florence. The fried chicken is a MUST as well as poutine and deviled eggs. Just get everything- seriously

I really like fried chicken so the opportunity came up to eat at the Wayfare which it rated as one of the best in the states. Not so, Popeye's is really better. Service was very good. All of the food we had was good to very good. The popovers were unique and very good. SF has many great restaurants and I would not return to the Wayfare.

The night before we had a $600+ meal for 4 and we would take this delicious experience at the Wayfare Tavern any day of the week!! The steak tartare is the best in town... just everything is delish! The service is great and the atmosphere is like a warm pub in the country.... oh and the warm popovers....yes please!

Popovers!

Excellent restaurant that serves their galactic famous popovers instead of a basket of bread or rolls. It is possible to simply make a meal by becoming engorged on these otherworldly creations. Entrees all interesting a quality.Then, to make matters worse on the caloric side, finish yourself off with the housemade doughnuts with the whiskey sauce. A pleasant death. Go down smiling.The only reason this isn't a 5 is due to the skimpy wine pour. For the price of a glass, it was disappointing.

I picked this restaurant off of the Top 100 Bay Area Restaurants by SF Chronicle. I read reviews and decided to celebrate my birthday at this restaurant. The service was great except they definitely want to keep you on schedule. If your table is needed to seat the next party be prepared for the staff to push you along. We tried the special duck appetizer. We were all very disappointed. The duck was served in sold square bites that were hard and tasteless. We all tried their fried chicken by ordering just the fried chicken and your choice of sides (sold separately) or the City salad with fried chicken. If you order the chicken, you get a half chicken with white and dark meats. For sides, we ordered the Mac n Cheese which was watery and lacked taste, and the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and mushrooms. The cauliflower and mushrooms were really good! We were all looking forward to the chicken since this is what the Wayfare is known for. We all had better. I was very disappointed as I made exceptions to eat fried chicken. The white meat was dry. The dark meat was more tasty. The chicken was good but not great. The City Salad is good but there is very minimal salad dressing on that salad. You definitely want to order a side of dressing. I won't be going back to this restaurant as the limited menu did not offer much else that was great.

Had a fine lunch (including the famous fried chicken) before we went to the cinema. No reservation left us with options: a table for two facing the kitchen, or a bar stool table. Both are great. The floral arrangement over the massive fireplace complimented the salads- We shared both salad and chicken. I want to go back again, soon. The interior is beautiful, the dark wood makes it cozy but not oppressive . The set up seems a bit more like a fine country inn than a "pub" in. than San Francisco. Upstairs also available. Service is excellent and pleasant. Hard to think how you could go wrong for friends or business.

went here for dinner. It was packed. Friendly staff. Went upstairs to bar and had 2 cocktails which were very good. For dinner shared fried chicken, gnocchi and salmon. We found the service to be average. We had to ask twice to get bread(popovers), despite there being a lot of waitstaff running back and forth. Our waiter seemed somewhat disinterested at times. Chicken was delicious and some of the best we had. Salmon was very good. Gnocchi was tasty but on the heavier side and not light and not enough sauce.

Awesome place for a powerhouse lunch or dinner!

We liked it so much we went there twice for lunch! The burger is awesome and worth a trip but you will be very full after eating one. Next is the fried chicken which can't be beat. We had to go back and have that too. This is not a cheap place to eat but it is worth the price. There is a lot of attention to detail; the staff are friendly and attentive. I would go back again for sure next time I am in San Francisco.

This place is located in the financial district just a 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Bart/Muni station. I showed up at 4:30 with a friend and we didn't have to wait for a table, however, due to its location it will be slammed with the posh after work crowd! If you plan to pop in between 5:30-7 expect to have a crowded wait near the bar or make a reservation in advance. Overall Wayfare Tavern offers a really lovely ambiance with white coat clad bartenders and lite fire place, offering the warmth of a tavern and the exclusivity of a private club. The menu isn't very creative but offers consistently well-done dishes like fried chicken, fresh oysters, and roasted bone marrow with toast. You won't be sending any dishes back to the kitchen here. My friend and I ordered a few beers each and split two appetizers, still $40+ per person so this is not a budget friendly eatery but it is quality. Despite the good reviews I wouldn't recommend crossing the city to try it out but if you're already in the area and looking for a posh but reliable after work spot for a drink or appetizers this is a good pick.

Went for lunch to this lovely tavern. Sat at a bar facing a spotless kitchen. Fire was glowing in the background. Service was excellent. Food was very tasty. Yorkshire pudding instead of bread welcome and delicious. Only criticism is the limited menu. Not enough salads for a lunchtime menu. But sides, seafood were tasty. Heard to beef tartare was excellent and the burger was huge.

Sorry, folks, but our experience was completely different from the more recent reviews here. This was our third visit to Wayfare, and we were looking forward to a pleasant night out. Because we knew the restaurant was generally busy, we made a reservation well in advance. As the appointed time for our reservation came and went, we were told that the couple at "our table" were lingering and that it would be a few minutes. After ten minutes, we were told the same thing, and after ten or fifteen more minutes, we were told that because of our patience, we would be given a special table by the fireplace. We were ushered to a two-top in a dark, drafty corner of the first floor, on the side of the fireplace, between a six-top and the wall. Our waiter acted like it was a chore to deal with us - after waiting another ten or so minutes to be recognized, his first words were, "Are you ready to order." We had to let him know we wanted a drink before we ordered; it apparently hadn't crossed his mind. While the food was certainly good, we felt rushed and left without dessert. While I understand that everyone has a bad night, the management here appeared to be lacking from beginning to end - if reserved tables aren't available at the appointed time, then there is obviously a scheduling problem; once we were seated there was no follow up to make sure that we were satisfied, and our waiter, probably because of the table's location, generally ignored us. I have often recommended Wayfare Tavern to friends visiting San Francisco. I'll be hesitant to do that in the future.

Great little two story Bistro in the FInancial district. Bar and restaurant. Dark, warm, cozy. Large bar downstairs and small one up stairs. One block north of California Ave downtown, within walking distance of the Omni and the Tadich. Started with the Beef Tartar; it was one of the best Tartars I had ever had. Shared the famous Fried Chicken and Mac and Cheese with my Boo. CHicken was perfection. Mac and cheese was OK. Toffee Cake was to die for. Staff were all gracious and kind. Bartender, Jana, was spot on with her suggestions. I will add it to my SF standards.

Popped in for lunch having walked down from Nob Hill.It was busy even for a Monday but opted to sit at the bar. As an appetiser was offered a popover which for any UK uninitiated is basically like a Yorkshire pudding. Different to bread but very tasty and lovely with some butter.Ordered their famous fried chicken with a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken was good although I would have preferred a bit more spice. The mac and cheese was amazing so creamy. All washed down with some Sonoma Sauvignon Blanc. The bill was reasonable and the service great. The ambience was that of busy but not too much, business American bar.

Our group of five foodies visited Wayfare Tavern for a Sunday lunch. Number of visits to this place ranged from three to six in the past few years. The ambiance is very hunting lodge-meets classic SF restaurant with wonderfully private booths, romantic tables for two near the beautiful fireplace, an open kitchen with barstools so you can watch the action, and a retro wood bar. The service is always top notch- professional yet fun, with spot on timing. Their drinks are even deliciously unique, from the non-alcoholic mint lemonade to my favorite mixed drink of all time, the urban garden(which they do not have anymore, but a white linen is close). All of this is great, but the real star is the fabulous food that comes out of this kitchen! From the beautiful salads, delicious soup, main dishes(fried chicken!), vegetable sides, desserts, and not to be forgotten popovers, served warm, everything is of the highest quality and spectacular taste. My favorites are: the fried chicken, served with sage, parsley, and thyme; the vegetable sides( brussel sprouts, pea shoots, mushrooms), and the desserts( chocolate cream pie and hot doughnuts, served with various dipping sauces). Our group likes to order and share, family style, so we can try several dishes. If all of this is not enough, their prices are very reasonable when compared to other fine dining establishments in SF. Wayfare Tavern is definitely one of the best restaurants in San Francisco!

One of my favorite bloggers had a few posts at this spot so I decided to check it out while doing my annual holiday shopping excursion in the San Francisco. I had no idea Tyler Florence was behind the place at the time I made my reservation. First off the place is buzzy, there were a few parties headed upstairs for private events (there are 4 floors), the decor is country chic with taxidermied animals/ birds on the wall giving it a very old English Pub country look, exposed brick and dark ceilings. It was cozy looking like a warm hug and I like that in a restaurant, especially in winter when it's cold outside. The service was great, very warm and friendly. One of the waiters was literally singing while he breezed by. He seemed happy to be there which in turn made me feel happy to be there too. Now to the food: They start you with yummy popovers, so good! We then had a green salad that had a lovely mustard dressing and avocado which I love. We then had the Brussels sprouts which are dry fried and delicious, the mac and cheese which was fine (not awesome/ not bad), I prefer elbow noodles for my mac and cheese, followed by the fried chicken. You get a nice portion of non-greasy lovely fried chicken. I loved the added touch of fried herbs on top. We capped off the evening with their donuts which were awesome, fluffy and the apple butter on the side was a great accompaniment.I would recommend this restaurant very much and I will return. The only downside was our table which was in the far back corner on the first floor and there was such a draft from above that we had to keep our coats on. I should have asked that we move our table one over as there was one open, my bad.
