City View Restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown is good but not great.We had a lot of dim sum which were generally good.The hsiao long bao were not very good.It is a very pretty setting and service is good.Prices are lower than Yank Sing but so is the quality of the food.

This was an interesting visit. First thing I'll say is don't let the name fool you. The only city view you see is the other side of the street. He food here is mostly nice. You need to know this before you go; you don't order food. The waiters come around with trays full of certain dishes and you pick and choose what you want (a bit like Yo Sushi). You can order for a specific dish to be made however. Also, there are no prices on the menus etc but it was reasonably priced. I felt the whole situation, although a fun experience, needed explaining to us as it wasn't and there was no signs etc anywhere. Also our cheque was whisked away before we were actually finished meaning we couldn't eat anything else and had to rush to pay.

This restaurant in Chinatown was awesome. We enjoyed it so much, with carts coming by if Dim sum & just selecting what you want to try. Loved trying the different tastes, but it all looked so good, you have to be very careful not to select more than you can eat. We wanted someplace different to eat on our Anniversary so this was perfect!

Came first thing on Sunday morning in August, no wait. 2 adults 3 kids. We loved it. Soup dumpling is amazing. Stay away from the chicken feet. Too many options too little time. Save room for dessert. The "donuts" are amazing and the custard pies are awesome.

Compared to other Dim Sum restaurants I have been in NYC this place is expensive. Quality of food is good but service it s just OK as the place is very crowded with customers. Be prepared to wait in line for a while before you get a table. 

Spacious, well lit, popular Dim Sum spot.

I really wanted to eat at a dim sumRestaurant with steaming trollies to pick your food from and City View certainly provided that. Delicious dumplings and spring rolls of all types served straight from the trolley. Arrive before 12 to avoid big queues. It was very popular with my whole family.

We stopped in for lunch and the line was out the door and on to Commerce Street, so we were prepared from a long wait. Surprisingly we were seated within 10 minutes. The dim sum were wonderful, especially the shrimp dumplings, the tofu and eggplant stuffed with shrimp, and the chicken buns. Everything was fresh and delicious. This restaurant uses carts to serve, nice touch. An early lunch avoids waiting time. Even if there is a line, don't be discouraged.

Day after Wedding Brunch

The wedding was on Friday, so we went to City View Restaurant on a Saturday morning around 11 am. There were about six people, including the newlyweds. Dim Sum was the perfect after wedding festivities place to go. We only had to wait a little while and were seated. Immediately we were offered tea and water. Then the carts started coming by loaded with delicious tidbits. I had no idea what I was eating, but it was all good. The best I could do was not choose items that had pork or meat in them to stay somewhat within my modified diet. One thing that was delicious were little triangles or rectangles that looked like pizza but we're deep fried chicken, flattened out. There were many vegetable delicacies too. I decided to just eat and not care too much what things were called. I might take some time and look up what is usually served at dim sum and see if I recognize anything! It was pretty noisy and fast paced and we had fun. No real conversations, just appreciative murmurs over the food! The meal ended when the dessert cart came by and choices of pudding-like desserts were offered. I had coconut, which was very good. My daughter, the bride, had green tea. She offered me a taste and it, too, was delicious. Others passed on dessert.The check came quickly, and we were soon on our way.I recommend City View for a great dim sum experience. My advice is to just taste and enjoy! And plan on a crazy good time!. It is perfectly acceptable to point at what you would like to try or just nod when it is described. It truly is an exercise of letting go of any control issues one might have! It was great fun for me to have plates appear and disappear, replaced by other treats. I guarantee you'll have fun.I was very full when I left, but surprisingly, I was hungry later. So don't fret about eating too much. They really are small portions of lovely food. It only seems like much because of the large variety.

Omg, I think I'm ruined for dim sum anywhere else. I have no idea what half of the delicious morsels were called but just say yes and enjoy! This place is packed from the minute they open, and I understand the waits can be long but so worth it. It's crowded and bustling and that just makes it all the more fun. And the food literally never stops coming! And it's all fantastic!

Patience is required if you arrive at noon time. Lots of people go this restaurant for lunch, so we arrived at 11:30. The food was excellent. The place could use new carpets, the restrooms are in the basement, and it smells musky down there.Other than that, great place to have a lunch.

We came here on a recommendation from our hotel and we were not disappointed! It was a little hard to find as it is not on a Main Street but on a smaller walking street on the edge of Chinatown. We were seated right away and we're eating within minutes. The staff brought by carts every few minutes and with a good variety of dim sum and were loved everything we ate. The staff was attentive and refilled our tea pot and water without having to be asked. They were able to explain the dishes to us if we were not sure what something was. Overall it was great food with great service and we would definitely come here again when in SF.

We visited City View at 11:30 am on a Friday. We walked right in and got a nice table by the window. The restaurant wasn't yet crowded and the carts were full of hot, fresh choices. We went a little overboard with our party of five: pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, scallion pancakes, chicken feet, and several sweet items. We picked about 15 dishes total and the bill was $100...a bit of a shock, thought it would be closer to $70, but maybe I'm still thinking about Hong Kong prices in the 1990s (I used to live there). By the time we were done, at 12:45, the place was full and there was a short line but nobody was pressuring us to leave and we finished our tea. Overall, the quality of the food was good, although my kids thought the chicken feet were a little soggy. Authentic, fun, and tasty.

Of course the place is somewhat spoiled due to being promoted in Lonely Planet and on TripAdvisor, but it is a nice and easy place to experience dim sum. Spacious, food on display on trolleys and presented to you at the table. I'm not a dim sum expert but i liked what i got. We were there on a weekday, and the line started to form outside around 11:45, so come early

Good variety of standard dim sum dishes. Expect a wait, though. Once seated a parade of dishes flows past with regularity. Choose your dishes, get your ticket stamped, eat. The servers seemed to really push the dishes but once you choose the dessert dish, your ticket is dashed off in a flash with a return bill...they want you out of there to fill the spot you occupy. I'm not sure if you can even order off a menu but I did see tables with larger than dim sum plates, so I assume so. I would return. Very affordable for San Francisco.

We arrived at 11:00 on a Saturday and made it just in time as there was only a 5-minute wait. Just a half hour later the line was getting long but it did seem to move fast. This was recommended to us by a local as being the best dim sum in the Financial District and they weren't lying - it was fantastic and authentic!The soup dumplings are not to be missed. We were told to order the eggplant as it is something different and not something you would see in most dim sum restaurants - it was a big bowl with tofu and shrimp cakes - great recommendation! All of their dumplings were fantastic. If you aren't seeing something come by on a cart, ask for it and they will bring it to your table in a few minutes.When you see reviews of slow service, etc ... remember, this is a dim sum restaurant. The food comes out as it comes out from the kitchen. This isn't like a typical restaurant where you order off a menu. We have had a lot of dim sum over the years - try this place out, especially for brunch!

Good concept and tasty food, but overall poor dining experience. With a table still full of food, we have been asked about four times if we have finished. We had the feeling that they wanted us out of the restaurant asap and have the bill done. And this while we were still eating the main courses and considering having some desserts. At the end we just gave up and agreed for the bill. What also bothered me was that the menu did not have prices on it. Only at the check out, we could see the amount to be paid. Overall price mid-rage.

Went with some friend to this very busy restaurant for Dim Sum. The food was mostly great and came to the table quickly. I did not like the Sesame Ball, but others loved them. We all loved the pot stickers and their version of crab cakes. My only complaint is that we went there at 1:30 did not get seated until 2pm and then were told that they closed at 3pm. When food came around many things were sold out and we were told that it was the last cart run. We did have the option of ordering, but that takes some of the fun out of Dim Sum. I would go again - just get there earlier!

We were only visiting San Francisco for a day and decided on this Dim Sum place to try after reading some positive reviews on tripadvisor, although we had to wait more than 40 min to get a table but the quality of food here was worth the wait... the large crowd waiting outside for tables was a good indication that this must be a pretty good and popular dim sum restaurant. I recommend this place if you are in the Chinatown area.

I love that they still display the food on trolleys that circulate throught the restaurant. If you're unfamiliar with the dishes, it does help to see what's on offer! The ladies who push them are, by Chinese restaurant standards, positively polite and usually quite helpful. It's not cheap Dim Sum and that's also reflected in the numbers of out-of-towners who come here. Whether you're an old hand or brand new to Dim Dum, it's a pleasant place to come. Tip - come as early as you can stomach it and especially at weekends!

Lotsa other goodies. Very savory.

I found this restaurant here on "Tripadvisor", WOW, what a gem. Loved this place, great food, great service......wish this place was here in the town I live in.City View is located in the Financial District, one block outside of Chinatown. Check their web site for the hours (from around 10 AM to 2 PM). The web site also has images of all of the items they have to offer. When you go there , they will seat you and get your drink order.......no menu is given. You see, the servers come around with carts and you just point to what you want.......cart after cart stops by..........such a fun experience. If we get to San Francisco again, we will go there again.

Every time I go to SFO, I am drawn to City View Dim Sum on Commercial st. It is simply the best bar none. We last went on Mother's day (not my best plan) and had to wait about 30 minutes. But during that time I met two Berkeley students, a couple of local business people and some other interesting folks so the wait was almost as fun as the food. There are not superlatives to praise this place. Trust me, I've been around and this is simply the best!

We never experienced Dim Sum until we visited this dinner establishment while strolling around Chinatown. What a great find! The servers were all very, very nice and the food was outstanding - very tasty and freshly made. I really liked picking out the dishes from the rolling cart. The only dish that was not good was tiny pieces of fried chicken that seemed all bones with no discernable meat. That being said, all our other choices were excellent! This will be the benchmark for any other dim sum that we have in the future.

Highly-rated and acclaimed Chinese resto just one block from Chinatown, this place is worth a try especially if you want dim sum.We arrived thirty minutes before noon and, thus, beat the rush. Wow! This place is attractive, reminding me of Dragon Beaux, but serving larger and more varied dim sum dishes. Although I did not pay, I surmise the prices are high for dim sum. Hot tea is not complimentary.The make-up of patrons tip in favor of non-Asians, who can eat Chinese in a comfortable setting.

As per title says, the food here is incredible.It's located in Chinatown a little off the main street but easy enough to find.

The food is great! It offers a fusion of old style Cantonese Dim Sum or "Yum Cha" and some newer dishes like new dumpling combinations. Some of the staff can barely speak English but you can understand them after a while. They always present new dishes and walk about the restaurant to show the patrons. I have to tell you that their prices are not cheap, but I still say it is worth it.

A friend brought me to City View Restaurant. I have only had "typical" Chinese food before and mostly take out. Admittedly, my expectations were low. I enjoyed this lunch experience greatly!As soon as we sat, servers swooped by with stainless steel carts steaming with all manors of offerings. My host pretty much explained the live menu and we settled on 7 or so different dishes. It was reminiscent of tapas in Barcelona only the food rolled to you.I would love to "menu-name drop," but I was out of my element. The food was different, tasty, well served and basically fun. My reservation on returning would be my lack of knowledge; I wouldn't go unless I was with someone who knew the menu. The experience was intimidating, but that is my problem.Try it!

City View has extremely fast service and servers who know how to get your "buy in." I really enjoyed the typically loud and busy atmosphere expected at a great dim sum restaurant.

Still, was a wonderful meal I enjoyed immensely.

This was our first Dim Sum experience and I have to say it was very good. I was hungry and was pleasantly surprised that the second we sat down here comes a cart with all kinds of steaming Asian morsels! Stuff I didn't even know existed but looked delicious I picked out and tried. Most of the food was good but there were a few things I could have passed on. We didn't pick out things we should have because we were a little worried we were racking up a big bill. But when the check came it was only 59 bucks for all 4 of us. I will be a little more aggressive next time All in all it was a dining adventure. It kind of had the feeling of the Brazilian type restaurants that bring around the spits and you order as you go. Like I said, this was a first so I'm not sure how it compares with other dim sum but I have taste buds and they were happy.

I have had Dim Sum before but always ordered at a counter and small hole-in-the-wall type joints in China town. This place I would consider just as Legit but definitely more upscale in terms of ambiance and cleanliness. The selection was incredible and the food was something special. They come out of the kitchen rolling carts full of different Dim Sum and you get to pick whatever you want. They stamp a card at your table to keep track of what you've bought. We ordered enough food to fill 4 adult bellies and our bill was only $59. It was busy but we got seated quickly. Check the hours of operation since they are different on weekends.

The dim sum at City View is very good but beware, they cook in peanut oil, which is a common food allergy. My wife is very allergic and anaphylaxes when exposed to peanuts. We asked one waitress if they used peanut oil and she said no. Fortunately, another waitress was passing by and said "Stop. We cook everything in peanut oil, except vegetarian fried rice." My wife had rice and 3 of us had 6 other dishes, all of which were tasty (shrimp dumplings, BBQ pork were great). However, this could have been a bad medical emergency.

It's sad that SF does not have decent dim sum. For the price, you'd expect more. But what you get at City View is a sterilized version of dim sum at an expensive price. SF needs to take a lesson from LA or NYC. Save your $$ and get a burrito instead!

Going out for dim sum is one of our favorite activities, especially to restaurants with this offering that are new to us. So when I read that City View Restaurant had dim sum and stood only two blocks from our hotel, it seemed a natural for Christmas breakfast. We got there just after its 10 a.m. opening and noted that the place was already half full and that there was no city view. Within 20 minutes, diners sat at all the tables and a line had formed.Employees pushed carts around the clean, bright airy room, stopping to show customers the tasty morsels available. Though it is possible to order from the menu here, we much prefer to select from the carts. If we asked for something not on the cart in front of us, an employee would request that item for us and we received it almost immediately. Our selections included rice noodles with shrimps, steamed barbecued pork buns, shrimp dumplings, Shanghai dumplings and Chinese broccoli. All tasted fresh and good -- not outstanding, but certainly quite satisfactory. I especially liked the green tea pudding, which we had for dessert. Staff were pleasant and spoke good English. They seemed very customer focused, which is not always the case in dim sum establishments. Someone always ensured that plates got cleared from our table as soon as they became empty.City View stands on an alley in the Financial District, where parking could be a problem. I recommend walking here. The restaurant is close to the Embarcadero BART stop.

This restaurant is on Commercial x Kearney fringing Chinatown and the financial district. We waited for almost an hour for a table as the dining area was not super big. Despite the crowd, the dining area in the basement was not opened. Dim sum was pushed around in carts and on trays. The space between tables was decent. We were not tripping over other patrons. The overall ambiance was comfortable, clean and bright. There was a wide variety of dim sum and they tasted good. The steamed items were not over steamed and soggy like in many restaurants. The fried items were crispy and hot without being re-fried. With the high traffic of customers, the food was fresh. The rice rolls were just okay though. And the tea was blend - no difference between the two types of tea leaves we ordered. A good place for dim sum in the city but do try to book ahead.

I like the traditional carts with the dim sum dishes that are pushed around as you can see what you are ordering - it is definitely a dying sight through Asia. Although not as refine compared to the more upmarket dim sum restaurants in Asia, I enjoyed the cooking style and taste the most of all the Chinese restaurants in SF. Gets crowded with lunch crowd coming in after 12pm. Definitely worth a try. 

great lunch

went with my wife as we wanted to experience very good Chinese food in SF - especially Dim-Sum dishes. and so it was - they go around with offers of things you know and things you do not recognize. we had more than 10 different dishes including what we can find unless it is traditional Chinese restaurant - chicken feet - you have to learn to love it and my Romanian born wife love it. all what we tried was very good or better. the waiting in the entrance was long (with empty tables around....) and the general service is Chinese (meaning bad for western standards).

I keep coming back

Seems like every time I'm in San Francisco I find myself craving Dim Sum. And so I go to the City View Restaurant. It is on a small side street with a tiny "view" of the city. The atmosphere is clean and simple. Staff are always friendly and helpful. I really like the food and the choices presented. Seems like I always over eat because I want to try one of everything. Do watch their business open times. We arrived a little after 1pm this last time and towards the end of our meal there they switched to menu orders only.

Comparing 13 Dim Sum Restaurants
Rating: 5
Date: November 14, 2016
Over the past few years, we have been to 12 Dim Sum restaurants in the Bay Area plus one in Hawaii. Here's our rating based on variety, taste, and ambiance: City View, which is about 1 block from the main area of Chinatown, has the best variety and taste, but the worst ambiance. Second is Taipan in Palo Alto which has the best ambiance, and excellent variety and taste. Third is Sino on Santana Row in San Jose, which has excellent taste and ambiance, but the variety is smaller. All three of these places deserve a 5 star rating. Din Tai Fung in the Valley Fair shopping center is only 4 star, because it requires reservations and the food is one notch down. All the other locations get at best 3 stars.

Excellent food and reasonable prices

Whenever we're in San Francisco dim sum is a priority, and usually we end up at the venerable Yank Sing where, apparently, everyone else dines as well. This time we branched out to City View and were delighted. Flavors were excellent throughout and our tab was exactly half what we'd paid for an inferior meal at Yank Sing the day before. We have a new favorite in S.F.. The place does fill up fairly quickly after its opening (this day at 11 AM) and you should either get there at the opening or be prepared to wait. Service is quick and the tables turn pretty rapidly. In the typical style of dim sum there's nothing warm or fuzzy about the decor or the service, but the food speaks for itself.

There is not a view but the food was very good and it was of course fun to have dim sum. We had beer also. The location was easy to get to. The staff was friendly with good service...lots of dim sum offerings. We filled up our table quickly so had to pass on a lot too. We were one of the first ones there but it was busy by the time we left, just after noon, even then there were available tables. Give it a try.

Small Plate - Great Prices and Best Dim Sum

Make sure you time your visit since you want to ensure that the restaurant is open (as it is not open all day). Plus it can be a bit difficult to find ....and if you need to park....well give yourself extra time . Best to use public transportation to get here and walk a bit. Generally crowded, but there are many tables so if you have to wait at all, it's usually short. The carts are constantly moving so you can choose directly, although there is a menu as well. Food comes out quickly - absolutely delicious. (looks great, tastes great) Small plates at a very reasonable price. Great find!

We all agree that this was the best. The XLB is perfect, thin skin should be carefully extracted from the individual tins. Best to arrive early, definitely well before noon to get seated with the first diners (and to get food from the first carts). They run out of the first batch about noon and the second batch comes out about 1215.

Summary- City View is the best place in town for dim sum and deserves a higher rating than Yank Sing! Food: fresh, authentic, high quality. Decor: clean and classy. Service: excellent. Price: Reasonable (for SanFran).In the US, I've had delicious dim sum in NY and FL. City View's menu is eclectic and innovative in comparison to other restaurants in the U.S. (You can't compete with dim sum at Guangzhou.)Decor: when you walk-in, you immediately feel like you made the right choice walking in. It's not your typical Chinese restaurant (in the U.S.) the colors are subtle and decor is modern but still Chinese.Food: OMG. I took my mom, who is a tough critic (yes, more than I am); and she loved it! We ordered 10 plates and all were superb from ingredients to execution. Most memorable : Duck Bao, Wu gohk- taro root dumpling;Lorh bahk go- Pan fried turnip cake; sesame balls; fried crab. We would've ordered more but were so full so planning to go again everyday until the trip ends.Price: well priced. Here is a comparison , we ordered 10 dishes and it costs $76; whereas the other place I mentioned above was $135 (almost $20 something just for the Siu luhng bao- steamed soup dumplings !!!). The other place was good (better than NY and FL dim sum), but City View left an impression on me (and family).Service: when there are no empty plates because someone is always attending to your table and refilling your tea and does so discreetly , then that's excellent service!!!!

It's all about the dim sum; a real find for solid, traditional Chinese small plates at a fair price; quick service via constantly updated carts that are always on the flow and an airy, light banquet-style setting.

Dishes are wheeled round on trolleys for you to see and pick. Good sized portions, normally cheaper than in London. Average, acceptable taste to Chinese std. Not brilliant but OK. Quick and good attentive service and expect to queue at mid am when dim sum is eaten at its peak. A fairly large restaurants and seemed popular with groups and couples.

The dumplings were delicious, but in my opinion, the lunch was a little bit overpriced and the service was not the best... I find it strange that this is considered one of the best restaurants in SFO's Chinatown...

This was a great place for dim sum. Yes I know it's in all the guidebooks and that might not be the best recommendation but it really is all it's cracked up to be. Lovely food, quick and pleasant service and very fresh food. We had a range of things (even chicken's feet which wre tasty if boney) that averaged $6 a plate. So good value. Strong Recommend. There was a small queue (less than 10 minute wait) on a Sunday lunchtime but it went quickly. You have to go inside and add you name to the list along with the number in your party. Then someone will come and get you when there's a table free so don't hang around outside without getting your name on the list - you might be there for a long time!

My husband and I had never had Dim Sum before. I am a healthy eater and usually steer clear of Chinese food unless I know it is fresh and can taste the ingredients. This fit the bill! The scallop dumplings were phenomenal. Every dish and sauce was crisp and clean--nothing was over done! Of course, we indulged in some things I normally would not, such as a friend ball of crab with an entire crab finger poking out. There were no fillers--rather, this beautiful puff was a lightly fried ball of CRAB! :). I loved the Chinese broccoli, and the snow peas looked outstanding, but the plate of Chinese broccoli was huge--enough to take the place of a dinner salad. We also enjoyed--pork dumplings, peking duck, lettuce wrap with chicken, shrimp dumplings. This was one of our most memorable meals during our trip to SF and the cheapest. We ate at some fine restaurants, I might add.

Great overall dining experience. Wide variety of dishes. Everything was truly delicious. We tried it in the beginning of our vacation, and had to go back one more time before we went home. There are numerous dim sum carts that are constantly coming by the table, and the staff is very helpful.

Large, authentic dim sum that can b ordered off menu or chosen from the push carts that have a large selection- after 2 pm the carts stop and it is menu only- fresh and delicious if you are in Chinatown- steps from Hilton Financial Hotel

We had a very nice dim sum meal. We got there around 10AM and beat the crowd and were able to sit down directly. We had great food with the exception to a cold order of pot stickers. Otherwise it was great. The city view was a first floor view into parked cars and store fronts, not exactly a romanic view by the way...

We had one day to spend in San Francisco and I wanted to see Chinatown and eat dim sum for lunch. A local told us about City View. We walked into a very clean and attractive restaurant and saw the carts being pushed among the tables. We were seated fairly quickly and the eating began! Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious. We particularly enjoyed the Chinese broccoli, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, shrimp and chive dumplings, etc. I did not see Taro on the carts, so I asked and was told we would have to order it, and we did. It was the best taro I have ever had. We ate way too much for 2 people, but enjoyed every bite. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

The food here is very very good and the presentation is unique. We love it! They bring all the different unique selections around to your table and you choose what you want when you want it. You get to sample lots of selections, you can eat all you want, but you don't leave feeling way to full like a buffet type place.If you are going to San Francisco and Chinatown then you must not miss this restaurant!

After spending the morning shopping & exploring Union Square and Chinatown, our group of 5 was craving Chinese food, and City View Restaurant was just the ticket. The wait for a table was about 20 minutes, but that's not bad considering we arrived right at noon. Friendly staff and fast food service - everything we tried was delicious, we all had a fabulous time (and probably ate a little too much!) Don't get taken in by the restaurant name - there's no view, just great food and service!

Tasty but be prepared for a wait!

Great dim sum with an easy to find location- parking is very easy at Portsmouth Square Garage and then City View is maybe a block away... I was very impressed with how clean & busy the restaurant was- we tried to go for a Friday lunch, but there were 8+ parties ahead of us, and they stop serving dim sum around 3pm so we went somewhere else and came back for Saturday lunch. The wait wasn't too long- they turn over tables quite quickly- and we got a table for two within 20 mins. of arriving. Tip- make a reservation so you don't have to wait! My mom had never had dim sum before so it was a fun experience for her. I've had it once before so I started with my favorite- the steamed pork buns! We also had the chicken skewers, some shrimp rolls, a veggie roll thing.. so much food, and it was all soo good! The dim sum carts seemed to come around every 5 mins if not more often. I enjoyed the dessert cart too- their egg custards are soo yummy (not very sweet). Putting this one on my list to visit again- with a reservation of course!

We brought our firm here for a late lunch and it was the perfect thing to do. We were all very hungry and as soon as you sit down the carts of food start rolling in. Your food comes instantly! We were extremely satisfied with the food and service. The restaurant itself is nice for a business lunch for our group of 11. It's tucked away down a side sreet so you're away from the street noise.

Have been craving dim sum like this for ages. Authentic, delicious food. My fave place to stop when I'm in the city. We went for lunch, but recommend getting there at 11:30 as there is a wait at 12-12:30pm. Plan to get amazing food, in and out of there within an hour.

Oddly located just off the main China Town district and a little hard to find but worth the effort. The facility is very clean and the service was outstanding but all of this pales in comparison to the excellent food. Not only do I recommend City View for all of the above but it is also a fun place to have lunch with friends. Our experience was so delightful we retunred a few days later for another great meal.
