 This restaurant was an easy walk from the Omni Hotel where we were staying. Definitely make reservations for the weekend. They offered a three course meal for $35 with two choices in each category as well as an optional pasta dish for extra money. The food was all delicious. The service Was very helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Creative well thought out menu choices that brought amazing food for an incredible price. The staff was thoughtful, helpful and asked questions about food allergies as part of taking our orders. Very professional and helpful but also relaxed and friendly. The menu is a fixed price for $35.00. We were visiting from out of town and made our reservation a month or so before visiting. Don't wing it-it is worth making a reservation as the restaurant is small. I would give the service a 10 out of 5 stars....

An Eater38 best restaurant in San Francisco, the menu is simple fixed price but excellent blending of ingredients. Just enough food. Fair affordable price in a comfortable setting. Friendly staff, who are very attentive. Make reservations, as small space. Wine list is great boutique sampling at a very reasonable price for the quality. Ask for the bread. Great for Just friends or family or business casual.

Firstly Trestle is not a big restaurant, so highly recommend booking in advance. It is a really cool space and atmosphere.The menu is written up daily, so is fresh and market driven. For the standard of the food it was excellent value - go before they realise people would happily pay more ! $35 for 3 courses, only a few choices for each course, (on our night for Main Course there was an Ocean Trout and a Steak dish offered) - highly recommend for $10 extra, sharing the 'pasta' dish - it also changes, we chose the most delicious risotto (and I am not usually a risotto fan)The service was excellent, and there is a comprehensive wine list.If you have dietary requirements they are happy to accommodate, but do advise when booking, and book in advance. Have already been recommending it to friends we know visit San Francisco.

We stopped by Trestle during our last SF trip. It's very small and we did not notice it until we were right in front of it. I really liked the decor and atmosphere inside, very modern but not cold. We were offered menus listing a 3 course pre fixe menu. You can add an additional course for about $10. We opted to get an extra pasta dish and split it. The food was fantastic, though I felt the portions were on the small side, I wasn't quite full at the end of the meal. Otherwise, the food was fantastic, as was the service.

The menu is seasonal and offers 3 courses for $35, although there are limited options to choose from they accommodated dietary needs graciously, we did not try the optional pasta course (extra) and felt the meal was just right without it. The tomato soup with avo, crumbled feta,paprika quinoa was perfectly balanced, beautifully plated, and was a highlight. Wine list excellent and knowledgeable staff rounded off a great meal.

Friday night of Labor Day weekend: We had a reservation for 6:00 pm. The flight was supposed to have us on our way out of SFO before, or at least by 4:00 pm. But, no. We decided BART would be faster getting into the city than a cab would be, but no. BART electronics must have been affected by the 106-degree heat. We were late getting to Trestle. They were delightful. The restaurant was packed. Service was great. The food was fabulous. It is a a set menu with two choices per each of the three courses. I had a salad, the crisp skin trout, and a delicious fruit sorbet. My friend had the tomato soup, the crisp trout, and a great pistachio cake. Elevators in the airport and the airbnb were broken. The Blue, the Red Line trains, and BART were broken, but Trestle had their act together, record breaking heat or not. Kudos.

I loved everything about my meal at Trestle! The options were great, the food high quality and delicious & the price was right. Way to go! I will visit again when I am in San Francisco! The tortilla soup was nicely prepared with garnishes on the side. My sister and I shared 1 optional add-on: the pasta entree for $10. It was pesto buccati and it was out of this world- the pasta cooked perfectly. When the pasta was served to me, I thought it wouldn't be enough, but of course pasta is filling and who needs to stuff themselves with a gigantic dinner? The fish was excellent and the dessert (pistachio cake) super tasty. There was nothing I would change (except a larger portion of dessert, but that's only because I'm a dessert lover!)

Reservation almost certainly needed on any given night. The menu changes daily, so even with reservations don't plan on expecting to know in advance what you might get. In our particular case, we strategically picked the course offerings such that we were able to try everything that night. The quality of ingredients and preparation is very good. The dining room area is relatively small, and the voices can collectively make for a loud experience. The service was good, if not a bit over-the-top at times (such as verbally listing each ingredient of each course upon serving it). Be sure to request the complimentary bread.

Our group of 5 made our reservations for Trestle at least 6 weeks out, not even realizing it was literally around the corner for our hotel. We arrived and our table was still occupied with the previous diners. The very friendly hostess gave us menus to peruse while we waited, plus 5 glasses of champagne to make our 20 minute wait more tolerable. Overall, the service was excellent and the food was very good, though extremely limited choices (~3 for each course). I would highly recommend going here as long as you're not an overly picky eater.

A prix fixe of $35 is ballsy if you are also going to match that with quality. Trestle does that and more. The food was delicious. There were 3 of us and all of our orders were on the button. The wine that accompanied it was delicious although it was at an eye watering price. Serves us right for not just savoring the one bottle. It is seriously successful so you need to book but oh so worth it

The six of us made a reservation at Trestle because we had to see what the fuss was all about. Fine dining and three courses for $35? The buzz is all true. Fantastic! You are able to choose one of two options in each category and add fourth course pasta for an additional $11. We ordered everything and shared. Too hard to pick one thing because they all looked good! So if you dine as a couple, you can still taste everything on the menu! Small bistro feel with close tables, but still easy to have a conversation and not feel crowded. The menu changes often, but definitely add a pasta to split at a minimum. Best carbonara ever.

This popular restaurant is a breath of fresh air in San Francisco's elite culinary scene thanks to its very fair pricing, good food, and excellent service. One has a choice of two items in each of a three course prix fix menu, with an option for an additional pasta course for $10 more.The service was very friendly and showed a genuine interest in our opinion of the dishes. The wine list is diverse, well chosen, and quite fairly priced.Our only concern was the noise level, which made conversation with dinner companions difficult, an all too typical feature of most new San Francisco eateries.

Visited Trestle last night with friends. Definitely a bargain, with a 3 course meal for $35. Wine list is varied and impressive with many wines by the glass. It is small with tables very close together but a nice ambiance. Presentation of plates is inventive, i.e. the broccoli soup presented with veggies and peppers at the side of the bowl and then the soup poured from a pitcher! Very nice! Between two couples, we sampled everything on the menu. The salad, trout and chocolate roulade for dessert were all delicious. The soup, squid ink risotto and pork were pretty tasteless. Pork was overdone and had a fat-cap that turned me off. The highlight was the hostess, Brittany and the two servers, Stuart and Danielle. They were friendly, welcoming, checked on us regularly and went over-and-above to make sure we were satisfied. The menu changes regularly so we would definitely go back to try again when in North Beach.

One of the few restaurants in SF that you can still get a Pre fix dinner at this price. The restaurant is quaint located border of financial district, North Beach and Chinatown. The food is creative, delicious and great value for the price. A wonderful place to take out of town guests as you can take a stroll through North Beach, Chinatown or Financial District (close to Pyramid building) But make your reservations early, they fill up quick

This is a small place and reservations are suggested. The service was great. We did not have to wait for anything. We enjoyed the appetizers of squash soup and asparagus salad. The black ink risotto was very good, though I would have preferred more shrimp in it. My main course was fish, which was crispy, but bland. The potatoes added nothing to the dish and any other veggie would have been better. This was my major disappointment. Overall recommended, but could have been a bit better.

Concept is pick 1 of 2 options for -Appetizer-Pasta (optional course)-Main dish-Dessert For $35 (without pasta course)Salad and soup were great (tasty and flavorful)Lobster Mac-&-cheese was disappointing and not worth getting (to my taste)Mains were weaker: Pork well prepared but under-seasoned, fish is well spiced but overdone. Still $35 . And they make money on alcohol I guess

I was in San Francisco for business and went to dinner with a colleague at Trestle. We both loved it! The beer and wine list is fabulous. You won't miss cocktails. We had a local sour beer which was delicious. I agree with other reviewers who recommend ordering one pasta course and sharing it. I loved every course. The desserts were almost too beautiful to eat. I had a Thai tea semifreddo, which was among the most memorable desserts I've had. Overall, I highly recommend Trestle and am so glad we had a chance to dine here during a short trip to SF.

There were eight items on the menu tonight. Don't get me wrong, I love small intimate menus but this was an extreme - especially when a three course prix fix is suggested where you can choose one of two options in three categories and then there are an additional two pasta options. You can swap out one of the pastas for one of the mason dishes if you ask. You can also substitute a fruit plate if you would like for one of the desserts.The food presentation was absolutely wonderful and our favorite dish was by far the squash soup. If it is on the menu when you go - pass up the asparagus salad and go with squash. We did have a vegetarian with us and there was only one main dish (a risotto) that she could choose from ... she wanted that so my guess is they could have done something special for her in the back.This place got crowded quick and this is a testament to the quality and presentation of their food. The service was good and attentive. My three rating is more about the variety of plates/choices available and the lack of choices from the menu for main dishes for my vegetarian friend.

Indeed, this is the best value on a special meal out in SF. $45 buys some butternut squash soup, some lobster risotto, a beef shortrib entree (not quite as great as the $36 dish at Monsieur Benjamin, and a somewhat smaller portion, but still), and dessert. $20 Corkage but the wine list is a good value too. Almost too loud for me but I'm sensitive to a loud room. Simple decor, you are paying for the food, labor, and rent, as it should be. Maybe not Michelin Start quality but

Quite small restaurant with a prix fixe menu at $35 for three courses plus $10 for the optional pasta course. Service was helpful and prompt. The whole cost including some drinks and one pasta with service was $60 each. The food was great. I had butternut squash soup. The presentation was attractive. the bowl arrived with the accompaniments in the bowl delicately arrange on one side and they poured in the soup. It was great. Then we shared a pappadelle pasta with mushrooms - can certainly split between two also good. I had the salmon with crispy skin and a deconstructed apple pie for dessert. The food was great, the atmosphere was delightful, and service was good. A really great evening out

We have been wanting to eat here for awhile and finally did tonight. The three course menu is a ridiculous $35. Let that sink in for a moment. Normal restaurants charge $35 for ONE course. We started with the cauliflower soup, which was outstanding, and the chicory salad with bacon lardons and a poached egg, which was almost as good. Then came the pastas: a lobster bisque with shrimp and a mushroom risotto with white truffles ($20 extra). Both were outstanding. The mains were a crispy skin striped bass and truffle-stuffed chicken breast. We added a dessert, the chocolate glazed layer cake, again, outstanding. We had a great bottle of wine for $70. Service was great, as everyone waits on you, not just your waiter. I hesitate to recommend this place, as it only will make it harder for us to return. Incredible value. Great food. Both at the same place? Unheard of.

The other courses were also great - buratta salad, beef shortrib for my husband and I had the salmon. For dessert we had the carrot cake. Everything was perfectly seasoned and beautifully plated.

I'm generally not a big fan of the Prix Fixe menu type of dining. I like to chose and share. This worked out well, with reasonable pricing, attentive service and most importantly delicious food. Book ahead! Room can get noisy, so choose a slower night if you want to have it a little quieter. Wine list has nice options at different price points, and there is a decent glass pour selection as well. Let them know ahead of time if you need dietary accommodations.

I happened upon this place by searching for restaurants near me (stayed at Hilton Financial District). Called to see how long the wait was and was told they would hold a table for me to walk over. Boy, am I glad I did!!! Concept is a prix fixe menu similar to what I'm used to with Houston Restaurant Weeks. Was told the menu changes daily. Every single dish I ordered was superb - roasted chestnut soup, mushroom pappardelle, crispy skin salmon and apple pie - all for $45. Highly recommend to anyone in the area looking for reasonably portioned, high quality food.

In fact we both agreed it was the best balanced, well presented meal we have had since we arrived in the USA ten days ago. We have spent time in LA and traveled via Santa Monica, Santa Barbara and Carmel before arriving in San Francisco. Trestle surpassed all our other dining experiences, irrespective of the price. Their policy of offering a different 3 course menu each day for a fixed price of $35.00 has paid off. Despite the limitation of only two selections per course we both enjoyed our meal. They post their days menu on their web site but you will need to check it out and book. Tremendous value,professional service and well presented dishes. A bottle of French Chablis at $52.00 was more than acceptable. Go, if you can get in!

Trestle offers a three course meal with an optional fourth course. They were started by a team that already runs other SFO restaurants, and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. It's perfect for couples, because there are a few choices for each course, so if each person orders a different item you can pretty much try the whole menu. The menu rotates frequently. Some of our standouts were the tortilla soup (a miracle in a bowl) and some mouth watering pastas. They are a great value for really good food, and worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.

I don't have a bad thing to say except that we took an 8:45 pm booking because we booked that day so if you plan to go in advance, book ahead. Needless to say we probably enjoyed the food all the more for being so hungry !

The Trestle is a small restaurant located on a quiet corner. The menu is a reasonable prix fix menu. Although there are only two choices from each category, the menu changes every few days, depending on what might be fresh.

This is a really nice surprise in San Francisco. The restaurant is in a nice corner place with tasteful design and set-up. Reception was very friendly and we got a good table. The set menu is a positive surprise for various reasons. The prices for the set menu are fair $35. The selection of dishes, yet small is well balanced and the plates have just about the right size. This is for once not the usual US experience where the amount of food has to cover the quality (or lack of it). High quality ingredients, well balanced in a nice dish! Very good. The wine list is extensive and you will find your bottle. The waiters are a bit on the snobby side. They know they work in a cool place and get their 18% anyway. There could be some room for improvement. If possible on TA I would give 4.5 points.

We knew what to expect of the menu, the service, and the presentation. All five staff members interacted in one way or another and made our dining a fine experience. I do think that the butternut squash soup and crispy skin sea bass were monochromatic, but they tasted fine. For me, the highlight was the peach cobbler, an outstanding mixture of fruit and accompaniments. However a huge disappointment came with the bill. With tax and surcharge, our total was $101.40. The food and drinks portion was $90. The establishment not so subtly suggested a 20% tip of $21. That was a tip on the tax and surcharge. 20% of $90 is $18 or a difference of $3. Imagine a group of four with a total of $400. Do the math. This deception not only is unprofessional but also marred an otherwise fine dining experience. Beware: too many restaurants do this--a tip on the tax.

We had a reservation and they seated us right away. The prix fixe menu has two selections of three courses for $35. per person. You can also order the pasta or rice dish for $10. extra. We split the pasta. There was more than enough food for me, I was full. Our waiter was very good and pleasant. My Sea Bass was very good, the skin was very crispy and the meat tender. All of the dishes were plated nicely. The bolognese sauce was heavy, I prefer a lighter sauce but my husband loved it-especially with the melted cheese on top.

The prix fix $35 menu with a $10 supplement for a pasta dish was very reasonable and affordable. I really only liked the tomato bisque and the mushroom pasta. Everything else was underwhelming.

Great to dine as a one time place but I don't think I will dine here again.

My husband and I are in love with this restaurant. It will be our go-to any time we're in the City. Definitely make a reservation, it's a small, noisy restaurant and everyone is eventually going to find out about it because it's so awesome. Service is very attentive, the food shows imagination and is presented beautifully. We enjoyed our courses (my husband went with meat for his entree and I went with fish) and we had to share back and forth so we didn't miss anything. He still wistfully talks about the smoked salmon salad we started with...We didn't order the pasta dish but a complimentary portion was brought to our table from the chef. So amazing! The wine pairing was spot on for our courses. The value of the entire experience was reasonable and well worth it. We'll definitely be back!

My sister in law sung high praises for this place, and so I was excited to try it here in San Francisco. Unfortunately, servings were too small and flavors and seasoning of our "tasting menu", we're practically bite size and averaged Our desert at the end was a tiny donut which was 1/5 the size and goodness of an average Krispy Kreme. Left the place 70usd per head poorer and hungry. Never going back.

Took a early 5:30 reservation. It's a prix fixed menu 3 courses for $35 plus additional $10 if you want to do all four. The categories are appetizer, pasta, main, and dessert. I did all but the pasta. The menu changes. As the waiter said, it's not a certain date it changes, but evolves as the chef and kitchen continues to explore.Portions look small but truly a well portioned serving. I felt full but not a glutton. Wonderful marriage of flavors but for SF, the price was incredible!! The glasses of wine or a bit pricier ranging from $10-15/glass but still a wonderful meal and city affordable. Highly Recommend. My menu choices:SUNCHOKE SOUPSmoked Salmon, Hazelnuts, Goat CheeseBBQ-BRAISED BEEF SHORTRIBGrilled Polenta, Bacon-Wilted Greens, Jimmy Nardello PeppersHUCKLEBERRY CAKEVanilla Ice Cream, Huckleberries, Expresso Crunch MixVery small space but funky and charming in it's own way. It's on the corner of Columbus and Jackson (about a block down heading east from the Columbus Tower). There is not traditional hostess stand. New age with a small ipad type of stand. This place fills up fast and it worked out for us as we did an early dinner to catch a show at the symphony. Take into consideration of traffic if you are ubering, taxiing, etc. Traffic had us a bit late. They still were able to squeeze us in and were extremely accommodating and professional.

Excellent food, great service and a wonderful experience

Perfect Birthday Meal

My husband and I were in San Francisco for one night, on our way to Napa, and it was his 30th birthday. Trestle was a fantastic choice for dinner! There was a birthday card on our table and candles in his dessert. The meal, meanwhile, was awesome! Three courses for $35 is a great deal in the city and everything was delicious. We got one pasta supplement and it was definitely worth it. Great service and food!

The best thing about Trestle, besides the food, is that you don't have to make a lot of decisions. The restaurant, on the border of San Francisco's North Beach and the FiDi, offers a 3 or 4-course prie fixe menu of comfort foods with a sophisticated spin. The restaurant is small, but attractive. It is somewhat noisy, but not so loud that you can't have a normal conversation with your dining companions. The wine list is extensive and eclectic. The service is stellar. During my recent visit, I started out with the ceviche, segued to the meatballs (the highlight of the evening), devoured the sea bass and finished with the brownie dessert. The food was delightful and the portions just the right size. I left feel full, but not stuffed. A return trip is definitely in my future.

Highly recommended making a visit to this restaurant whenever you are in the area. The set menu makes choices of someamazing food easy. The food is exceptional. You can tell there is much care and thought put into it. The location is quaint and welcoming. The service is awesome. My water glass, although a water bottle is set on each table, was always filled and everyone here worked together to make sure you had what you needed. The presentation of the food was terrific.

It,s hard to get a reservation even on Monday, we settled on the 5:30 spot since the rest of the times were full. The place is small, I counted 42 seats? The menu is limited for a reason, they have to be efficient to turn tables but they do not rush you. You select from only two options for each of the three courses and it is $35 per person. Low price for North beach, no? There is a also an available extra for $10 which was totally awesome tasting. The wine list is good and friendly prices, cocktails are also low priced. The foods is very interesting and delicious and I learned that the owners and manager and some of the crew were part of the original Michael Mina's Aqua, which explains the atmosphere and skill level we noticed from the entire crew who were very friendly and efficient. They fussed over us some since we were celebrating our anniversary (we didn't tell them but our server overheard me toasting Happy Aniversary to my wife, wow).Cheers

GREAT PRIX FIXE MENU CONCEPT EATERY

Trestle ONLY serves a nightly 3 course prix FIXE menu for $35 pp. Two choices for each course, which includes appetizers, main course and dessert. Optional pasta course can be added for $10 pp. The food was simple outstanding!! Fresh pea soup, braised short ribs and peach cobbler were my choices. My friend and I split a gnudi (large gnocchi) dish. Each dish was done with tons of flavor, highly creative presentation elements. By the time dessert arrived we were pretty darn full. Service was friendly, professional, and highly efficient.The fact that the small kitchen only has to focus on different eight dishes a night means they can really nail down the quality. Plus the menu changes frequently based on availability of local ingredients, so it keeps the staff from getting bored, I would imagine. This place is a winner. I'll see about giving it another star on next visit.

We had a great meal at Trestle we really like their three course prix fixe menu format.The food had good flavours and textures, dishes really meshed between courses. You can decide to add a fourth pasta course as an option. They changed their menu every now and then as well which is nice to try some variety.The service was informative and professional.

Wonderful service. Great food. Amazing prices. Forget the pretentious presentations, stuffy wait staff and nine course food marathons. Simple food mindfully and interestingly presented by a warm friend staff without New York prices. This is what San Francisco dining should be!! Very limited menu which changes daily but I've never seen a menu where there weren't items I salivated for after reading the description! My only negative is the continuation of the SF restaurant insistence that basic benefits and wages are somehow a 'surcharge.' Trestle is a prime example where management understands the essential nature the staff plays in their success and clearly trains their staff well. To end a meal with a bill showing a SF Surcharge leaves a bitter note. The message I recieve is that given a choice, management would chose not to pay their staff living wages, health benefits, sick days or other essential benefits if they were not required to do so by the city of SF. I can't think of a better example in SF where the staff clearly deserve all the benefits mandated by the city and the cost of those benefits should be included in the cost of doing business.

I don't know what I was expecting, but this was not it; it exceeded all my expectations, except for, perhaps a glamorous atmosphere (it was a little noisy). It is where the Locals eat, so reservations are a must. The restaurant is very unassuming, just a small room that will seat about forty people. It isn't in an imposing location. So what's so special about it; just about everything else.The Chef, Jason Halverson, and the Sous Chef, Justin Ramirez put together a three course fixed menu, which varies from night to night. The beauty is, there are only two choices per course, both of which are wonderful. That way couples can each choose one each,and by sharing, taste the entire menu. Here is the menu for this particular night with my wife and I choosing one of each:Appetizers - Grilled Aspargus Salad and Yellow Corn Soup.Entrees: King Salmon and Duck Leg Confit.Desserts: Coconut Panna Cotta and Dark Chocolate Tart.All of the above was just about as perfect as you could get it. Oh, and did I mention hat they had great wines. Perhaps whites would have been suggested for this menu, but we could not pass up a bottle of Duckhorn Paradux (we had just found this one at Napa Valley the week before, and loved it. The Duck and Grilled Salmon were robust enough to verify our choice.The night was made even better by the great waiting and serving staff. We would highly recommend this place, if you can find it.

Tough to beat the quality and value of the tasting menu at Trestle. Three course prix fixe dinner for $35./person (an optional 4th pasta course is available as well). There are 2 choices for each course.First course was a delicious beet and goat cheese salad and a potato soup (which we didn't have). The pasta bolognese with burrata was very good (we chose not to have the corn risotto). We then had Arctic Char and a roast leg of lamb. The lamb was a bit tough and very bland and the fish dish was very good.Dessert was a chocolate pot au fer and a passion fruit cake. Both were good but neither was exceptional. The menu changes periodically.Five stars for the value. Four stars for the food. 2 stars for the SF penitentiary seating (to be fair, there was at least 4 inches between tables, but people in SF seem to like that).

This does seem to be a good value for the City. Our starters, pasta supplements, and the sea bass main were all excellent. My short rib main and the chocolate mousse deserts were disappointing. Our bottle of wine at $48 was a great value but the wines by the glass program seemed a little pricey. We would absolutely give this property another shot. The servers were all fantastic.I have read some comments on the noise levels. We thought the noise level worked well in giving you a little sense of privacy since the tables can be quite close.

You get what you get but the menu, prix fixe, is exceptional. We had to forgo the desert. It was good I am sure but at that point there was need to go further. Stuart our waiter was on his game. A very young clientel. A group of four max but a couple is best. High energy, exceptional cuisine and presentation. Save time and a reservation for Trestle. It is memorable.

The interior of Trestle is small and sitting is a bit tight, however the intimate setting was fine for me. I dined at Trestle while on a weekend Getaway to San Francisco. The portions were perfect and I was full by the end of dinner. The night I dined the prefix included, split pea salad which was surprisingly delicious, the sausage stuffed quail was perfectly moist and tender, and the sponge cake for dessert was the best part. A 3-course dinner for $35 can't be beat. I would definitely recommend Trestle.

Trestle shows diners a good time with great food for the most part. Don't miss the Garganelli with Burrata! Entrees were also delicious and well prepared. (a small portion but enough) My problem came with dessert. The passion fruit cake was super dense and glutenous. Due to the great prices, the menu can be limiting and I couldn't eat the other dessert selection. I should have asked our extremely helpful waitress for something else...my bad. Also, ask for a quiet table; it got a little loud for me.

We read a lot of good reviews of this place: prix fixe at a relatively modest $35 per person. In actual execution, though, the food was wanting in almost every respect. While the pasta supplement was first-rate, and the main focus of the main dish - a nice Alaska chard - was quite tasty, most of the dishes were too busy and poorly presented. For example, the chard had four or five other things on the plate, confusing our palates. The deserts were a mishmash of various tastes that confused not only our palates but our eyes, because they seemed thrown together on the plate with no thought to design. On top of that, neither dessert was tasty.Sadly, this restaurant showed that for prix fixe, you get what you pay for, and it's apparently difficult to combine prix fixe chic with modest prices.OTHER: Service was very nice, but the room is extremely noisy.

I'm rarely a fan of prix-fixe menus; I like a little more variety, and I don't mind paying for it. But Trestle totally made a convert of me. Yes, a three-course menu is a steal at $35, no matter what the quality of the food is; but the food here will blow your mind -- it is equal to the best the city has to offer elsewhere at four times the price. Make no mistake, this is serious dining here; not the atmosphere, which is fun and welcoming and casual, but the food -- oh the food... I'm a private chef, and former restaurant person, so I can be pretty particular, but I couldn't find a single fault here, everything was perfect. The menu changes constantly, so I can't really tell you what to have, but I will say you should spring for the extra ten bucks for a pasta course, cuz my risotto kicked some serious butt... And one of the owners, who greeted me and chatted and ran the dining room impeccably, was a perfect example of how to treat your customers and present your restaurant. Don't miss this place, it is awesome!

This restaurant has a strictly prix fixe menu which is I found interesting in general. The tables are very close to each other so don't expect a private conversation. Due to the tight space it was quite loud and difficult to hear the servers.The service was excellent and very attentive there were about 7 wait staff for a restaurant that fits roughly 35. The food was delivered at nice pace.Everything I had was delicious with nice flavours and textures. I selected the SMOKED MUSHROOM SALAD, PAN ROASTED STRIPED BASS and CHOCOLATE MOUSSE. Each dish had a uniqueness to them that surprises you, for example the dessert had a cream infused with cardamom. The portions at first seem small but you leave feeling just right and satisfied.

The limited selection, prix fixe menu makes choosing easy, and the $35 price for 3 courses is a terrific bargain. We also split the risotto from the optional ($10 supplement) pasta course, and it was excellent. The grilled bread, available on request, was delicious. My favorite item was the delightful soup. Trestle also has a great selection of beers and wines, with small markups from retail, and a few, carefully chosen wines by the glass. Make your reservations early as Trestle is quite popular. Tables are a bit close and the noise level is reasonably high, but neither detracted from my fantastic evenin.

There are reasons that it is hard to get a reservation at this cool local spot with not many tables located on the edges of Chinatown, Little Italy and the Financial District. The prix fixe meal is extremely reasonable ($35 pp), yet of extraordinary high quality and the service is excellent. When I went there were two selections to be made for each course, and of course I chose one and my girl chose the other so we could have a taste of the entire menu. All were well put together, presented and delish. We also split a pasta at an extra charge which was well worth the additional few dollars both for the taste and to fill us up. Everything was high quality and I will go again.

Trestle is just a deal. The restaurant offers a prix fixe menu for $35 for 3 delicious courses, and for $10 extra you can have their remarkable risotto course. Staff is just the right amount of friendly and attentive. The interior is sleekly modern with wooden trestles bracketing the walls and ceiling. The seating is tightly packed together, but it doesn't feel cramped; and the place is crowded, creating a pleasant din, but you don't feel like you need to shout to be heard. Price, quality, and ambience all pleasantly come together here.

Heard this one of the trendy SF spots to visit and my brother made reservations 2 months ahead. We almost missed our reservation because of traffic and an Uber issue, but got there right as they were giving our table away. Man, are we glad we made it!Prix fix menu with atypical but fine dining fare. Each gets to choose between 2 first courses, two entrees and 2 desserts. For a nominal extra $10 one can add a pasta course and choose between 2 of these. We split 2 between the 4 of us and this was just fine portion wise.The food was way better than just fine. Each course was unique and interesting and tasted great. I had the stuffed quail entree, and honestly wouldn't have ordered it in another setting, but it was fantastic. Both pastas, risotto and a bolognese, were awesome. I would definitely recommend the pasta course, and splitting was encouraged.Great wine list with unusual finds. The service was attentive and friendly and non-intrusive. The room is small, but very energetic and we had no problem with conversation.Great value, Great meal. Great restaurant.

The pre-fix menu is updated daily and absolutely delicious. The wait staff and owner Ryan Cole are engaging which helps create an awesome atmosphere. We left the place around 11 on a Thursday night and it was still alive with energy. The success of another one of Ryan's places "Stone's Throw" has allowed for Trestle to gain attention by association but if you try it out you will find out quickly that the attention is completely justified. This was my favorite meal of my entire honeymoon - surpassing the other 10 restaurants we tried for dinner across 2 weeks of travel. Go check it out!

We went here on the last night of our stay in San Francisco, we had seen it on a foodie website and booked weeks in advance. We are so glad we did, the food is exceptional and amazing value for money. They only serve beer or wine, neither of which I drink but they do offer a couple of very nice ciders. The sweetcorn soup was divine, and the presentation and portions were perfect. The staff were fantastic, very polite and attentive. We had arrived early but the maitre d' recommended a place where we could go and get a drink before hand. We were not disappointed and will defiantly return next time we are in San Francisco.
