Best Breakfast in San Francisco!

I'd go out of my way to go here for Breakfast / Brunch. The location is quiet and scenic considering where it is, and it is great to sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy your food.The food is wonderful, and obviously cooked with care. The options are extensive, and I can heartily recommend the California omelette with hash-browns and sour-dough! I have also never tasted such delicious orange-juice as served here, it is clearly freshly squeezed, and from the sweetest oranges you could wish for.The staff are very friendly and attentive, and it is a real joy to come here to eat. It's great value for the city as well :)

Took a break from the hotel breakfast and landed here. Son loved the chocolate chip pancakes that we had to come back a 2nd day. Pancakes and waffle were soft, fluffy, thick, and good. Eggs were buttery soft. All in all, good place to stop. 

I am afraid it was mediocre

Friendly people but very basic breakfast. Scrambled egg overlooked, hash browns tasteless ,sourdough toast cheap. Bacon was good and crispy. The orange juice was freshly squeezed,but poor in taste.You can see why this place is nowhere near as busy as 8am next door which is a 5* gem.

This is a small local diner near Fisherman's Wharf...a perfect alternative to the pricey breakfast buffet hotel fare. Conveniently located near numerous hotels; we walked here for breakfast twice, and were very pleased with the tasty food, service, and friendly employees. They open at 7 AM. Highly recommend!

Went with 8 friends for a farewell. They got us to order delivered our drinks then told us no split bills. After they started cooking our breakfast. None of us had cash and they couldn't tell us where the nearest ATM was. So instead of spending time together for this farewell event. Our whole party spent 30 minutes trying to find atm's. Some of our party even left without having food. The manager was very unhelpful and only yelled at us because we should've seen the sign hidden behind the counter. Better systems should be in place. The manager didn't understand we actually didn't spend any time together. Ruined our entire farewell with the limited time we had together. An apology would've been great but she yelled instead. Food was okay but half the party was looking for money

Joanie's Happy Days Diner was recommended to us by the staff at our hotel; it was a good recommendation. There is nothing fancy here, but you will find friendly servers and good food. This is a tiny restaurant, we were lucky to get a table. The fare is typical diner food with plenty of good choices. We had a great breakfast!

Missed attempt at Happy Days nostalgia for the tourists.

Breakfasts are a hearty serving. From what I saw, omelets and egg scrambles were hearty servings with the potatoes and toast. But the French Toast servings were a bit skimpy. We dined after the breakfast crowd had already left, so the service was fast and friendly.

We had eaten here on previous visits to San Francisco and were looking forward to again. Quite disappointed this trip. Long wait to get a table. Food was ok, service was rushed. I noticed sign for kitchen help after we ordered. Tables were not being cleared quickly for new customers. I heard one of the wait staff tell a customer they were very shorthanded. We also thought the restaurant may have a different owner than on previous trip. Prices were much higher than on previous visit also.

We walked into Joanie's at about 9:30am for some breakfast. The staff were welcoming and made sure we were all happy and had everything we needed. We all had breakfast burritos, which did not disappoint. They were huge, much too big for our tiny British stomachs, but they tasted amazing and made sure we weren't hungry for our day out in the city! Only fault is the cafe is a bit small and the tables are quite close together, and could definitely be more colourful! We would definitely visit again and I hope I can try more of the food on the menu.

What a wonderful place to start your day. Our family of 4 were quickly accommodated and seated on an outside table, and found the service was brilliant.The menu offered to cater for many types of breakfast and we ordered pancakes for our children and hot oatmeal with extra strawberries and blueberries for my wife and I. We had tea, coffee and hot chocolate for drinks.The meal was pricey but freshly made, filling and in pleasant surroundings. Going back there for the rest of our stay.Try it.....it's worth it.

We stumbled across this place while trying to look for somewhere to grab a bite to eat before our scheduled Segway tour. The place is dirty and the tables are extremely close together. Each time an employee needed to get something from the drink refrigerator, my son would have to stand up and push his chair in so that the employee could reach in the refrigerator. My husband ordered a "ham, egg and cheese on an English muffin"- $10.99I ordered the "vegetarian scrambled"- as it seemed to be the closest thing to an omelette that was offered on the menu. $13.99 I was only able to eat about 1/2 of it, as it tasted like someone scraped all the "leftover" eggs on the griddle together, and then threw in a couple of veggies. Kids both got breakfast burritos $13.99 I believe- they reported that their breakfast was good.Three of us drank water, one had a coffee and a milk.Bill was $66 and change....so with tip, this was a $75. breakfast. You read it right.

We had a good, tasty breakfast at this restaurant. Service was speedy, 3 ordered pancakes with fruit, 1 Belgian waffle, 2 orange juice and 2 coffee. And yes, three side orders of bacon, 3 slices each .Fruit was exceptionally fresh! We opted to eat inside as we were not accustomed to the chill ( 60 degrees and breezy). Restaurant is clean and pleasant. Portions were not overly large or filling. The only down side to the experience was the cost. After the meals tax, and gratuity, there was another tax. This tax of 4.9 % was added on to defray the cost of the new CA legislation raising minimum wage and requiring employers to pay health care. After all that, the bill was just over $100. Made Mc Donald's and Starbucks look pretty good. I just chalk it up to an interesting experience.

We have spent nearly three weeks travelling around Canada and the west of the US, and the breakfast we had here was the best one ever. Joanie's is not a big restaurant, and is very friendly, welcoming and obviously popular. I had a Belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit with a squirt of cream, freshly squeezed orange juice and as much coffee as we wanted. The waiter came up five times to see if we wanted a refill. The bill was very reasonable, and I would thoroughly recommend Joanie's and would love to revisit.

We stopped in here with some friends who had eaten here the day before and liked it so much they wanted to come back. That was a good sign already! We ordered breakfast (omelet for me and eggs benedict for my husband) and received so much food. The hashbrowns were delicious, the coffee was good, and the service was great! They brought us our check but made a point of telling us there was no rush to leave. We appreciated that! It's fairly priced and we would eat here again.

We stayed at the nearby Marriott & was looking for a good breakfast within walking distance. Our concierge recommended Joanies just a couple minutes away. He gave us a business card which entitled us to a free fruit plate as well. We liked it so much we had breakfast there all 3 days of our stay! The menu has a great selection & the portions are huge. The staff is attentive & our coffee cups were never empty. It does tend to get busier later in the morning and the inside seating is tight. There is street seating as well which is comfortable if the weather is warm enough. The breakfast burrito is huge with lots of options and most egg dishes are made with 3 eggs. Pancakes or waffles with fresh fruit were also great. Good place to get a filling meal before hitting the city!

After a walk down Lombard Street in the early morning, we were all pretty hungry. We wandered into Joanie's just because of the fact they had food. Boy, were we in for a treat! They cleaned up a table for the three of us, and when a group of 7 asked, we were politely asked to switch tables. Soon after that we were brought a complimentary bouquet of fresh fruit. And then the actual food came. Amazing portion sizes and wonderful service - not disappointed at all!

We decided to go past the eight am this morning and try Joanie's. Good selection except for the fruit plate. Charge extra for berries and bananas so I think the fruit plate is either canned fruit or just melon. The hash browns were a bit greasy but I enjoyed the egg and bacon on a bagel that I switched out for an English muffin. My husband liked the eggs with lots of bacon and home fries.

We had breakfast at Joanies on a Friday morning a little after 7:00 am and we were only one of two couples there, which scared me a little, but they did only just open at 7. We were greated immediately, welcomed, and were offered a nice seat at the window. Would have liked to sit outside, but that San Francisco morning chill was too much for me. I had coffee, and it was perfect for my taste - strong and delicious. We shared a Breakfast Burrito with sausage, and it was more than enough for the two of us - four heavily loaded pieces, one whole piece went back to the hotel frige to be enjoyed later. We both thought it was delicious. The staff was attentive, the food was great - served promptly and hot, the atmosphere was cozy. l really liked the place. By the time we left, most of the inside seats were filled. I don't know why they don't get the same crowds as the 8 AM or the Hollywood Cafe get, maybe it's the name.

Had breakfast here earlier today. A tad worried we were the only customers for a while but that soon changed. As an earlier reviewer mentioned it does look like a "greasy spoon cafe" but as with so many back home they serve the best breakfasts. Interior is dated and was cold inside on our visit.I had a sausage and cheese muffin which was so much nicer than a golden arches one. My fella had a waffle with fruit which was huge and tasty. Coffee refills appreciated. Overall good food but a tad overpriced.

We first visited this diner 7 years ago on our first trip to San Francisco from England and we're delighted on our return trip to see not only was it still here, but just as popular and the food just as amazing. The service is very friendly and although the decor needs updating, it's the food that makes us return most days. We've tried other places, including IHOP for breakfast, but they were not a patch on this place. We leave incredibly full and satisfied that we've had a good quality meal and very reasonably prices. I'm kinda glad I only get to come here when we visit San Francisco cause I'm not sure my waistline could cope if this was on my doorstep!! If you're looking for a decent place for breakfast or lunch, this place is a must visit. Trust me, you will not regret it.

When you discover a place on a 10-best-in-the-neighborhood search, and it turns out to be as good as rated, you feel really good. (A happy day, I guess!) We gave Joannie's a try because the cafe advertised in the hotel magazine didn't look that appetizing at first, so we looked for something near Fishermen's Wharf where we planned to spend the morning. We're very glad we did, because Joannie's is absolutely wonderful! (The cafe near the hotel turned out to be nearly as good, but that's another review.)Our breakfast was served quickly, exactly as ordered, beautiful in presentation, and delicious to taste. And given its location a couple of blocks from Ghirardelli Square, one might have expected premium prices, but Joanie's are quite reasonable. I could not recommend them highly enough!

damn good food

We found this breakfast place on our way to another place. We were able to grab a table outside on a beautiful fall Saturday morning. I had the Pacifica egg dish with shrimps and spinach. It was served with potatoes and toast. My boyfriend ordered a veggie omelet with potatoes and toast. Both were very delicious.The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We never entered, so not sure about seating or restroom situation inside. The food was plentiful for the price.

We were recommended to go there by some other guy and we were not disappointed. The omelette was so good with a great choice whilst you watch the people go by.The staff were very attentive and although it was not right on the bay, it's worth a visit.

We visited this diner for breakfast one day and lunch for another. The prices are very good for being close to Fisherman's Wharf. They give big portions of food. I had a belgium waffle for breakfast and it was delicious, loaded with fruit and some whip cream. The service is quick and friendly and the meals came out fast. I highly recommend this diner if you are visiting. It is not a big place inside but they do have outdoor seating.

Great breakfast spot!

Small place not far from Fishermans Wharf. Good breakfast menu and the food was very good. Can get busy and as its quite small a queue can build quickly in the morning. Well recommended.

Not much atmosphere, but it's the tasty food that counts!

We printed a Groupon for this diner, and it wasn't busy when we decided upon a late lunch. They close early but agreed to serve us. I had the most beautiful waffle piled high with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, whipped cream and a side of syrup. It looked too pretty to eat, but every bite was delicious. Hubby chose to eat a burger and fries (how boring) but he was satisfied with his choice. Portions here seem to be large and satisfying. Based on our experience and other reviews, I would recommend this place.

Great food, small diner

The food here is plentiful and tastes great! During a busy season you can wait in upwards of an hour to get a table because the dining room is the size of a large bedroom. Worth the wait.

Service was just so, so. Ordered poached eggs and the came out hard boiled. My husbands omelette was okay. I would not bother to go back.

We walked past this restaurant several times a day. My son wanted to try it because, it's always busy and that's a good sign. The staff was more than accommodating for our large group and even asked a smaller table if they wouldn't mind moving over so we could all sit together. Food was great, service was quick and responsive. Portions were more than enough. They close around 2:30pm, which didn't seem unusual with a lot of restaurants in the neighborhood, doing the same thing. They have a great selection of items to choose from.

Great staff with great breakfast (girlfriend's meal). Reasonably good chicken Sandwich with Average fries (myself). Definitely recommend French toast with bacon. Next to sightseeing tours so handy location. 

Chose this for breakfast due to great reviews

We wanted to experience Breakfast in a proper Diner and saw this had a good rating on TripAdvisor so decided to test it out for our first Brekkie in S.F.Well worth a visit - great choice and a bustling place. Beware, it is a tad small, you may have to wait for a table and they are on the cramped side. Can't fault the food - choice, quality and speed of service.

Joanie's offers well prepared breakfasts at very reasonable prices and good service. Place is not fancy but a great way to start a day of touring the San Francisco Bay area

My husband and I have just had breakfast at Joanie's this morning. He says it's the best coffee he has ever tasted! The food was served piping hot by very attentive waiting staff and was delicious. No need to worry about where we'll be having breakfast for the rest of our stay in San Francisco!

Excellent start to any day

We ate here twice while staying at HI Fishermans Wharf across the road and it was great both days. The first day we were up early due to our flight the previous day and ate here at 8am and it was very quiet. Food was good and fresh, nice poached eggs and kids loved their pancakes. We ate again on day three around 10 o'clock and it was packed with no seats inside (outside too cold!) Only had to wait about 10 mins, this time we ate breakfast burritos, bagel and eggs with bacon. Food was served quickly bearing in mind how busy they were and again was delicious. If you are staying nearby go and enjoy this authentic diner at reasonable prices. We paid about $50 for four of us. 

Phenomenal breakfasts!! You won't need lunch after these breakfasts!!

We were staying in the Courtyard Marriot Fisherman's Warf right across the park from Joanie's and the desk recommended them to us. We enjoyed our breakfasts so much, we went back again the next day.Very fast service, always with a smile and thanks for coming in. We had pancakes, french toast, waffle, and combination breakfasts. All were abundant, reasonably priced, with quick and pleasant service.

Great breakfast with less touristy feel.
