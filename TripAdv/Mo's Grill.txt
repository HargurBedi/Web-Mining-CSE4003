Breakfast was okay

Went here for breakfast based on the reviews. The food was okay. Originally I ordered pancakes, but they would not heat up any syrup, so I changed to eggs and toast. The eggs tasted okay but they were coated in oil or whatever they cook with. The waitress was very friendly, but the cook seemed offended that I asked for heated syrup. Would not recommend.

This is an unassuming little restaurant on Grant Avenue in North Beach. Grant Avenue has a lot of history and is an interesting stroll in any event. But along that street (East side) you will find Mo's. When you look in the big front window, you will see a large, round, rotating grate over a charcoal fire -- perfect for burgers which is one of their specialties.I go there for breakfast -- as do many, many North Beach locals. When you step inside you will see large bags of potatoes. That's because one of their specialties is home-fry potatoes and that's why I go there for breakfast! They are perfectly cooked with a nice crispy exterior. Combine that with perfectly cooked eggs (any way you like them), bacon or sausage, and perfectly toasted whole wheat -- you then have the perfect breakfast! Like pancakes? They have those. Like fresh squeezed orange juice? Yep! Do you like quick and friendly service? Then you'll like Mo's.Look above the entry door when you are inside and you will see a big poster of the Three Stooges. The rest of the decor is heavily oriented to cows! They have a counter which seats perhaps 10-12 patrons and about 10 tables. There is a wait on most weekends but not nearly the wait you will see at Moma's (which is two blocks away). I actually think the food at Mo's is better than Moma's.Mo's has an open kitchen and you typically see 3 short order cooks working their magic at incredible speed. You can wait for your bill at the end of your meal or just walk up to the register to pay. It's a small place so the intelligent staff keeps track of everything.

I'm not sure what all the raving here is about. Maybe we were there on an off night. My son and I were excited to try Mo's legendary burgers but they weren't anything special.

Place serves classic diner fare. We both got omelets. Mine was just OK, kinda flat because it only had bacon in it so maybe that was my fault. Potatoes were super good and we asked for them well done so they were extra crispy. The fresh fruit was a nice mixture of different kinds. Now the OJ..... bomb.com!!!!! So fresh and awesome, worth the price.

I didn't want to say this is the best restaurant or food I have ever had because I have been in restaurants in Paris for example, that cost $1500 for dinner. But I have to say, if you want the experience of basic American old fashioned comfort food; this is the place for you. Everything they do is the best of the genre. From hamburgers to meatloaf to milk shakes to apple pie; this is as good as it gets.Mo's is the best of it's type.

Mo's burger's on Grant Ave, is not a chain. Each burger is carefully weighed and the meat quality is top notch. the burgers are grilled on a slow spinning grill over lava rocks. Any food at Mo's is good and I have never had any meal that was below a 100% satisfaction. My favorite burger by far is the French Burger. if you like goat cheese, this is the burger for you. the goat cheese is stuffed in the burger....yummmm.The fries are also good. Heck, as I said everything is good. You must also try their shakes.....to die for!!!!!!!!!They also serve breakfast. Their omelets are huge too.

We found Mo's via Tripadvisor and must say we were not disappointed. It's a little off the beaten track when compared to the more tourist areas around fishermen's wharf but well worth the effort. We visited four times during our ten day holiday in San Francisco for both breakfast and lunch and were always welcomed by the waiting staff even at very busy times. We had breakfast pancakes and omelettes, burgers and salads and all were delicious,the Very Good salad was well named and burgers were the best we ate in SF. The Toilets were also clean and tidy.Well done Mo's.

I can't recommend this place highly enough if you're after a good honest burger in SF!

Stopped by with two girlfriends on a Saturday morning around 9am. The coffee was magnificent, the potatoes are TO DIE FOR and the eggs I had over easy, along with thick, smokey bacon... I couldn't be more impressed. The wait staff was AMAZING. The smiliest group of ladies, that made us feel so welcome. They filled up our coffees and waters regularly and even remembered that my friend was drinking decaf.It's definitely not fancy - it's a diner feel. But it is ADORABLE. You won't be disappointed. Make sure you get something with potatoes.

 It was a Monday morning and we were looking for a place to get breakfast before heading out to the airport. We were walking the sidewalks of North Beach and finally stopped a local woman who was walking in the opposite direction; asked her for a breakfast recommendation. She steered us to Mo's, about two blocks from where we were at the time. We are so glad she did. Breakfast was great. Service was friendly. The place was packed. The only (very small) nit - they were so busy, there was a line of 5 waiting at the cash register to pay; and apparently the only person able or allowed to run the cash register is the single server for the restaurant.

We arrived at around 9:30am on a Saturday morning and were seated immediately. When we left, there was maybe a 3-5 minute wait for a table, if that. Food was your standard diner breakfast. Large portions though, so good for them. No complaints. Save yourself the hassle of one of those wait an hour type joints and go here. You won't be disappointed. No idea why it is called Mo's but they did have some Three Stooges memorabilia on the wall.

This place is TINY. I'm guessing it seats maybe thirty people at a stretch, including the spots at their breakfast bar. We went with a party of seven around 10:30 on a weekend and had to huddle awkwardly by the door until we were seated, maybe a 15 minute wait? The line was out the door by the time we left. It was *completely* worth the wait! The food was amazing, and I'm sort of a tough audience. My husband is a foodie and we've eaten at fancy restaurants and dives all around the world. We chose to eat family style, ordering a big variety and passing dishes around for everyone to try. For me, and for two other people in my party, we're pretty sure that was the best pancake we've ever had. I got the french toast and it was amazing. The only thing I didn't love was the orange juice. It tasted a bit off to me, but it could have just been a bad day. They also served their soft drinks in cans (no regard for the environment or free refills). Still, if I were a local, these people would know my name! The food was really top notch. The service was decent, any shortcomings were just because the waitress was clearly serving everyone. I'm a huge breakfast food snob, and I had an exceptional meal here.

Went here because the Mama's line was too long. Inga seated us right away and was on top of the water and coffee the whole time. Just when I thought I needed some more coffee she was there, like she was reading my mind. Had the eggs and spicy sausage which was good but was really floored by the Eggs Benedict, stole some from my friend who ordered them, and their pancakes. The sauce on the Eggs Benedict was different and very very good. Can't explain it properly but it was REALLY great. The pancakes where just out of this world and I honestly wished i had ordered the blueberry pancakes. I don't eat pancakes often as the carbs and calories, but when I do I want them to be out of this world, and Mo's did that for me.Will come back again.

We came here upon the suggestion of a local whom we sat next to during the Italian Pride/Columbus Day parade. We'd asked her where to go for breakfast and she said that Mo's is where they always go. It was a $6 Uber ride from our hotel at Fisherman's Wharf. The breakfast is good and hearty. Nothing fancy or overly creative, but very good. My son had chocolate chip pancakes (I tried a few bites - wow was their batter really good!), I had scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions (very good), and my husband had the benedict (excellent hollandaise). The service was fantastic and the coffee was the best we had our entire trip. The grill is small, only a few tables. Glad we tried it!

Came here for breakfast on a recommendation from the hotel. This place is small and cozy and has a lot of character. The first thing you notice is the rotating grill and they turn out some amazing meals. I had the Aussie Burger which contains - ham, bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, hamburger patty (freshly ground and made on premise) and two eggs on a soft, fresh bun. It was AMAZING! We also had the breakfast burrito - which the size of a forearm covered with chili and salsa. It was amazing. The next day, while we wanted to go someplace else, we just couldn't. So we went back and I had the eggs with the spicy pork chop. That thing was delicious. All the prices are reasonable ($10-$14) and the service was outstanding. I travel to SFO a couple of times a year and will certainly make my way back to Mo's.

There was one table open, so in we went. Our breakfast was fabulous. We had eggs benedict, eggs Florentine, and pancakes. All three were delicious and huge portions. The breakfast potatoes were so great-- perfectly browned and crispy. Service was fast and friendly. Very reasonably priced too. Enjoy...

As we walked in the door at Mo's I noticed a pan of home fries on the rotating grill and knew we were in for a treat. The service was great, the food was great and the portions were large.

Burgers were cooked perfectly to order, we tried a good shake, lots of really good options on the menu. Loved the cow art decor. An enjoyable evening. If we were living in San Fran I expect we'd go back often.

Delicious breakfast

Holy tacos was this breakfast delicious! We found this place following the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel. Such a fantastic recommendation! The food was abundant, delicious and reasonably priced. The OJ was freshly-squeezed and to die for!! We will definitely be back on our next San Francisco trip. 

Best Omelette to start the day off right!

We ran into Mo's looking for a healthy breakfast. We had two awesome, huge omelettes with fruit. The italian omelette had so much sun dried tomato! Normally you expect two or three little strips, this thing was packed. Also when they say something has avocado, you get half an avocado! Grest prices, huge portions and a small neighborhood feel! 

Huge breakfast!

We luckily ran into Mo's while we were looking for a brunch/breakfast on our last day in San Francisco. It is a small diner and there might be a short wait but it was worth it. Had the salmon (lox & cream cheese) omelet with the skillet potatoes--these were really good. This is a really big dish. We also got an order of the bacon pancakes. Mmmmm. Good.Didn't order one but the burgers look really great.

This place is tucked up a side street, find it at all costs, proper homemade burger but you wont be able to eat it all if you have fries, it was great service, clean and seriously delicious, I'm not usually a burger person but it was outstanding

Great burger in San Francisco

Mo's was recommended by the girl at the box office of Beach Blanket Babylon. North Beach is known for it's pricey Italian restaurants which we were not craving. This was a hit. I had the Western burger which was abundant in all it's fixin's. The beef itself was very tasty. Mo's takes pride in the fact that they grind their own mix of ingredients and it tastes like it. It was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. My friend ordered the chili with a side of fries. Also very tasty. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to fries and these were right on target with crispiness and the amount of salt added. We were told they also had great shakes but were so full after our dinner, we couldn't partake in dessert. If you're in North Beach and aren't in the mood for Italian food ... this is the joint to head for.

Good, yes, but not as life-changingly awesome as some are saying

Mo's Grill in North Beach is a small burger joint that makes a pretty decent, abundant sized burger that they cook in front of you on a rotating flame heated grill. The burger was good, and the fries also crisp and tasty. It struck me as a bot pricey, in that we dropped almost $80 for three burger meals.The atmosphere is somewhat cafeteria-esque. There are paintings of cows on the walls, with one looking in through the window, and another with the back half of the cow actually sticking out of the wall. It's kind of humorous. The wait staff was very friendly. 

One of the best burger I have ever had

This is by far one of the best burger I have ever had. The meat is cut and prepared in front of you, and the other ingredients and toppings also well prepared and seasoned.French fries were good, the only regret is that they couldn't add an egg on top of it.BUT excellent and would go back. Try the Volcano Burger and add mushroom to it. DELICIOUS

Wow great size

Small, but nice burgerplace! I ate tex-mex burger and it wasnt too "hot" for finishgirl (there was of course some chili to add, i you like more hotter-one burgers) The restaurant was a little bit cold (but i think i would be great thing if there is more warmer day..)

Great Burgers in A Cozy Restaurant

There is one restaurant in San Francisco, which my wife and me must visit, whenever we come back to the city by the bay: MO`s GRILL, a cozy place in North Beach near Chinatown, which simply has the best burgers in town. I tried the Blue Cheese Burger, my wife had the California Burger, both were excellent, juicy, well tasting with good beef and fresh ingredients, mouth-watering and delicious... we had two other burgers the next time, and I guess, all the burgers there are just great - and they also have a good beer selection - you can also watch the cooks create this wonderful food - you can sit on tables or on the bar - I fully recommend this place, but for dinner come early, because many people know about it and stand in line...!

Can't miss breakfast, the most important meal of the day!

My husband and I always make an incorrect turn or two trying to find our favorite breakfast spot near Washington Square, I know, just google it....I love that it is on Grant Ave. so much to see and explore on the way and while you wait. Often a wait but thank heavens its short enough and always worth the wait. While waiting you can watch the cooks on the griddle and "try" to decide what you want as you see the platters go by. Speaking of platters, most of the dishes are huge and easy to share, or better yet take some of their hash home for another meal. Its very cozy, not fancy, but soooooo good. We are bound and determined to come back for one of their burgers...Oh my, they looked incredible. Beats mama's for food, service and certainly the wait! 

Saturday Morning Pancakes!!!!

I'll tell you the truth. I haven't wanted to let anyone in on how good Mo'sGrill is because I want to make sure I can still get in on Saturdays for my weekend pancakes!!!! It has always baffled me why people stand in a 2 hour line to get into Mama's a few blocks away when Mo's has the tastiest breakfast in town. I go a little crazy. I have the blueberry pancakes with a side of the louisiana hot link. The combination of sweet and spicy gets my Saturday mornings off to a delicious start! The place is small and it can get busy...but the waitresses never rush you and keep the hot strong coffee comin' -- so good and ultimate comfort food!

Delicious

We walked till we found the right spot for a burger. Not many of them in North Beach because there all an amazing amount of Italian restaurants in North Beach. Could tell from the window as we passed.. the best circular grill with buns and hamburgers cooking , mmm we're going in. The best, the best, hamburger I have eaten in the best of times...... Go eat there if you are in the area.
