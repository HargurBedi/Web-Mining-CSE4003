Not much to add to the other glowing reviews other than to suggest sitting at the counter as close to the back as you can for the wonderful floor show put on by the cooks. Poetry in motion -- plus you get to see all the things you wish you want next time. We had the scallops, and each perfectly prepared dish would have fed both of us. Very small, no reservations, so be there by 5:54 or be prepared to wait.

Wow! Sotto Mare was Molto Bene! They were so great to accommodate us when we switched the number in our party from 6 to 4 and back to 6 because of uncertainty of flights due to smoke at SFO. But last minute all our friends arrived safely and with a 15 minute tweek in time we made our reservation. And reservations are a must because the restaurant was hopping at 6:45p. Unfortunately with 6 persons you must sit downstairs because the tiny restaurant's main dining room can only tolerate a maximum of four persons at a table.But once seated the beer & wine was immediately served and the fun started. We ordered 3 wedge salads (one with Bay shrimp) and 3 orders of Crab Cioppino and each couple split. It was more than enough and at $50 a couple plus drinks a real deal. And YUMMY.We had a terrific time and will return. Definitely recommend.

Wonderful Italian Seafood. My husband and I tried the crab Cioppino, plenty for two people. It did not disappoint. He also had the clam chowder which was delicious ,very thick creamy and full of clams. We were seated downstairs "under the sea". I recommend calling ahead for reservations as they get very busy.

This is a seafood restaurant--with outstanding food. Had the clam chowder and clams--very generous portion and taste was incredible. Prices are very reasonable for San Francisco--that is why there is always a wait for the restaurant. They have only a couple of two top tables so you may be seated at the bar but the bar is used for serving food as they have wine and beer only. There is no other choices but seafood--so if you have someone in your party who does not like seafood there is one dish pasta with garlic and oil. The person next to me ordered cioppino and it looked terrific--I will try it the next time. Staff is very very friendly.

First off, if you're not into seafood pick another spot. But, if you're after one of the best seafood restaurants in SF, this is the place. The cioppino is the gold standard by which you will measure all others. This is a great neighborhood spot. Seating is limited and they only accept reservations for parties of 3 or more. So, be prepared for a wait unless you get there by 5p. Our server was very friendly and attentive. I also recommend the baccala appetizer, which is different from the standard offering and very tasty.

So glad our tour guide recommended this wonderful eatery in the North Beach area. Gave us a chance to experience the Italian neighborhood and to enjoy unbelievable seafood. Wait was definitely worth it. Plus the lobster light for table available allowed us to enjoy a cocktail at the great neighborhood bar across the street. Crab with pasta was so sweet and fresh. My husband had a great piece of fish.

This place came highly recommended for its reasonable prices and fresh seafood.This restaurant is located in the "Little Italy" area, is quite small with indoor and outdoor seating.We arrived at about 4:30pm and were seated at the bar facing the staff in typical American diner style. By 5pm they were quite busy and they don't take bookings for 2 persons as it's first come first served.We had their speciality which is the Crab Cioppino with seafood and serves two persons. This is done in a tomato broth and is basically the seafood catch of the day. This comes served with fresh bread and butter.I enjoyed my meal with two Bud Light beers.My wife is a seafood lover and enjoyed this San Francisco specialty.A very good seafood cafe with reasonable prices.

Soto Mare is a very friendly and excellent place. The food is wonderful. We had raw oysters to start, and also oyster shooters with Peroni beer on draft and Proseco, excellent. Then their Bacalav, which is and Italian salted cod dish with a red sauce, it is unbelievable good. As a main course I had the crab with garlic, you get the crab cracked in this delicious garlic sauce and pasta on the bottom, simply delicious and they have the best Chopino with all the sea food you can imagine, this is a sharing dish, it's really big for one person. Excellent. There is no dessert or coffee, so you go out and there are so many places close by to have dessert or just coffee. The service is really great, they are so friendly that they make you feel like family Delicious and excellent.

Amid a scene that at times is reminiscent of a Marx Brothers film (think the stateroom scene in A Night At The Opera) Sotto Mare's cramped kitchen turns out lip-smacking uncomplicated Italian seafood-based fare in more than ample portions. This sliver of an eatery, just off busy Columbus Ave., has a dedicated following among locals who mingle seamlessly with tourists and the helpful and sometimes funnily sharp-tongued staff. It all adds up to a great experience for everyone except those bereft of a minimal sense of humor. Enter hungry and you'll leave sated and with a smile. The menu is short and there is nary a dessert on it. The locally baked bread that cones with each meal is delicious as are the oysters, New England clam chowder and all the pasta and seafood dishes. We passed on the very popular cioppino, said to be the best in town, intimidated by the size of the single serving, which is replete with seafood and nearly fills to the brim a bowl as big as some kitchen sinks. The wines are harmless and drinkable. The tables for two inside this elongated room are barely larger than a chessboard; the few outdoor tables seem somewhat larger. Sitting at the long counter seems to be preferred by many regulars. Bottom line: a fun place to enjoy an honest plate of pasta and/or seafood that should please in taste, quantity and price.

Sotto Mare lives up to the hype. We went to Sotto Mare for dinner with family to try their legendary Seafood. First I would like to say that Sotto Mare does allow you to bring your own wine for a small fee of $10 per bottle and do not make a big fuss about it. The restaurant is always crazy busy no matter what time of year which speaks for it's self. It's a long narrow spot with lots of pictures on the wall telling you about the family and history of the place and on the other side is a long bar with fresh fish and windows to watch your food being prepared.Sotto Mare is a classical Italian Seafood restaurant that lives up to its reputation in every way. You come for the fresh seafood and you leave happy. The Cioppino is amazing, a wonderful tasty broth filled with a variety of Seafood. I would recommend one order for two people as it comes with bread as well.I'm sure if the rest of the menu is as good as the cioppino you will not leave hungry.

This is a classic North Beach restaurant. Small, crowded and noisy but excellent seafood. The cioppino is messy but delicious. (Comes with a bib). There is lots of crab as well and the usual seafood. The sauce is what makes it special. Oysters, clams, and mussels are also good as is the seafood pasta. Lots of food so go with a crowd and split the dishes. No air- so since its small and crowded can be warm on warmer day or night and service is subpar but the food is great.

This restaurant is a must in San Francisco. It gave us the seafood experience we were looking for. A man walking by made our choice easy for us shouting out Cioppino!

Our waitress must have had a long day as she was not helpful nor pleasant.

For two of us, one of us had great food - just fabulous, the other had an entry that was bland and disappointing but prices were moderate and service was fine. We would certainly go back.On a Monday night we got seated immediately at the counter which runs the length of the narrow restaurant facing "the kitchen" (which runs the length of the place on the other side of the counter). There are 5 tables for 4 and 2 tables for 2 along the wall but otherwise all the seats are on the counter - maybe 20 or 25 at most on the marble counter where you watch the cooks at work. I had the Smoked Salmon Fettuccine which was totally superb - absolutely delicious and memorable, a rich cream or perhaps creamy cheese sauce over the noodles and smoked salmon which was not a solid piece of salmon but broken smoked pieces - but wow such a treat - rich, smokey and so tasty, just wonderful at a very reasonable price ($21) . We shared a crab cocktail to start - shredded crab over lettuce - and that was nice but the feature was the smoked salmon. My wife had the scallops which were nice, large, and tender, and not bad but were bland and nothing close to the wonderful smoked salmon fettuccine I had. It was ordinary not special and was served with a pile of cooked greens that were tasteless, perhaps a bit bitter, and which she did not eat (called rapini - it was like young immature broccoli but mostly leaves and stems, not the floret heads like broccoli). To be fair there were some (huge) slices of carrots with it that I ate for her but those greens neither of us found palatable in the least. Since her scallops were nice and tender but with little flavor outside the norm and her vegetable was just, well, yuck, she was not that impressed. So just don't order this and order the smoked salmon fettuccine instead, which was to die for. A lot of folks evidently also liked the cioppino for two, which is a seafood stew but full of mussels and clams and other seafood in the shells that I would never want to deal with. It is popular there but never ever would I want to deal with the shells (and I don't much like mussels and clams to start with). The carafe of white wine was great as was the bread, the crab cocktail, and my meal.I like raw greens in salads, but why any restaurant would serve cooked greens is beyond me when rice or potatoes, asparagus, beans, peas, corn, or even squash would be so much better to my taste and there are many ways to make combinations like corn and beans and salsa so interesting (or try green beans, feta cheese and walnuts). There are so many wonderful vegetable sides cooks can make but boiled greens, give me a break. I regard wilted, boiled (or steamed) green leaves as inedible but worse these were totally without imagination or culinary taste to accompany otherwise very good scallops that were bland in seasoning to start with. For a top rated restaurant in a major city our rating is mixed - from great, the very best for my entry, to totally disappointing for the other. Good thing the house wine was good.Service was fine, we left a nice tip and would go back but would never order anything there or anywhere else now served with rapini.

We had to eat there two times in a day. For lunch, we had the cioppino (really good, enough for two) with a side rapini. Total plus tips was $56 USD.

We were seated at the bar and watched all the actions behind the counter.They don't open on Sundays. Saturdays are busy. We were turned away on Saturday because of the lineup (We went around 9pm).

What a fantastic feast of seafood. The Crab Cioppino was the bomb!! It had great flavour and plenty of seafood. The swordfish was cooked well. The lettuce wedge with blue cheese sauce was better than I thought it would be. Be warned, the place is popular with long wait times and only a small restaurant. It does have an additional area downstairs "under the sea" which is a quieter area

Sotto Mare was highly recommended by locals and it lived up to its rep. The service and atmosphere were great, upbeat and attentive. The cioppino was the best I've ever had. You know the seafood is fresh when there's ZERO FISH SMELL in the whole place. All you can smell is the tomato-based heaven that is dinner. Crab, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, squid! I left the pasta and bread behind because why fill up on fluff? Wear the bib, use your hands and make sure you wear dark clothes. It's full contact eating! LolTwo giant thumbs up!

We walked up from Fishermans wharf on a hot August night, were seated straight away and ordered IPA and Sangiovese to compliment the Cioppino special of the house!Fresh crusty bread and the ambience set up the sight, then the smell and taste of the shared bowls, with all the seafood perfectly cooked. A zingy flavour that tingled the tastebuds, it is still Nonna's recipe in a timeless dish that honours all that is good about Italian cooking and sea food. Yummy!Our best meal in the States after a month travelling!

Nice, cozy place that is always busy. Made a reservation on Saturday and well we did as waiting line started just after 530. While the place is busy, staff is friendly and helpful. Had crab, oyster/clam shooters and clam chowder. All was very good. Mains were pasta - one with bay scallops the other with seafood. All was good just a tad cream heavy. Last dish were sauteed scallops and it was the clear winner. Succulent scallops cooked to perfection with cooked vegetables.

My wife and I went here for lunch. It is a small place (basically has a bar service area and then a line of tables running parallel to it). The clam chowder was great. I am a big fan of Boston clam chowder and this was the best that I have had in years. Not too thick and goopy like many places seem to make but had plenty of body. A bowl with some french bread was a perfect lunch. The couples on either side of us were having the cioppino (it only comes as a "for two") and I could tell from their comments that they were really enjoying it. All in all a great place for a bit of seafood in an old San Francisco style eattery.

This place is so popular and has thousands of reviews, but please, stop expecting something to sweep you off your feet. This place is small, but very cozy.

Enticed by the very good Tripadvisor reviews we went to Sotto Mare on a Tuesday evening. It was 6 pm and there already was a waiting line. After about 30 minutes we got seats at the "Chef's counter". It was fun to watch the chefs preparing all the dishes. But our clothes smelled strongly afterwards. As starters we had the house salad and oysters. The latter were very delicious. Best dish of the evening. The house salad was extremely boring with a heavy cocktail dressing which seemed not to be housemade. As a second course we had Linguine al Pesto. Unfortunately, the noodles were drowning in heavy cream. (I never had heavy cream in a pesto sauce in Italy.) As main dishes we had Rex Sole, Scallops and Prawns with seasonal vegetables. That was very disappointing. Lots of oil and butter but nearly no seasoning. If you are looking for great oysters this would be your restaurant but I wouldn't recommend the other dishes we had.

Oysters were fresh and there was a generous amount of seafood (crab, mussels, prawn) in the cioppino. However, there was also a fair bit of penne pasta in the cioppino that my dining companion said wasn't there when he visited about a year ago. Unlike other restaurants, you have to stand in line and wait to be seated at the bar (it's usually first-come-first-served elsewhere). Also, the restaurant holds your credit card after you've put your name down on the waiting list.

The food and drink lived up to the billing. The prices were reasonable and the service was very nice. We had a party of 10 and were seated at a table that was very reasonable size. The cioppino was wonderful. It is noted to be for two. We split it among myself, my wife, and our 12 year old daughter and it was perfect. For a San Francisco highly rated restaurant, this place was a very good value.The only reason we gave it a 3 was the heat. Each person was visibly sweating due to the sweltering basement area. It was cool outside but brutally hot down there. The quarters are cramped but in a pleasant and fun Italian restaurant sort of way. However, the heat was a deal breaker. I think had we had a smaller party or sat upstairs, this would be a 5 star review but we all agreed it would not be feasible to go back given the heat down there.

I had a recommendation from my tour guide about this place for seafood. The place is a long shotgun style building and they have a bar that runs the length of the place. It is decorated with lots of large stuffed fish and pictures of people catching fish. I was having lunch and was by myself and they seated me at the bar. I started with a cup of clam chowder. In my opinion it was good but not great. However, I had the swordfish as my entree, which was one of the lunch specials. It was cooked with lemon butter with capers and the side was Swiss chard. I can unequivocally say that the swordfish was the best I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth with the lemon butter. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was comfortable. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

I was skeptical. I've always been disappointed when people tell me a restaurant's special dish is life changing and I have to try it. That's been the case until I went to Sotto Mare.I often associate most mid-range American restaurants (maybe unfairly) with having overly generous portions, over salted or under seasoned food, and generally having one-note dishes. Sotto Mare changed all those expectations. We ordered the clam chowder, crab cioppino, and a grilled black cod dish for three adults. The clam chowder had great depth of flavour - smokey bacon, brine and meaty texture of the clams - and it wasn't overly rich. The black cod was simply grilled, but had a lovely sauce and well cooked veg. The cioppino.DAMN. I'd go back and eat that cioppino once a week if I could. It was packed full of seafood and wasn't overly salty. After we ate all the pasta, I went back and drank all the sauce.I called one day in advance to make a reservation, which I highly recommend, but they don't seat your party until everyone is present. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We were seated in the basement, which was actually a relief as it was much cooler and less frantic than the upstairs seating area.

We were here in July to celebrate our anniversary. I have heard about this place for a few years, but had not had the opportunity to go. It was spectacular . . . and worth the wait for a table. As it happened, we ended up at the bar beside the kitchen, so we got to see many dishes prepared before making their way to hungry patrons. The cioppino is great, but I am looking forward to returning to one of the other fantastic dishes that we saw. It's too bad five stars is as high as I can go.

The two of us split a house salad and cioppino. The salad was a salad, not bad, but the cioppino was really good. Other ratings say the best in the city but I can't say that because a lot of Italian restaurants serve cioppino; at least 50% of the patrons had cioppino, so that speaks pretty well for Sotto Mare's version. The wait was not unduly long, the service was excellent but the noise level was high. We ate there 3 years ago on our previous trip and loved it then too!

I went there for dinner on a week night, solo. Thought I wouldn't have to wait for long, but hostess told me I'd have to wait for 40 minutes. But I ended up waiting for an hour, and I had to share table with 2 other people. The hostess didn't suggest that, but we had been waiting for too long so we asked the hostess if we could get the table and we would sort out how to split the bill. I enjoyed my company.I ordered the sand dab with a side cup of clam chowder. One of the new friends ordered the cioppio, and he let me tried. It was so delicious, so full of flavour! But the portion is large enough for at least 2 people so go there with friends and family. My clam chowder and sand dab were not bad, but they paled comparing to the cioppio. Be prepared to queue for a long time if you really want to go to there for dinner. I probably won't go again unless I can get a reservation.

This is the kind of no-nonsense restaurant that captures the homemade feeling and serves top sea food. With a large counter to watch the cooking and small tables on one side, plus a few outside, it is the perfect place to just relax, have a nice glass of Prosecco and enjoy the incredibly fresh meal, whether the chowder, the salads, etc. It is a simple restaurant but the food is more than that. They are known for the crab cioppino for a reason: generous portion and wonderful. the oysters also, so fresh, and the risotto de mare one of the best I have ever eaten. I will be back. Heartily recommended. Prices quite reasonable.

Great Northern Italian Restaurant. Great Seafood. The Cioppino for two is probably the best in the city but can't go wrong with any of their seafood.

Not a very large restaurant but excellent seafood. We dined here on our anniversary and had an excellent experience. The food is outstanding and the service is fine. We will be back next time in San Francisco.

I had read many reviews that Sotto Mare serves up some of the freshest and tastiest seafood in SF. The food didn't disappoint! The seafood pastas were delicious, and the portions were generous, with proper proportions of seafood in the dish (they aren't stingy). However, I was underwhelmed with the restaurant itself and the service. The restaurant is small, cramped, and loud. The servers can hardly get by without bumping into your table, which makes the experience feel frenzied, rather than enjoyable. I ordered a drink and a soup, neither of which made it on my plate by the end of the dinner. Overall, I commend Sotto Mare for their tasty dishes, but wish that the layout of the restaurant could be improved for dining guests and servers!

Family of 5. We went there for lunch and were amazed by the delicious food there. Simply the best italian seafood we have had in years and clearly the best since our time in Sardinia! Go with their specialty blindly. A must visit while one is in San Francisco in my opinion.

No even a knife for desert for the rest of our bread and butter. They don't have dessert. The owner answered me back when I asked her for dessert menu, "we don't do dessert, there are a lot of places around here for dessert "This was our dessert

Went in for our anniversary dinner after being recommended by a friend. Got a seat right away without a reservation. They were steadily busy but not swamped. We were even a little early for dinner since we ate a late breakfast and no lunch.The food came pretty quickly. Chowder was good. Bread was pretty good. Entrees were very good. We both had one of the daily specials (different).However, we had to ask for water even after our food had gotten there. We thought it might be a rationing thing, but other tables were getting it delivered automatically. Then plates were cleared the second the last bite was taken. (In the case of a side salad, even before the last bite!!) The bill delivered PROMPTLY with no question about desert or another drink. 3 times before I could get my credit card out, by 3 different people, the check folder was picked up to see if I had put my card in. All this and they were less busy when we left than when we walked in!! We were seated for way less than 1 hour, and trust me we got the message. We were NOT lingering.The restaurant is very loud, not from music, but from kitchen sounds. It almost had the feeling of a greasy spoon diner with orders being shouted along with all the requisite kitchen sounds. It was pretty hard to have a conversation with just us at a 2 top!Bottom line, the food was very good, but we felt that we were getting the bums rush for no good reason. Maybe that SOP here, but it will be a factor in a decision to go back here.

I love cioppino and Sotto Mare did not disappoint. It's definitely a dish to split because it's far too much food for one person. We walked away so full and happy. Would absolutely go again if we lived in SF.

The Sotto Mare seems to be well known for its down-to-earth seafood dishes and they delivered. Very good crab and scallops pasta. Seating is ok, yet not very stylish. Choose outside table if possible. When calling them to make a reservation we were told that reservations would not be taken for tourists. A bit ridiculous...

Sotto Mare is very popular, but the two of us were seated quickly, even without reservations, which are a must for larger groups. Excellent seafood, large portions and a lively, fun atmosphere....all for a surprisingly low price. We WILL go back the next time we are in SF.

Soto Mare only takes reservations for three or more. There were only two of us, so we had to wait for a while to get in. When we were seated, we sat at the bar...which was fine. We ordered Cioppino to share and salads. The salads came promptly but the Cioppino took a long time. The waitress explained that it usually took a while. Anyway, the atmosphere is fun and the place is crowded. Prices are on the high side ( but this is San Francisco). We enjoyed the meal and would probably eat here regularly if we lived in San Francisco.

Exactly as it should be in every way. It defines what it is in pure authenticity. A unique experience somewhere in between a lot of things, but in its own space for sure. Might be the personality, the charm. Perhaps the tenor, the merry din. But for sure the well prepared and served delicious food. In North Beach this place is the real deal.

Every time I travel to San Francisco I have to dine at Sotto Mare. The food is always good and the staff are great. We had the crab cioppino this time (serves 2) and took out leftovers and bread. Every time I've been here people are waiting to be seated but the line moves pretty quickly. One winter night we were all crowded inside the door waiting and the owner passed out wine glasses and poured us red or white wine to keep warm.The ambiance is casual with a mouth watering scampish aroma in the air and open kitchen. Small dining room with table and counter seating and a few outdoor tables.

I went to Sotto Mare this evening and here was my lineup:6 Pacific OystersClam ChowderCrab DiabloOysters were awesome. Clam chowder was ok - I am from New England and we don't use corn starch in the chowder. The Crab Diablo... AWESOME. It was like the best linguine with clam sauce with big pieces of Dungeness Crab. It was literally the best seafood pasta dish I have ever eaten. It is a Monday and the wait was 45 minutes - worth the wait. I can't wait to go back!

Funny how these small restaurants can figure out how to squeeze enough seating to get the most of the area they have. This place does great with tables and counters. We were walking around San Francisco and we wanted to eat at a place that had good seafood and was Italian and my husband found this place. On the menu it said the Crab Cioppino was enough for 2 and boy it was. Lots of shrimp, crab legs and calamari plus pasta with red sauce. Red sauce had a little kick but very good, not cheap though. But we went for lunch and it was so much we didn't have dinner. Services was great but the hostess not so much.

We came here based Trip Advisor reviews and they were right. We share "the best crab cioppino" it was great lots of crab plus mussels, shrimp and squid. The place is small an I am sure there would be long waits at dinner time.

Staff were terrible. We knew it would be a wait and were flexible. But when we were told it'd be an hour and than 20 mins, and than no longer than two hours that was enough. It's either an 1 We hour or a 2 hour wait. It determines whether you wait or find somewhere else. The communication was terrible! At least the bar next door were accommodating until we decided to ditch this disrespectful establishment of sotto mare. Seriously, how can something be rated so highly with no respect for customers?!We got the call that our table was ready two hours later, but we went to Panta Rei restaurant instead earlier. They were accomodating and the food was great, for Italian.

Worth the wait. Go here right now and eat!!! It is THAT good. Many places give huge portions, and many places give you high quality seafood, but this is the first place I've been that gives you huge portions of high quality seafood and at ridiculously low prices. Our waitress Carmen was on-the-spot. This place was jammed packed and she made the time to check in several time and to ensure we were happy and had what we needed. Entres were about $20 each and none of us could finish it all. Soooo good! Ciopino had to have an entire crab as well as lots of other seafood and had the best base we have ever tasted. Crab diablo over pasta had an entire crab. I had halibut and it was flavorful and cooked perfectly, and they accommodated my dairy allergy by using just olive oil. Loved this place!

We were told about this place by a friend who's a local. Glad we had the crab cioppino and halibut. Sat downstairs where it was a little cooler. Upstairs was super hot from kitchen. We were party of four so called in advance and made reservation. No wait for our table! I would go back.

The Ciciopino was fantastic. Reservations are a must and they won't seat you unless everyone is there. Be early and be there. It is a small, noisy restaurant. Be prepared. Wear something you won't mind getting food stains on. Of course, that might just be me. The scallops will amaze you. There are two public lots that are a block away from the restaurant. Look for the Central Police Station, the lots are right there.

This is a casual, unpretentious and delicious restaurant. You definitely need to make a reservation or you'll probably be in for a long wait, but it's worth it. The seafood is super fresh and prepared with great skill. You should definitely start he meal with some raw oysters, west coast, of course. After that everything seems good. My wife, who is gluten-free, was thrilled with the seafood risotto, and I joyfully worked my way through a huge full-portion of crab diablo. Our college athlete nephew was all smiles with his smoked salmon pasta, and it even filled him up. Not a single complaint in our party.

Arrived at 7:00 on Saturday night and calling it busy would be an understatement. We waited about an hour and 40 minutes to be seated. They don't take reservations for parties fewer than 6. Once seated it took another 15 minutes. Grand total 5 minutes short of two hours from arrival to seeing the server. Given how good the food was, it was perfectly fine. We were away for a few days. No rush!The Cioppino was outstanding with lots of seafood and just a little pasta. As it should be! The dishes at the people sitting around us were beautiful and looked delicious. The restaurant is BYOB so bring your favorite wine and enjoy. 

Good place to eat. Make reservations first.

My cousin and I dropped in here when we saw it was a popular place. We were told 20 minute way, but about 35-40 minutes later is when we were finally seated. We were bumped from our place by people who, "frequent the place and are known by the owners." SO. With all that in mind it was fun to try once but I don't imagine I'll ever go back. The food was fine. Nothing spectacular. Nothing that you can't find somewhere else where you won't be bumped.
