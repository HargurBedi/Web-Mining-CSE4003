There's a lot of options here so there should be something for just about everyone. The burgers are great. You have a choice between beef, bison, turkey, or veggie as well as multiple toppings and a few different bun options. The fries and soda was pretty good as well!

Best Bison Burger outside of the Rockies

I love bison meat. Especially a deliciously grilled bison burger. I've had my shares of outstanding burgers in Wyoming, South Dakota and Colorado where you can always find a good spot that knows how to grill bison meat. I never imagined California. And, San Francisco? This place just floored me with the quality of the meat. The bison is from southeast Wyoming, organic and grass fed! Wow, having this quality of burger cements why I am willing to pay top $$$ for a gourmet hamburger. This place is worth traveling to for several visits. I'm already planning and looking forward to coming back! This was so good, I did not take a picture. Next time

We had 4 very different burgers with very different sides. Everything was delicious. The service was really friendly. It is only a shame the seating is "grab it" rather than table service. So we missed a good table before we knew the rules. We sat outside under heaters and that was great in the end. If they did table service it would have been perfect. But once you realise it's just high quality fast food it's pretty stunning. Takeout should always taste this good.

My husband and I visited this place on a recent trip to San Francisco. We thought the burgers were delicious, and enjoyed the wide variety of options we could choose. It was definitely worth an uphill hike from the Marina Inn. I also like my burgers pink on the inside, and I was glad they had that as a choice as well.

Roam Burgers offers a nice choice of burgers that are well prepared with great sides (sweet potato fries, zucchini & onion haystack). We ended up paying $92 for 3 burgers (beef, bison, wild boar), 1 salad with small burgers, 2 side dishes and 4 drinks. Pretty expensive, but overall worth the money.Service is very friendly as well, so overall well worth a visit.

We had been to a Roam restaurant in another part of San Francisco but were not near it this time. However we discovered another Roam on Fillmore St and so we went. After waiting in line to order, a number is given and we sit at a table. Soon the food is brought. Selections of various toppings are given upon ordering - an area for filling up glasses with water is nearby. Hamburger was very good. Veggie burger was outstanding - not at all like the frozen boca burgers many restaurants serve. All in all a nice place.

We went to Roam based on Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed and pleasently surprised. My wife, three boys and I had different burgers and all loved these crafted burgers as well as the fries. Also good to have different types of drinks menu and the family enjoyed the different limonades while i emjoyed one of the crafted beers. All for a very fair price. Ordering was at bar and delivered very quickly. Very convinient for our Lombard St Motel.

Prior to visiting San Francisco, I researched best burgers in the city as my 15 yr old son is a cheeseburger fiend. Roam was consistently recognized so we made a special visit on a Monday afternoon after Alcatraz visit. He had a plain cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake. Loved it. Said it was the best burger he ever had. I had the salad and sweet potato fries. The salad was huge and could not be finished. The sweet potato fries were excellent. Food was prepared just as ordered and delivered to our table in a timely manner. It is a little pricey though - our lunch ran $38. However, well worth it if you want quality. We visited the Fillmore location 3 days later to get another burger prior to leaving SF. Definitely recommend.

This burger was good. We came here for my Birthday. I only eat a couple burgers a year, so I try to pick a good place. They offer all kinds of fries which are hand cut, and organic milk shakes to top it off. The grassfed burgers are flavorful, and the style at the restaurant is unpretentious. My only complaint is I really like a good toasted bun, and this bun was a bit soggy. Not sure if they always do it like that, or if I just happened to get a soggy bun. All in all, I've had better, but I would come back.

This is a simple restaurant: burgers and fries. And beer. Maybe some salads. If you don't like burgers, then you should go somewhere else. That said, the varieties are endless. They have gluten-free variations, vegan variations, turkey burgers, bison burgers, chicken burgers, and of course, beef burgers. And they have multiple varieties and toppings for any tastes. This was definitely worth a stop in.

The sweet potato fires were amazing, and the atmosphere was really nice. Nice small town neighborhood just adds to the magic of this sensational spot!

We visited Roam Artisan Burgers for lunch during our visit in SF and it was one of the best choices we could have made! Every burger that we tried was delicious and big enough to full your stomach. There is a variety of choices in burgers (beef, turkey, bison, veggie and elk!) and in buns (classic, whole grain, gluten-free). The "Heritage" burger and the "Seasonal" stood out from the...crowd. There are salads and side dishes (potato fries, sweet potato fries and zucchini-onions, try all of them). And don't forget to have a milkshake as a dessert! I am still thinking about those burgers, thousands of miles away!

I'm always looking for the perfect hamburger and when Zagat's or some other noted reviewer ranks a place as one of the "best", I'm there. So when in San Francisco, I tried the #2 Zagat rated (San Francisco Best for Burgers) Roam Artisan Burgers in Cow Hollow. Now I'm a purist, so I don't go for burgers all gooped up with crazy toppings, bacon jam, aioli this and that. Just give me a classic burger with onion, lettuce, tomato, pickle, American cheese (yes) or sharp cheddar. The final test is a bun that holds together until the last bite, and of course beef that is cooked medium rare and has some kind of flavor other than ground cardboard. Fries on the side, of course. So the verdict? Roam passed the test for me with a few qualifications. The bun was excellent. It held together quite nicely and was very tasty. The condiments were more than sufficient, but not to dominating. I prefer my condiments on the bottom rather than the top, but that's just me. The patty, though flavorful, was a little small. I would say maybe 4 oz., where I think 6 oz. is the perfect burger size. It fit the bun, it wasn't medium rare as requested and wasn't very juicy contributing to the integrity of the overall sandwich experience. Overall, I wouldn't rank this in my top 5 burger experiences, but think it fits in my top 10. I would go back and give it another try, but have several more on Zagat's list to try. Good luck Roam!

I've been to a lot of burger places, and this is up there as one of the best. The food is the highest quality I've had in a burger restaurant. Seasonal menu items based on organic local produce, including salads. The menu on the wall includes the sources of the current meats. You can choose from four burger patties (beef, bison, turkey, vegetarian) and then a selection of burger styles or customizable. The french fries are very good, though not the best I've ever had, but the sweet potatoes and fried onions are excellent. Gluten free buns or lettuce wraps as options. Extremely tasty burgers. The atmosphere is nice--lots of wood, interesting places to sit (like the bar). There's good beer on tap. The service on my most recent visit was very good. There are lots of intangibles here, too: a big silver keg of ice cold water sits out, they have their own-label hot sauce in addition to other condiments, etc. The prices are a little bit above the norm for burger places but not for restaurants serving this quality of food. (I would expect about $12 - 14/person for burgers and fries.) I've been twice--once three years ago, and now yesterday on a return visit to San Francisco, and it was as good as my memory recalled. This is a very legitimate contender for my pick of exactly what a burger place should aspire to.

Roam is pretty consistent with the freshness of their food. The turkey burger or smaller turkey patties that you can order to put on top of the Farmer's salad taste great. I wish I knew how they made turkey taste that good. The fries are always good and the shakes look amazing even though I haven't tried one yet. They serve beer and wine. If you have kids, you can take them to Roam-lots of families eat there because there are some decent kid options.

Artisan Burgers is correct for the food, but the place does not allow you to really enjoy the artistry. Order, find a place to sit or wait standing awkwardly in the middle of the room and receive your meal. As a European I would call this a fast food 'restaurant'. I guess by taking the Starbucks' approach of having the order go over too many people, they can slow food delivery down to claim they are not a fast food place. Look again at your quality and the lack of restaurant feel in your place, I would say.Food good, organisation and ambience bad.

I'm a Food Network fan, and I'd seen Roam Artisan Burgers on a show called "Best Ever..." and they were on for best turkey burger ever. While I was in San Francisco, I knew I had to check this place out. I looked up the address (there are two locations), and the Union Street location was a short walk from our motel.It wasn't busy when we got there, we had many seating options, and we decided to sit outside on the street, which was nice. The patrons and the servers were very friendly, and the menu was easy. You choose your burger, what style you want, and what sides/drinks you want, and they give you a number and bring the food to your table when it's ready.I got the turkey burger, done French and fries style (with truffle parmesan fries, gruyere cheese, avocado, caramelized onions, watercress, and Dijon mustard) on a sesame seed bun. This burger was the juiciest, most flavour packed turkey burger I have EVER tasted in my life. If you're a burger fan in general, I'm sure you'll love this place! Check it out if you're in the SF area.

After eating various burgers all over on my holiday, from the Bellagio to in and out burger I decided to check this place out.I loved the hipster feel to the place and its commitment to getting away from the traditional burger menu raw materials.I loved my burger and the process in selecting it and the fries are fantastic. Yes, it's a bit more expensive than most places but everything is locally sourced etc.Definitely a place to hang out if that's your kind of thing. Very hipster / Shoreditch London vibe to the surroundings and menu.

Although the food is locally sourced etc. the hamburger was small, dry and tasteless. The side dishes were better. I would have given it 3 out of 6 stars for flavor but I lowered to 2 because the price is so expensive for what you get. I paid $24.00 for a hamburger, a veggie side dish and a milkshake. For that price, I expect the hamburger to be really good.

Would you like your burger to be a beef patty, or perhaps free range turkey, or bison or elk, or vegetarian? You can get a great selection of choice here. The burger was outstanding. It tasted great. You must get the fry-fecta - a combo of their three types of fries - regular potato, sweet potato and zucchini. This is the only place I've ever been to that has managed to make their sweet potato fries crisp. The truffle oil on the fries was an amazing taste - so good. Service was really fast. It is difficult to get a table here if you arrive at a peak time. The shakes are delicious (I had a mixed berry) but they are too thick to drink - you need a spoon to eat it! They also had a good range of craft beers and wine available.

My family and I decided to try Roam as we had planned our trip to California and this was voted the top 5 burger joints on Food Network. We all agreed that it was worth the visit, they have 5 or 6 types of meat selections (beef, turkey,venison etc.) and there fries are amazing as well as there shakes. It is costly but worth every dollar. If in San Francisco this place is worth spending the money.

When you have had too many McDonald's burgers, this is definitely place to visit. Atmosphere is quite laid-back, service is friendly and it's over all nice place to crab something to eat.

Tasty burger!

The burgers are big and delicious! We went on a Sunday evening, lots of people and as soon as you're finished they take your plate to make room for the next client

A must in SF for burger lovers. I definitly will ask for the Bison meat againg. The Cola is very good and the best of all is that everything is made in a artisan way.

Yum!

Vegan friendly burgers alongside beef fat dripping ones! Not just a good burger but fantastic one and craft beers to wash it all down. Tip: order the fry-fecta to share! 

Excellent take out service..and great burgers!

Roam had been recommended by the owner of our rented condo and was conveniently just round the corner. We used the online ordering service which allowed every item to be hand picked to create a totally custom burger. It work perfectly and the food was ready within a couple of minutes of the selected pick up time. The burgers we very tasty and well prepared. Fries (potato and sweet potato) and side veggies were excellent. Drinks, including beer and wine, are available too. Roam has tables for eat-in and it was very busy at 7:30 on a Tuesday evening but a take out and a few beers at the condo worked well for us. Highly recommended.

Flavourful fun burger spot

We visited this restaurant on the recommendation of a neighbouring business. We tried the bison burger, turkey burger, and a beef burger. We started with the appie trio, had a couple beer, and soft drinks. Quick friendly service with an upbeat attitude. The staff are very proud of the food they were serving, and they should be. A great burger joint. 

Awesome

Pretty close to the best place you can go for a burger while in SF. They offer a great selection of ingredients and toppings to customize your burger with, I highly recommend a visit.

Great ambiance and I was able to get a spot sitting on Union Street. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you, so it's pretty casual. This was my first time there and I wasn't sure of how it worked, so I neglected to pick up water, silverware and napkins which were not on the table, nor were they brought out with the food. Because I was travelling solo, I asked he server who brought my wine to get me some water, which he did, but seemed a bit hesitant to do so. I ended up having someone watch my place when I went back in to get napkins and silverware. I had a turkey burger, which was good, The burger itself could have used a bit more flavor, but the arugula and other toppings made up for it. 

Perfect burgers

I went here for a casual dinner on a recent trip to San Fran. They do a lot of takeout business but the dining area still had a decent number of people when I went there early on a Friday. You essentially build your own burger here: choose a meat, toppings, bun, and sides. I chose a Heritage (bacon, fontina, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo) bison burger wrapped in lettuce with sweet potato fries which was delicious! Next time I want to try the elk! They serve beer and wine there too which is a nice bonus.

Thank the seven gods for Roam Burgers!

My friend's cousin that lives in San Francisco brought us to the restaurant and boy I am so glad he did! I will never look at hamburgers after tasting their Heritage burger. It was perfect! I wish they'll open a reestaurant in Toronto!A must if you're ever in San Francisco!

In the mood for a good burgers with tasty toppings that are paleo-friendly and organic? Try this cozy place out. Small but wonderful menu. I was a little surprised all burgers don't come with fries, but then again it caters to a different palette. Wine and beer selection available. 

Awesome, juicy burgers

Loved the burgers here. Juicy and flavorful. I had beef but they also have turkey, bison, elk (new), and veggie. Great fries, quick service, tables inside and outside on the sidewalk.

Very good burger! Sloppy in all the right ways. Try the sunny side... Nice casual and affordable. Bring the kids! Invite the neighbors, or just take the neighbors kids.

Delicious burgers, fries, & milkshakes! The salads looked good too :-) We sat out front & our food was brought to us in no time. There were heaters that kicked on once the sun was down. They have beer /wine and a specialty sodas. We took a cheap Uber ride over, then walked along the Union Street shops after dinner. Definitely worth checking out!
