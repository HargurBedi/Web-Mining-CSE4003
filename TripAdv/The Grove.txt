We ate at The Grove on our first day in San Francisco. I had heard about this place but didn't realize it wasn't a full service restaurant. You order at the counter and they deliver the food to you. The staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and very good. My wife had the Apple chicken salad and I had the grilled cheese with tomato. We sat upstairs and people watched. I really liked the casual vibe of the restaurant. There were tables, coffee tables with high back chairs, booths. Just sit where you feel comfortable. We will be back next October and we will definitely stop in.

We ate dinner in The Grove - one of the many restaurants in the close vicinity of our hotel recommended to us by our tour manager - we weren't disappointed. We found there to be a decent selection of vegetarian options which is something of a rarity in the USA we found, ranging from the Lasagne to Mexican options - we shared a Quesadilla and enjoyed the draft craft ales on offer. We experienced great service when ordering - really quite chatty and showed a lot of interest in us as tourists from the UK and also from the server who delivered and cleared our plates - they seemed to have time for people.

A Lovely Place to Grab a Casual Bite

The Grove was great! The portions are large and you are definitely getting your money's worth. The food was delicious! I highly recommend getting a salad if you love balsamic vinaigrette dressing for their dressing was out of this world. I have never had one so tasty before! Everything we had was delicious and there are tons of options for everyone to enjoy. Also, BREAKFAST IS SERVED ALL DAY! So if you're a breakfast for dinner kind of person this is perfect! It is not a standard sit down and be served. You do have to go to the counter to order, but once you've placed your order you can sit back and relax as your food is brought and dirty dishes cleared. The staff is very efficient and even though it was crowded our food was on our table in under 10 minutes from ordering. The atmosphere was beautiful and I definitely suggest going at night because they have beautiful fairy lights illuminating the room.

Good spot for vegetarian options and meat eaters as well. Avocado egg sandwich was yummy when I added some hot sauce and a nice cup of fresh berries. My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and seemed happy as well. You order at counter but refills of coffee are table side. Very friendly service.

This is a very busy place for breakfast and we have been three times. The first two times we order the standard combos and things went well. The menu is big and very CA. The place is very lively and there can be a line. Don't worry the line moves fast. Except for my request for crisp bacon all the food was very good. The third time, we wanted a light breakfast so I ordered two poached eggs and toast ($7.5). The eggs were overcooked and cold. I sent them back and they came back the exact same way. Called over the manager and he took them off the bill and made them right. The lesson here is that you stay with the menu and everything is reasonably priced and cooked right. Go a la carte and things get messy and expensive. We will go back and stick with the menu.

Found this restaurant as I walked back to my hotel. I was looking for a place that would be quick without getting too fancy. Didn't want a sandwich or burger, just some comfort food on a cool evening. I was greeted at the door and he suggested the short ribs. The atmosphere was warm and cozy. I took his suggestion and had the best short ribs I've ever had. Served with veggies and mashed potatoes. The menu had everything from enchiladas to ribs. I'll definitely visit again when in San Francisco.

The doorman at Hotel Zelos had recommended The Grove on our previous trip to San Francisco, so there was never a question of where we would have dinner our first night back in town. The chicken pot pie is so good.....and so big! DW and I barely could finish it and we were hungry! The Grove is always busy, but the food comes out fast. We've enjoyed their breakfast and dinner and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves southern comfort food.

I really dug the eclectic decor of the place. Throw pillows, giant trees, twinkle lights, great food and helpful staff. If you're the type who wants this all tidy and perfect, you might want to look elsewhere, but if you want great food in a cozy spot, check it out. I went for lunch and then brought my husband (who needs all gluten free) the next day. It did not disappoint. There's likely to be a line, but never fear, it moves quickly and seating seems to open up when you need it.

I had a basil and goats cheese omelette and jasmine tea. All very nice flavours and good portions - not ugly huge but not small. Pleasant and helpful service from all the staff and a nice general atmosphere even though it was very busy when I arrived. Good price and nice music playing the background - James Taylor then a bit of jazz. One criticism - and in this day and age it's inexcusable: no non-dairy milks for coffee - so no almond/soya or coconut cappuccino for me :( but I let them off because their jasmine tea was incredibly tasty. Would definitely seek this place out again. There are at least 2 in SF.

After reading very good reviews about this place, we had breakfast here on our last morning in San Francisco. The reviews appeared to be true! The price quality ratio is on the high side however and combined with the fact that you have to wait in line and order at the counter yourself, this is the only reason to give 4 instead of 5 stars.

The granola served here is home made and comes with really tasty fresh fruit and either yoghurt or milk. They also do a range of breakfasts such as toasts, eggs, sandwiches etc and teh portion sizes are huge so this will keep you going all day. There is often a bit of a queue but that is probably because the food is so good! there are a couple of leather chairs which are extremely comfortable if you are lucky enough to find them free. If you want reading material there is a range of magazines available at the back.

This is a place where you will place your order, find an empty space to sit. They will call you when your food/beverages are ready. Takes a little bit for them to prepare the food, don't go during the peak hours if you do not have time to spare.The restaurant has both indoor seating (both traditional table and open seating around a large "coffee" table) and outdoor seating.I tried the Chicken Pot Pie (take-out).

We visited The Grove for breakfast a couple of times during our stay in San Francisco as it was a short walk from our hotel. We had the French toast, eggs benedict Dave's way and the breakfast burrito - all were really good. We did queue outside the first time we visited, but it moved fairly quickly, and once we had ordered, we didn't have any issues finding a table. Worth the queue - would recommend!

Went for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday morning while we were visiting SF for a weekend. The Grove was conveniently situated across the street from our hotel and came recommended by the hotel concierge. We showed up both mornings around 7:55 for a 8:00am opening; the lines started so after we arrived.Food: menu is sort of a "breakfast all day" with omelets, scrambles, traditional American and Mexican offerings, plus sandwiches and salads. All looked pretty healthy. On Saturday morning, I had the "Denver Scramble" - which came with some toast on their signature bread (like a French roll) with hashbrowns. The scramble was tasty. On Sunday morning I had their homemade granola with an apple-chicken sausage. The granola was very yummy. Not the best breakfast I've ever had, but certainly a good, healthy choice in the city.Service: efficient. You get handed a menu by the greeter as you are walking in and then order up at the counter. They give you a number and you place it at the table and a server brings your food up when it's ready. All other stuff (water, condiments, etc.) are self-serve on the side.Patio is dog friendly! (No surprise, being SF)Good healthy choice...check it out!

We went for a weekday breakfast at about 9:45 expecting to have a good quick meal. Nope. What went wrong? This place is so disorganized! They didn't have any teapots for tea until we were half way through our meal. Really? Making hot drinks should be a no-brainer at a breakfast place. When our food came - after watching the eggs getting cold while the waiter milled around looking for our table (we were upstairs at the counter so we got to watch him weave through all of the tables inside and on the street), one of the orders was wrong. By the time they'd fixed the order (solution: carry the eggs to the kitchen and back, then bring the correct side dish later) the eggs were genuinely cold. Gross, but not worth sending back because we were tired of waiting by then. Finally, my daughter had the cinnamon roll bread pudding which she found heavy, bland, and generally not good. We definitely would not go back.

Despite both Yelp and TripAdviser saying The Grove was open until 11 PM, at 10:15pm we was asked quite curtly while waiting in line to put in place our order, if we were planning on ordering food because they close at 10:30. We told the fellow, who said he was the boss, that we thought they were open until 11. He said "No we close at 10:30." He said both Yelp and Tripadviser were wrong! He rushed us through our ordering to the point where he got our order wrong! When they brought us the wrong food at 10:31, they said they couldn't fix it because the kitchen was closed! They would take the food and give us our money back for the wrong orders, but refused to fix them. (We had the receipt that clearly spelled out the food we ordered was not the food we received. Personally, I think they delivered food that was quickest for them to prepare rather than what we ordered.) No apology was offered. Most importantly, the food was *mediocre* at best. Any restaurant that serves the food they choose to serve rather than the food a customer orders, should be avoided. You won't be missing anything.

Having found The Grove the previous day for dinner, I was enticed back by the Breakfast menu. I was so impressed with the food and the service, that I ate breakfast at The Grove every day for the rest of my trip.The freshly-squeezed orange juice was so fresh and delicious, it was like biting into a fresh orange. Over the many days having breakfast there, I tried the cappuccino and the cafe mocha from the coffee bar. Both were delicious, real chocolate in the cafe mocha and the best tasting cappuccino that I found in San Francisco."Dave's Way" Eggs Benedict with Bacon and Avocado was spectacular, I highly recommend it. Another breakfast item that I tried was the Grove French Toast, with caramelized bananas. Very delicious in its own right. I love avocado, so there was no beating "Dave's Way" Eggs Benedict.Every day, breakfast was delivered to my table very quickly, sometimes before my cappuccino or cafe mocha had been prepared. Only the last day, did I end up waiting and I think it was because I was sitting on the sidewalk patio and it was a cooler morning. They probably thought I was crazy to be out there, but I am Canadian.I am returning to San Francisco this October and will be making a return visit to The Grove, for sure!

We went for dinner because this location was close to our hotel. I get that we're in SF, and restaurants can be pricey, but the three of us had several good meals for less, including one on Pier 39. We each ordered a sandwich. The person at the counter asked if my husband and I wanted soup as if it were one of the side options, and I guess it is, but he didn't mention it was an additional $2-3. Then he asked if we wanted the standard beer. We didn't realize that was going to set us back an additional $8 each beer. My daughter ordered a fruit drink: $5. Total bill $75 for sandwiches!On top of that, you have to order at the counter, take a number and find a seat! And, the food was decent for the most part (my husband complained that there was too much mustard on his pastrami), but nothing great. Would never go back.

You seat yourself and order at a counter, and we loved the atmosphere - friendly and comfortable. We ordered a variety of food including a fruit plate, grilled cheese, avocado toast, several soups, and a yummy cinnamon bread pudding. All were delicious. You can choose between larger entrees or combine smaller dishes for a tasty meal - the avocado toast and cup of soup proved a good choice. While the food is somewhat expensive, it is quality food and we had a relaxing, fun meal. I think this is a great options for families looking for a casual but high quality meal out.

Everything was so freaking delicious, and it settled my stomach nicely from the alcohol the night before :)The only thing I didn't like was the pushy people saving tables before they even place an order. (They tell you to order first at the counter and then you get a number to place on the table you wish to hold.) But I still won't let that take away from the decadence of the meal.

We arrived here for Sunday breakfast and it ended up being brunch by the time we made it through the long line. There is no table service here yet the prices would suggest that it was - you even have to collect your own drink order and take it to your own table. They do not permit guests to seat themselves until after they have ordered at the counter, which is very impractical when you are carrying hot cups of coffee. It is way over priced - we paid over $40 for a grilled cheese sandwich and a vegetarian omelette and a few drinks. It's not worth lining up for, even though the food was ok and came out pretty quickly. The staff were also quite condescending and aggressive when calling out and taking orders.

We were in SF this weekend for a little get-away. We wanted to eat big at breakfast, because we had a jam-packed schedule and may not get to lunch. After a few online searches, we found this place and thought we'd give it a try. There was a huge line out the door - but there was an employee standing out there handing out menus and offering reassurances. So we stayed. It was about 10 minutes before we were at the front of the line and ordered. Perfect timing as they have a great menu and many choices.Despite the large crowd we found a seat on the patio with ease. Food came quickly and portion was generous! We had the French toast with side of bacon and caramelized bananas and the "dave's way" Eggs Benny. Both were amazing in taste! We also enjoyed perfect OJ and java.So impressed, we came back the next day (Monday) and there was no line-up. Food and service were again excellent! Prices are higher than average ($42 USD) for the above, plus tip. But it really was delicious!

Short rib tacos and pastrami sandwich were tasty. Large portions. We like to eat outdoors on the sidewalk but inside is interesting as well.

They lost my order and the service was terrible but the food was nice. Seems overwhelmed with people.

Had breakfast here three mornings of staying in Hotel Zelos (5 minute walk). Friendly service and BIG portions meant my wife and I often shared some dishes. Favourites were the Granola, Breakfast Burrito and Eggs Benedict.

Great casual place to eat at. The outdoor dining let's you see the different elements (sounds, scenery, smell) of the City!

Order at bar and then sit and wait for your food to come to your table. Very good food here. Great coffees and lattes, and omelets are fantastic. Lots of seating and outside seats available on a nice day. Rustic decor, Bruce Springsteen music playing -very cool place. I would return.

This restaurant was across from our hotel and it was perfect. Atmosphere, great help, great service, and great food. We went there both mornings for breakfast. We never felt like we had to rush to let someone else have our table. So relaxing!

Not so good

We were somewhat surprised that this place was disappointing, with so many good reviews. Our onion soup was weird, the hummus was boring, and the overall bill was more than expected, because of the price of the wine and beer.

Great spot for a quick meal before going to SFJazz

Good food and reasonable prices in the heart of San Francisco, close to the Opera House, City Hall, Davies, SFJazz, etc. Very good Cuban sandwich with salad. Lots to choose from on the menu. Probably good for breakfast, too, but haven't tried it. Although it is very busy, you walk up and order instead of waiting for a table. Someone needs to write an app that will help the servers find you when you have sat down--they seem to walk around endlessly looking for the number placed on your table....

Got to be the place to eat at

While staying in a nearbyhotel we were directed here by reception staff as we were wanting somewhere for breakfast. On arrival the queue was outside the door waiting to get in....we thought shall we wait? But it moved really quick and the staff gave out menus to browse while waiting. Service is good, you order then get a table and wait. Came quick and was excellent and the cost was very reasonable. I went for the oatmeal which came with fresh raspberries, almonds, dried cranberries cream and maple syrup!!! What a breakfast well worth the wait and half the hotel price. Go on do it..you won't be disappointed.

Excellent Food, Busy Place

The food here was very good, nice variety on the menu. When we arrived the line was quite long (counter service) but moved quickly. I was fortunate enough to snag a table inside - they have lots of patio seating, but it was typical SF weather - cold and windy!

Fresh squeezed OJ is a must and awesome food. I had the breakfast burrito and it was amazing. Everyone in my party loved their food too. Great vibe inside. Excellent breakfast spot. Kids menu too. My son loved the French toast.

I had about 30 minutes before my meeting in the area. Looking for a place to grab a quick bite, I stumbled on The Grove. From the moment I walked in, I knew it would be a good experience. The staff quickly answered my questions and it seemed that I had barely sat down and they were delivering my food. The eggs and hash browns were phenomenal! I can't wait to go back!

Lovely place.

I went there to eat last breakfast in SF before I came back to my home. I ordered french toast and caffe latte and it was amazing. The servers are very kind and I enjoyed food and also atmosphere. I absolutely wanna go there.

Good, woodsy ambiance, delicious food, wonderful orange juice! Had to schlep our own coffee and orange juice to the table without any tray or box, took 2 trips because one of us had to save a table.

Delicious brunch.

Found this on Google maps. Didn't disappoint! Very good, quick food. Go up to the menu board and cashier to order, then they deliver to your table. We had the denver and the spinach tomato and fontina omelettes. Lots of fresh ingredients, the hash browns and the greens were both excellent sides. Toasted bread was chewy and yummy. Busy busy place. Some couch seating around low tables seemed to be a good place for business meetings. 

For a modest, relaxed ordinary and reasonably priced meal go no further.

We were staying in San Francisco, eating out quite a few nights so at least once wanted a reasonably priced, nonfussy meal and had read good reviews so...... We were not disappointed. The friendly non stuffy atmosphere and speedy service was a good introduction and the chicken pot pie was a real hit. Along with the excellent Anchor Steam beer. And the desserts typically generous - a superb carrot cake stood out.We might easily have returned another night but time ran out in the end.

Great breakfast and incredible service

The first thing I noticed on entering The Grove was the incredibly friendly staff, so friendly and welcoming. We popped in for breakfast while staying in San Fran on business.We grabbed a table upstairs and selected from the huge amount of choice. I went for the French toast, and added the grilled banana. The breakfast was lovely. Huge portion! The staff popped back a few times to check all was ok.I would highly recommend and love to return if ever back in SF.

You can tell it's a good place just by the amount of people getting in. And indeed we did not get disappointed. Very affordable, yet good food.

Great vibe, food was mediocre

Perhaps we were unlucky, but the food was mediocre - the French Onion Soup was over-flavoured and thick consistency, and the Quesadilla was a little bland. The ambience was great though. Worth a try and hope you are luckier with the food!

Very close to the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. Excellent restaurant. Fast friendly service and good food. Healthy choices available. Clean place. No waiter. You order at counter and they bring your food when it is ready...would recommend this restaurant.

Great brunch menu, quick service, very very friendly staff and delicious food! We tried different egg dishes including the ranchero, French roast, oats and spiced chai. Everything was delicious and the staff offered to add a small table as the 6 of us were rather tightly squeezed into our space. A must visit in SF!

This place is popular and busy. Order from the counter and they will give you a number for your table. If you want coffee, it's easier to carry in a to go cup then the big mugs.

Great food, weak coffee

A popular place, a queue was forming at 0700 and by 0730 all the tables were full.Food was great, French Toast up there with the best, very generous portion, nice and light and fluffy with nice great crispy bacon.The coffee was a little on the weak side, ordered a second with a double shot - still weak compared to European standards.
