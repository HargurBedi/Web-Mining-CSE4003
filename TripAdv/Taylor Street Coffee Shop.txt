We didn't experience a queue and walked straight into the coffee shop and were seated straight away. We arrived around 10am but have to say as we left, there was a queue of about 6 waiting. We had a cooked breakfast which was served fast and plenty of coffee. I had millionaires bacon which was delicious but similar to the uk thinly sliced belly pork. I also tried toasted sour dough bread which was excellent. 

A decent restaurant

My friend brought me here for breakfast. It is a small coffee shop that has limited seats. Was there at 9am. There was already a queue. Waited for 20 minutes to get a table.Staff were great and the breakfast is huge and tasty.Would recommend this coffee shop to friends.

Went there with my wife and kid. We had the kid in a stroller and were sat down at a table fitting four persons. The stroller sat next to the table in a the tightly packed sitting area. We could immediately sence that we were not the "optimal" customers. The servers wemt out of their way to show their diassatisfaction with the stroller being there (even though they didn't offer an alternative place to put it untill the end of our meal). All of this would maybe have been tolerable if the food would have been above averave, which it surely was not. The famous billionaires bacon was mushy and textureless (albeit taisty), the scrambled eggs bland, and the english muffins burned. Lo and behold, the check arrived before we asked for it, and my wifes plate was removed from the table while she was still cheving, unable to tell the waiter she wasnn't finished. All this for $50. I was pissed enough with no wait, I would have been fuming had I waiyed in line for this fiasko/shitshow. Steer away from this place if you possibly can. TL;DR: Bland food, horrible service.

My husband and I stayed in Union Square in San Fran end of September and found this little gem just round the corner from our hotel. Their speciality is millionaires bacon which is fantastic, sweet and spicy.The food is great and freshly prepared, the staff attentive. There is not much seating but everything flows quickly and (while you are not hurried from your seat) turn around is swift so its worth waiting if there is a queue. We had breakfast here 3 out of the 4 days we were in San Fran. Its more expensive than a chain for breakfast but so worth it. Average breakfast for 2 was $50 (with Tips and Tax)

Amazing!The degree to which this relatively small (and visible to patrons) workspace kitchen is able to crank out an assortment of gourmet breakfast options at breakneck speed is quite incredible. Alas, the beauty of efficiency!Furthermore, If you are as I am, an appreciator of presentation quality and attention to detail. This is your place.During my four day visit, I found my way there twice. Limited to about 30 seats, primetime breakfast times will invariably include a wait of 15 min or more. Fight the urges of impatience, you will be rewarded. Vegetarian omelet and Sailor hash both superb!

The omelette was really good. The millionaire bacon was delicious! My wife said the pan cakes were good! Small little restaurant, but worth the wait!!

It's located next to the Hilton, in quite literally, a hole in the wall. There are about 8-10 tables, with at least 5 of those being 2-Tops. Get there early to avoid the wait. If there is a wait, it goes relatively quick, ours (starting just outside the door was 20 mins or so).All that being said, mine was great. I had the Sailor Hash. It's a little spicy, but fantastic.

This place was fantastic! I got the eggs Benedict classic with a pancake and sausage on the side. The hollandaise was so smooth and gentle, the eggs perfectly poached, and the Canadian bacon thick and delicious with the English muffin. The Sweet Swedish pancake was interesting and the sausage wasn't bad nor the hash. A lot of food so be mindful of adding sides.

Millionaires Bacon - A Must!
Rating: 5
Date: October 4, 2017
A lovely little hole-in-the-wall diner, decorated in early industrial with their own famous Millionaires Bacon, thick-cut, syrupy sweet, cayenne-spicy, strips of organic pork. Breakfast for one (two eggs, hash browns, two strips of bacon and two pieces of rye) with coffee was almost $23.00 so only Millionaires can afford to eat here regularly, but this is something you want to try at least once. The eggs were scrambled perfectly and the hash browns were crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside. This was definitely NOT your average diner breakfast. Absolutely worth the price.

I honestly don't even remember how long I waited in line to try this place out. But I remember telling my friend that this place was so tiny and small. It was a little hard as the table and chairs were also so tiny. The place was so pack and hopping. The line was long but i think it was worth the wait.Beside the small area, we got out food really quick and the food was amazing. The fruit was fresh, hand place on your plate, the display was amazing. I don't think I would have the patient to place the pieces in such design. One other places you should try if you're there. I would have like go to back there for lunch but didn't have the time.

I highly recommend the place for a great start!they open pretty early and generally have queue to be seated but not more than 15 mins. Trust me it's worth the wait. First day I tried their billionaire bacon with sunny side up eggs,sour dough toast and hash brown.It was excellent. Bacon is thick juicy and crisp with some cayenne and sweet BBQ sauce I think. Really good flavor. Second day has their regular bacon, also crisp and good taste. I recommend trying their strawberry and marmalade jams as well.the coffee is great too. All in all good vibes, pleasant staff and positive experience.

We got here on a Saturday just after 7am and managed to get seated straight away. Soon after that (i.e. By 7.15am), the queue began (it is a fairly small place and cannot seat lots of people).The staff were friendly and attentive, but the food (whilst decent) was not anything special. We both had eggs over easy on sourdough with hash brown. I had mine with millionaires bacon. The bacon was nice enough and the eggs were done well, but the hash brown was bland and uninspired (it needed seasoning). Whilst the name says coffee shop, there is only filter coffee available (which is regularly topped up whilst seated).It may well be that this is the only decent breakfast place in this area (hence some of the higher reviews) and if so, it is probably worth a visit to fuel up for the day but I doubt that I would queue up for very long (if at all).

We went for breakfast and anticipated that we would have to wait for a table- it wasn't too bad actually maybe 10-15mins, food was very tasty we both had variations of eggs benedict- one of the servers was racing around and not very friendly she dropped down our check when we still both had eaten not even half our plates? That made us feel rushed, a few minutes later another check was dropped down as she'd forgotten about the first, I think she wanted to keep the tables moving for obvious reasons but it was a bit much

Hope they get the chance to extend at a certain moment, would certainly be worth the investment if you ask me.

While the food was an bit pricey....the portions more than made up for it. We were lucky enough to catch this gem for one breakfast as they closed for the next 2 days during our stay in SF. Word of advice, they open at 7am and by 7:30am, there is already an 15-20 minute line up ...so go early. Worth the wait, if you are not in an hurry

This tiny gem put out big taste! The staff is friendly and accommodating. This restaurant was directly across the street from my hotel(Hilton). I read the reviews prior to going and the prior guests were spot on. The food was delicious and all of the ingredients seemed unusually fresh. I ordered a California omelet. Best omelet ever! Breakfast for two was $40, without coffee. I bit expensive but well worth the price! The restaurant seats approximately 20 people, get there early, like I did. They open at 7 am. I will definitely return in the future.

We came here twice, and despite being Breakfast, the best meal of the holiday. The queue eases about 11.30, but you don't have to wait that long. The millionaire bacon is lovely, I included mine in Taylor's Hash, which reminds me of corn beef hash : potato, onion, red and green peppers, bacon , cheddar cheese.We also had pancake, piggy burger - it was all delicious. There are 10 tables 6 tables for two and 4 for four. As you queue you can watch them cook each order. Very quick , efficient , tasty - and you can see why they have such a good reputation. You can see from the photos the size and layout, and from the invoice the prices.

Obviously, Sunday brunch in SF during peak summer time is going to be a busy time for restaurants. So mentally prepare yourself to wait if you're staying near Union Square and want to enjoy Million Dollar Bacon and Swedish Pancakes. The restaurant only seats about 35 people so space is limited. The cooks and staff do a great job with the space they have. My wife and I enjoyed the breakfast and short conversation with the waitress. Our brunch came out quickly after we ordered. The only wait was the 50 min to an hour waiting in line. We arrived at 8:45 am which I thought was early enough. The food was greasy spoon style with your standard hash browns, eggs, etc. They add a little flair by having million dollar bacon and Swedish pancakes on the menu. I enjoyed the bacon more so than the pancake, which to me tasted like a regular pancake rather than a really really thin pancake. Both were worth a try tho! Lol! You'll here it a lot while standing in line at this joint, it's worth the wait.

When we went to restaurant there was a line of about 6-8 people outside. We thought no problem. An hour to an hour and a half later we got to the front of the line and had to take our food to go. The food was indeed great. Fruit was perfect. California omelette and wheat toast excellent. I would say that this is a place very worth going to if there is no line or if you have unlimited time to stand in a tight area waiting. The comments on this site saying the line moves quickly were highly inaccurate on the day we were there.

I had the eggs benedict/florentine with fresh fruit instead of the usual side. The food was almost perfect. The fruit had the perfect combination of blueberries, strawberries, melon, apple, grapes....each at the peak of freshness and ripeness. The spinach could have used maybe 15 seconds more saute time or half a pinch of sugar to take away a hint of bitterness. The best breakfast I've had in years. A little pricey for breakfast but worth it.This place is tiny: 4 cooks, a kitchen, 1 waitress, 24 eating patrons and 15 in line all crammed into about 40 square meters. Essentially, a small diner...perhaps the best in the world! I would be 20 pounds heavier if this place was close to where I live.

This little place can get a line out the door fast. There are only 6-8 tables that can each sit 2 people. Staff can push tables together for bigger groups than 2,... if you are willing to wait for more people to finish. I wouldn't recommend a group larger than 4. You may wait a LONG time.The seating area is loud (wood floors, small spaces, open cooking area, and chatter). It was also very hot in there. Not sure if they don't have AC or if it was broken. I was in thin Tshirt and shorts and was sweating. And it was 8:30am so it was only about 60 degrees outside!Servers were friendly and food is good. I have had better for the price, but it wasn't bad.

My husband had read the reviews that mentioned hour long waits, and he didn't want to wait that long. We went just before 9 on a Wednesday, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I loved the millionaire's bacon; our book club makes the Ina Garten version that has pecans and maple syrup. This one has no nuts and plenty of spice. The bacon is extra thick, which works well with the topping. Service was fast and efficient, they kept the coffee coming and brought more hot water for tea. The plates were nicely garnished with good fresh fruit, and the raspberry jam at the table was thick and tasted homemade. Great breakfast"

I'm under the impression that's normal for this place. They only have about 8 tables that can seat about 28 people at a time. Also, two omelettes with coffee, tea and ONE side of bacon was around $60 with tip. (Everything is San Francisco costs a fortune. Prepare yourself if you haven't been here before.). I would usually be furious to wait so long and pay so much...but I left here totally happy. Do yourself a favor and eat breakfast here. It's freakin good.

Fabulous breakfast, you must try the bacon!

Came for breakfast as close to where we were staying and the reviews were good. It is very small and out timing was great, only one group waiting ahead of us. By the time we left the queue was down the street. Great menu selection, hard to choose. Ended up both having the hash but one of each option. Came with a 'side' of 2 eggs and toast - couldn't eat it, the hash was so filling. Also had to try their Millionaires bacon - wow, so good, worth it for sure. Endless coffee and the orange juice was lovely. Service efficient and pleasant, not a long wait for food.

Fantastic breakfast and worth the wait in the line-up

Make sure you are hungry because the breakfast is big but delicious. We had the Chef's special hash browns with Bacon, onions, peppers and either Hollandaise or cheese along with two eggs over easy. Cooked to perfection. 

Breakfast was fabulous!!!

My family and I were visiting SF and I found this place thru Trip Advisor. It was close to The Hilton so we decided to give it a try. We got there at 7:30am and we had to wait in line (that's indicator #1 of a great place). While we waited for our seat, we watched them make breakfast. The strawberries they used were huge and looked so good! The servers were friendly, quick and efficient. I had cornflake french toast, my one daughter had regular french toast and my husband had eggs with hash browns with bacon, green peppers, mushrooms, cheese - OMG it was delicious! I would go back there again but - go there as soon as they open or be prepared to wait in line. It is super small - maybe 8 tables and not all tables can fit 4 people. Big groups of people would be hard to seat. 

Very good breakfast

Was up very early due jet lag. Found this on trip advisor. Think they open at 7 and we were there a few minutes past and it was full. Could not reserve table so went for walk around block and when we got back there was a short wait for table. Worth the wait. Very good home cooked breakfast. Absolutely recommend.

Best breakfast in San Francisco!

Wonderful spot. Always crowded but worth the wait! Seating is limited. Food came out quickly and was incredible. We loved it!

We visited here after reading all the reviews on Tripadvisor and I'm glad that we did. The cafe is tucked away and you'd be forgiven for walking straight past it. When we arrived, there was a queue and when we left 45 mins later, there was still a queue. This shows just how popular this place is. They do turn around tables really quickly, and because of this the staff here are on the ball, bringing out drinks and food efficiently. They have all usual dishes you'd expect from a breakfast place, but we both had pancakes. Pancakes were beautifully presented with fruit on the side and they definitely tasted as good as they looked. If I'm ever in the area again, it's definitely a place that I'll be visiting.

Beautiful brunch

The restaurant is pretty small, but we were able to get seated in less than 15 minutes on a Sunday morning (miracle!). Ordered the millionaire bacon (amazing!), Taylor hash (really good!), and fruit (fresh!). Needless to say, we loved it. It wasn't cheap though; with food and juice for two it ended up being $50, but it was worth it!

Cosy and delicious breakfast place

Visited around 09am on a Friday morning and waited for around 20min so not that long. The wait was worthwhile as the breakfast was delicious. Had the vegetarian omelet and fresh fruit with coffee and it was a great start of my day.

We waited for about 10 minutes for a table early morning, armed with severe jet lag... and it was 200% worth it. Fresh is an understatement.... delicious is an understatement... no fancy coffees but the regular coffee with milk is more than ok. Very quick service, highly recommended. Portions are big so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your tummy!!

Really hit the spot!

We visited yesterday morning (12 June) and had to wait a short while to be seated (surely a good sign). Kitchen is on full display too which is also a good sign. Once seated we were efficiently served our cooked breakfasts which were both very delicious and nicely prepared and presented. Quantities were ample contrary to some other reviews - and we both had good hearty appetites amplified by walking the Golden Gate the day before. Definitely give this place a try if you're staying within range of it. Very attentive and pleasant staff and prices that are about right for the area

We arrived before opening at 7.00 and had a fantastic breakfast, delicious and more than I could manage. A queue had formed and was out the door by the time we had left. 

Pretty Good

This cafe was right across from our hotel in San Francisco. It seem very popular, there was always a line to seat down but they only have 10 tables. We visited for breakfast twice it was just delicious. The strawberries were the best I have had in some time. I loved it. I highly recommend it.

Worth the wait to get in!!

We go here every time we spend the night in SF. A short walk from the Hilton or the Nikko on O'Farrell

This cute spot was near our hotel and was our first stop in the city. We arrived during lunch hours on a Friday afternoon so we didn't have a wait at all. Like others have said, it's a narrow little place with few tables so they can't help but have a wait during prime hours. Total hole in the wall with cute trendy lighting and just a good vibe. I'd have been happy even if we had to wait a bit. I had the corn flake french toast and we shared the millionaire's bacon. My husband had an omelette, I believe. All was good, not amazing. My portion wasn't OTT like most places. While I get annoyed at those gigantic portions because who could finish all that..... I could have actually eaten a little more than what I got here, if I'm being honest (oink). So even though the food didn't blow my mind... and it was expensive.... and my husband had a view into the open storage closet in the back.... I still love this place and would go again and again. You should try it.

Great small and most likely family owned business. Be prepared to wait for a table since it is a popular place. I had one of the omelets and a glass of fresh orange juice and both were good. I gave 4 stars due to the price I paid which was close to $23 before tips.

We decided to try this breakfast place due to the great reviews. This is a very small place, maybe 9 -10 tables, all tables for two, except 2 tables for four and all in a very narrow, rectangular space. We were there by 9am and waited 45 minutes to be seated at a table. When you make it in the doorway, you are standing against the wall and have a front row view of fast and furious and continuous cooks at the breakfast grill. It will make you re-think what you thought you were going to order, while waiting in line. Finally, seated the service is fast and yet, they don't rush you. I guess they feel that you waited long enough and you now deserve to be there and enjoy your meal. There are lots of delicious choices for breakfast, the food is delicious and it truly is worth the wait. Don't plan on eating a cheap breakfast here, our bill was $60 for two people. Is it worth a try, sure, because it is delicious, quaint and unique. You need to try it at least once!

Amazing breakfast.

Within easy reach of Union Square, this is a good breakfast option. It's tiny so be prepared to queue to get a seat.
