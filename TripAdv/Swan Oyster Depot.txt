Poor respect to it's customers. Be prepared for waiting standing up on the street at least for an hour, they close at 4:45 (not 5:30pm), so if you were in line they will just let you know they are closing and don't serve you anymore. Yes it is delicious and fresh, but the portions are very small and too expensive. Definitely not worth going back.

We stopped here on a recommendation and were told to go at an off hour. There was still a line out the door! The staff asked if we wanted a beer while we waited which was super nice. Once you sit the menu is on a giant board and can be a bit confusing but the staff is helpful with that. We got oysters, clam chowder, sashimi, and the combo salad. Everything was fresh and came out very fast. We were in and out of there in less than 40 minutes and it was a great experience. If you are in town I would highly recommend stopping here for food!

Service is first of all SUPER at the Swan Oyster Depot. The people working in the restaurant is welcoming and so pleasant to talk to.In my oppinion the salads could use some extra fixings. But all the fish and shell fish is of top quality.All in all a great visit - the line can be a bit long but worth the wait

This is a fantastic oyster bar frequented by locals where the service is fantastic and the food even better.We had a long wait in the queue to get in as the bar only takes about 20 people. But it was well worth it.The family-run place had lots of character and amazing seafood. It was really nice to watch the locals coming in to eat in or takeaway their seafood and they were treated like part of the family.We had the oysters which were some of the best we have had, and also the Sicilian style sashimi. Just perfect!!!

There will be a line waiting even before the place opens, that's how good the seafood is here. Everything is fresh and you will taste seafood the way it suppose to be eaten. The place is just one long counter.....no tables. Order what you want, it will be delivered within minutes. Is it expensive? Slightly, but that's how good seafood is. When you're finished, just summon anyone behind the counter and tell them you want the bill. He'll scratch out/total your eats on a napkin and then you pay. Nothing fancy, it's a joint ! They do NOT have a website...everything is by word of mouth.

This place is quite popular we waited about 40 minutes on a weekday at lunch time, apparently it gets much longer on the weekend. The restaurant is bar seating and is quite small. We ordered the clam chowder, a dozen oysters and half a dozen clams for $60 including tax and tips. I have not had much clam chowder before but it is definitely much better than anything at Fisherman's wharf, you can actually taste the sweetness of the clams. Even though we only got a cup, they gave us plenty of bread. We got 3 different varieties of oysters and they were all really fresh and delicious. As for clams, we got 3 each of little necks and cherrystone. These were served with an array of sides, including fresh horseradish which was really good. The staff were all friendly and the restaurant has a family owned feel. Beware that this place is cash only. The prices are fair considering the quality of the ingredients.If you're a seafood lover, this is worth the wait. Be sure that you're not in a rush to be anywhere.

Arrived at place at 10.40am on a Friday morning and there was a long line. I skipped the queue and requested for takeout instead, which still took at least 15-20min. The wait was worthwhile though, as my Sicilian Sashimi set and half a dozen oysters were absolutely fresh and delicious. Great seafood. I will try to brace myself for the crowd again for a future visit.

I wanted to try the local clam chowder and was searching websites for recommendations. One website recommended this restaurant which ranks highly on Anthony Bourdain's list whenever he is in town (not sure!)I arrived late in the PM and the queue was very very long! Be prepared to wait 1-2 hours on a weekday! Being a single diner - I was able to get seated slightly faster!I ordered the Clam Chowder, Crab cocktail and a Crab back. The menu was fairly limited but the seafood was fairly fresh.However, to be honest, I was not that impressed with the Clam Chowder. The Crab back was interesting (you either love it or not!). The Crab cocktail was not bad.The whole meal set me back $40 (inc tips). Will i return? Probably not the next time I am in San Francisco as it was quite a walk from Union Square. I will recommend a cab from your hotel.

Needed to wait more than 90 minutes standing in a queue at the street. Limited seats available to eat quickly just at the bar, not any other place or table to sit inside the restaurant. They preserved the original shape and style. Quite authentic. Seafood was fresh. Soup was tasty. Pricey as natural for a so famous place in San Francisco. Good experience but I would not spend so much time to repeat it.

To be fair, I am ONLY giving this a 3 because I ONLY tried the the clam chowder. As a New Englander (born and raised), I am a "Chowdah-head" and a clam chowder snob. This IS NOT great chowder. At best, it is OK. It is thin, and there are very few clams. I did not try the oysters, so this is a limited review. But most people RAVE about the chowder, so I had to try and make a review. I WOULD NOT go out of my way for this clam chowder.

Before we came to town, we were told by friend "this might be the best restaurant on earth". I was a bit skeptical at the beginning almost wanted to give up when seeing the long line. We waited about 2 hrs before getting seated. Ordered crab salad, smoked salmon, clam chowder & oysters, everything was so amazing, I ended up having 2 cups of clam chowder myself. The whole meal was bit expensive though, we spent 114$ two of us on lunch.

If you are a seafood lover, or a lover of tradition in seafood - you will love this place. I never ever ever have a bad experience here - even when I have to wait close to an hour to get it - it is always worth the wait! Their clam chowder is one of a kind, the fish is always fresh, the oysters are to die for and last but not least - the most cool and tip top service from some amazing guys and gals that have worked here for generations. If we are in the bay - we will on purpose come here - it's the best!

We visited here because we saw this restaurant featured on an Anthony Bourdain show and thought it would therefore be a good place to try some great seafood in the city. There are only about 12 seats at the bar (no tables) so there was a wait outside, but on a Thursday at about 1:30pm we waited about 20-30 mins. Be sure you hit a bank machine first as it's cash only and it's not inexpensive. We ordered an Anchor steam beer, shrimp cocktail, smoked fish and it came with Sourdough bread. They were kind enough to provide me with a plate of half smoke white fish and half smoked trout so I could try a bit of both. After tip it was about $50 for 2 people for a light lunch. The only thing I was disappointed by was it seemed not everything was local and I couldn't tell where each seafood item was sourced.

Wait too long for what happens when you get a seat. IMO expensive as hell. Servers are great. Make you feel welcome. The wait is onerous. The food is good and fresh- They are kind of loose with preparation cleanliness. I think this is a place that looks good to tourists because there is a line out front. The " thing to do while is Frisco". There must be 30 places within a mile that can provide the same quality food without a wait-

If your looking for seafood and a mix of oysters and raw fish or seafood salad your have found your place. We were there at 11:30 and it was packed so be prepared to wait. While you wait you can watch dishes be made and it can help you find something. We had a sashimi plate and oysters. All delicious but the UNI was ordered a lot. So if that's your thing it's alive and they prepare it for you. Go and enjoy.

It had been about 5 years since my last visit to San Fran and the Swan Oyster Depot; I wasn't sure if I had built the memory up in my mind...not at all - still great! Last time I arrived at 11.30am and was in a queue of 4 people - this time I arrived a couple minutes before 11am and was in a queue of 15, with people already seated inside. Someone mentioned they opened at 10.30 - not sure. Bust place no doubt and with only about 15 seats at a long bar, you simply have to wait until someone moves along. The guy behind me walked in and got a beer in a plastic cup, so he could consume it as he waited. The older guy that served me on this occasion wasn't very friendly. They serve bread if you like, but that just takes up room that fresh seafood would otherwise occupy! I ordered the Crab and Prawn salad which was delicious - so fresh and filling, which I had forgotten about as I also ordered a small plate of seafood carpaccio. Both fresh and tasty, though next time I'd ask they do not add oil to the carpaccio as it was a little oily and took away from the freshness. Definitely worth a visit but be prepared to wait.

All I wanted to eat in SF was fresh crab. One restaurant told us there wasn't any because of red algae! Obviously no-one told Swan Oyster Depot because we feasted on their 'crabsanthemum', a plate of fat juicy crab legs, unadorned but accompanied by everything you could want from lemon wedges and horseradish to cocktail sauce and vinegar. We loved it so much we lined up the next morning too and were delighted when they opened the door early. I loved this place. It's simple, clever and knows exactly what it is doing. They have a brilliant product and stick to it. The guys behind the counter were friendly and helpful. We loved the glass of Californian Tattinger.Finding this place just round the corner was an unexpected bonus of staying in a modest Holiday Inn. If you love beautiful seafood in all its natural glory this is the place for you.

I usually have a rule that no food is worth waiting in line for. However my wife was insistent this restaurant was worth it so I sucked it up. After about an hour in line we finally made it and I can absolutely say it was worth it. The crab back is a must have while here along with the oysters. We tried the Uni and it was interesting but not something I'll go wild for.

This place is a must if your'e in San Francisco. Get there early because there is pretty much a line that forms and stays there all day. They don't take reservations, it is first come, first serve. Plan ahead. It's a fish and seafood market, first and foremost so most locals pick up and carry out to prepare the food at home.If you're a foodie you will want to check out Anthony Bourdain's visits there. He's been there twice on a few of his episodes. You want to get the smoked salmon and crab back for sure. Some of the best items are not on the menu so talk to the killer staff that works there. They've all been there for years and are family.While you're waiting in line, ask for a drink, Anchor Steam on tap, and watch the passerby's in the neighborhood...good people watching. The place only seats about 20 - 25 at a time.It is a do not miss for sure!

First note. Get there a half an hour before it opens otherwise you will wait. Waiting is fine, but then some of the fresh ingredients aren't available. We had some extremely fresh oysters, salmon, scallops crab. No rush once you get in all of the staff is extremely patient and very attentive. All of the sea food was very fresh. If you get there early you can park on the street for a few bucks and get in and out with no problem. Skip the Chowder not the best in the city. The crab back is limited and very true to form. If you don't like the row then do not get this item. Really my best advice is to go. Unless you want something Fufu. Enjoy yourself and enjoy some of the local talent along with seafood. Cheers

One of the rare locations in San Francisco that both locals and tourists will visit even if they must share the small space and suffer the indignity of waiting in a line. However, everyone is pretty friendly and happy in anticipation of some exceptional and FRESH seafood. Even Bourdain felt the love...Big Tip: who says you cant do this for breakfast?! I often happen by early in the morning and get a combo shrimp and crab salad to go. I mean early like 9 am. No line and I can talk about San Francisco boxing lore with the boys before the rush.

First trip to San Francisco, I happen to pass by and noticed a crowd. Sure why not, I said to myself - I am a seafood lover after all. I waited, the environment reminded me a lot of Russ and daughters in NYC. Ordered a few of its dishes, oysters were good, clams bland, the combination cocktail was just not my thing, I noticed someone ordered a dish that was not listed called Sicilian and it seemed like tuna sashimi. If you love the bitter taste of Capers than give it a try. Everything tasted somewhat fresh, next trip to SanFrancisco I might skip it. But I can see how its a local spot, it has history and there's not many places like this in SF. At least I didn't see many.

After eating here a few times over the years I regretfully have to stop. Here's why. I love the people that work there and I love the food. But I don't like that everything is prepared with bare hands, and that sometimes you see the guys put food in their mouths and on top of that they are cleaning things and handling money as this place is cash only. If they ever decide to use food prep gloves and change some of their ways I might be back but until then my love affair with Swan Oyster is over.

I fancied some oysters, so searching on TA for a recommendation - i found Swan. What a gem! I was very lucky to walk in and sit down straight away - apparently, there is usually a queue. We walked in at 4.30pm - be aware they take last orders at 5pm, and close at 5.30pm... ish... ;o) Also note they dont take cards - CASH only! And make sure you bring quite a bit of cash, as they have so many amazing dishes to try - its easy to rack up a $100+ bill...So, I have a mixed-seafood cocktail, which was great. Very fresh and tasty, with huge lumps of Crab meat, as well as various size prawns and other seafood. Delicious sauce! Next, 1/2 dozen mixed oysters. Who knew oysters could taste so different - an education in oyster variety for me! Super fresh and no side effects days after!!! They also offer every sauce and condiment possible to accompany the oysters. Next - Their amazing Sashimi plate - various catch-of-the-day white fish, plus salmon and Scallops dressed with olive oil and capers - best dish so far!!! As I BIG sushi/sashimi fan - I would rather eat this over a Japanese version any day!!!As you can see from photos - the place is small and you all sit along a bar - which means you have the opportunity to meet new people. I ended up having a great chat with my neighbours, and the restaurant staff - ending is lots of laughter! Be open, and enjoy the place - its sooo social as well as an amazing eatery!I liked it so much - im going there again tomorrow, armed with a bucket of $$$ and a titan sized appetite! Hope you enjoy the place too sometime!Cheers!

I can't get enough of this place, but rather than giving a traditional review, I'll focus on the nitty-gritty details for people:1) cash only, there's an ATM across the street if you forget2) remember to either come alone or at most with ONE other person, as you can't reasonably try to bring more, if only because it takes forever for three seats in a row to become available. If you come by yourself poke your head to the front and look for the single seats that keep popping up, then you can skip the line and take them, bypassing all the groups of two people waiting for two seats together to open up3) show up 15 minutes before they open, plan on a good half hour in line4) Lots of great off menu items, like the Crab-Santhemum, etc5) if you're in a rush and don't have the time to go they do sell food to go from the display, just be vocal about it

This place is incredible! Steve and his team are great. Ask them about how many beers Wade Boggs can drink. Trust me!There are no pictures because I ate it all too quickly! There will be a wait. Don't complain. That's just how it is. This place rocks! You can skip the line by ordering to go (but you won't get to hang out with these incredible guys so don't do that). Even if you can get there prior to opening, someone will have beaten you there. Don't worry. Grab a coffee (or fill your favorite mug with beer or bring your growler and share) and enjoy the wait. Now on to the food!My favorite dish is the crabsanthymum; a huge plate of crab claws served with cocktail. Pro tip: ask for the "oil and vinegar"! It's crab fat mixed with some Dijon mustard, vinegar, and black pepper. It's life changing! Steve made us some today and I miss it already. My mouth is literally watering right now!Then get the scallop sashimi with olive oil, capers, and red onion. Incredible! The fresh, sweet scallop is he best scallop I've ever had (sorry, Thomas Keller). Then get the uni! It's so fresh the spines of the recently dispatched echinoderm (it is served in the body) are still moving as you eat it! Spectacular! The array of oysters and clams available is staggering. They are great! That Thai chile hot sauce will make you wanna slap your mama, but don't use too much or you will lose the oyster!The smoked fish are to die for (they will make a sampler if you ask... no need to pick one. I loved the Nova Scotia style salmon though the hot smoked salmon was great. The white fish was excellent and I thought the trout was fabulous!The crab salad is incredible as well. It's a generous eloping of crab served with an incredible mayo based dressing... wonderful! The chowder was not my favorite, but to each his own (i'm there for the seafood in its truest form). The Sicilian sashimi is also incredible! I could go on, but this is one of my favorite places ALL TIME because the employees are fantastic and the seafood is fresher than any you can find anywhere!

Arrived at 10.30 am on a Saturday morning to a line 20 deep. Got in line and was seated within 40 minutes. One long counter with people sitting elbow to elbow, being served by what may look to be an intimidating brigade of guys, but who are actually very warm and gracious. Started with the clam chowder - average. Moved on to the stars of the show - fresh seafood by the pile. Had the Sicilian sashimi, simply dressed with olive oil and capers and onions. So bright and delicious. A dozen mixed oysters on the half shell - they have a series of sauces (the thai chilli one is obscenely spicy), but I'm a purist sticking with the lemon and horse radish. Fantastic. Finally, I had the lump crab meat and shrimp salad. Mounds of shrimp and crab over lettuce, topped with what is described as a Louise Sauce, which is kinda like a thousand island type dressing. Delicious - the crab was sweet and flavourful and the shrimp were fresh and perfectly textured - no mushy, defrosted seafood here. The salad is huge and after what i had already ordered, I couldn't finish it. Highly recommend this. Great restaurant, no nonsense menu, fresh, delicious seafood. You will not be disappointed.

On a sunny monday in April we got in line at Swan's at 11:40 AM, we were seated and sipping on a beer at 12:30. 40 minutes, not too bad I hear. The chowder was well above average, the shrimp and crab salad was the best I have ever had, the oysters were in my top 10. The people you meet in line are from all over the map, locals, foodies, and a few Anthony B fans like me. The service is down to earth, you enjoy your meal without feeling pressured to finish up so the next person can sit at the lunch counter stool. It is not "fine" dining, just "mighty fine food"!

I'm sad that Anthony Bourdain did me wrong.I was watching CNN: Parts Unknown (SF edition) and Swan Oyster was one of the spots that Tony stopped by. He kept saying amazing things about it and said it was a must if you're in San Fran - you know, the typical spiel. But he usually easily convinces me and whenever I watch his show about destinations I'll be going to, I always make a note to check out those places.So my friend and I (more so me), decided to get some oysters here during our weekend trip to the City by the Bay. We first went on a Sunday afternoon, not knowing that it was closed on Sundays. But that's on me. I knew they closed at 5 pm in general, I just didn't know they weren't open everyday. Maybe that was a warning sign of what a bad experience it would be. But alas, this premonition was no match for our persistence, for we trekked all the way back there again on Monday.The place is just one long bar, that fits probably 20 people. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. Once we were, it did take a bit of time for them to clean up our area. We ordered the crab back and a dozen oysters. The crab back (which was GREAT) came out quickly, but our oysters were nowhere to be found. It must have gotten lost with our server because he too was nowhere to be found. After we got our crab back, he never came back to check on us. It seems he was too busy on the other end, shucking oysters for everybody but us. When we were finally able to flag down a different server, we just asked for the check because we were already in a rush, after waiting 20 minutes for our non-existent oysters.I guess that saying rings true - "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

It took me an hour in the lineup to get a seat. Biggest caveat is bring cash. They do not take any form of plastic. Very friendly service. Menu is on the wall and pretty basic. They seem to be willing to put together anything you ask for at a price. Everything was very fresh... considering it was expensive, there was a fair size portion. The seafood chowder was tasty, creamy, but I found it was full of potato and no actual seafood. A fair size wide list, a few beers on tap.

This experience was one of the most unique I've had in San Francisco. I can only say it was worth the wait. We got there when it opened at 10:30 on a Thursday. We waited outside in line for 45 minutes. There are only about a dozen counter seats. The oysters were amazing but the crab leg salad was off the hook!!!! The smoked fish plate was out of this world, too....and the bloody Mary's were to die for. Coming back sooner than later. The only negative besides the long wait outside were the panhandlers that approach you for money. One of them wasn't nice at all when I didn't give him anything.

Apart from the quaint atmosphere, this place is an establishment and boasts really great seafood.Place is small and be prepared to queue.Though the combination salad is a popular choice, I think the tastier bits are the crab claws. So go for crab salad instead.

Fresh seafood, extremely delicious, like omakase!

I had the crab cocktail, a dozen of oysters platter, the Crab Fat, smoked salmon and smoked trout, mixed sashimi platter (scallops, tuna, salmon, hamachi and sardine). I really enjoyed the crab cocktail and Crab Fat. Fresh seafood but be there early and be prepared to wait as there are limited seats only. Shop opens at 1030am, queued from 1000am but got my seat at 1215pm (lots of waiting customers who arrived way before 1000am!). Trust me, worth the wait!

Nothing fresh here

A fresh seafood restaurant is where you choose a live crab or fish from a tank and have it prepared as you wish. Nothing here is like that. The crab is pre cooked and frozen and served cold and thawed, which is why it is watery and tasteless. The shrimp cocktail has small, pink and mushy shrimp served with a cocktail sauce like ketchup. Only the oysters on a shell are served live, but this is expected from any oyster bar. Ask for steamed crab with butter and you won't get it, because they can't prepare it. Ask for mayonnaise, which should be made fresh daily with raw eggs, and they'll reach for a Kraft Best Foods jug behind the counter. Scratch your head when all this adds up to $60. There is no cooking or preparation except for shucking oysters and mixing sauces and except perhaps the clam chowder. There is no culinary skill in any of the dishes, making for a bland menu with little choice. There is nothing really wrong with this place as long as you set your expectations correctly. Unfortunately, it has been hyped up because of celebrity food journalists, made worse by the long wait which creates a perceived value in the experience not related to the quality of the food. I'd eat here happily for a third of the cost and no wait. But this does not look likely in the near future.

Went here recently and the food was great and atmosphere was unique.Easy to get to on the California cable car line if you are coming from Union Square or similar. California cable car line is fun because it still has more of a public transit feel than the more popular Powell Street lines. (Be sure to get a Muni Passport (you can buy and display one on your smartphone) to avoid the $7 each way fare on the cable cars)First things: you will most likely wait a very long time to get in. We arrived at opening time of 10:30 am on MLK day and we were seated at about 12:30 pm. The primary reason is that they have only about 20 seats and are very popular.Dress appropriately for the weather and have the attitude that waiting in line is an opportunity to get to know people from around the country and you will be fine (shout out to our new friends from Atlanta and Chicago). Several groups arrived and then gave up once they found out about the line and its slow movement.Once the line ends you are seated on some rickety stools at a jumbled counter. Hand written signs are everywhere and the menu is just a big sign on the wall. Prices are in the $20-$30 range for their signature salads.We ordered the crab salad ($29) and the prawn salad ($22). Both were very simple presentations with generous portions of crab or prawns on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce. Comes with a portion of delicious Louis dressing on the side. Nothing fancy, but the BEST Dungeness crab and prawns I have had since I processed crab back in the day in Alaska. Very fresh and tasty. Service was great by this family run business.We also ordered a crab back to share. Crab back is an emptied Dungeness crab shell filled with a concoction of butter and unknown crab stuff. It is served cold and you dip delicious sourdough bread into it. Fishy tasting and a little strange, but fun to try out if you have a sense of adventure.We have a new 'must do' spot whenever we visit San Francisco!

An experience not to be missed. The Sicilian Sushi is completely amazing, as is the ambiance of this micro diner-style restaurant. Excellent service and no hurry once you are seated, although seating can require a lengthy wait. Sometimes the line can be very long, if so, consider take-out. The food and experience not to be missed.

We live close by and have been wanting to eat here for months. Finally, for my birthday we went for lunch after not having been for over 20 years. Take it from native San Franciscans; this place is the real thing for sea food! In addition to the menu offerings, there are several "off the menu" dishes that were mentioned in an article in the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper last year.

Was referred by a friend. Finally get to the place and there's a lineup outside in the pouring rain. I then Knew it would be worth it. It's a simple furnished bar style restaurant that seems to rely on its food rather then it's decor. And really, once you take your first bite you don't care about anything else other than the taste. Sooooooooo awesome! I watched as the staff prepared sushi plates, de-boned a salmon and prepared take out orders. It was like watching a show. Very personable staff who checked on their customers. If you have a chance to go DO. If not make the time! Well worth it.

This is a very touristy spot, so be sure to expect a 30 min wait as they only seat ~15-20 people at a time, and there's always a line out of the door. I ordered a tray of clams, a crab back (open crab shell filled with crab trimmings to dip bread in) a clam chowder, a crab cocktail, and a cracked crab. Everything was good, everything was delicious. They also serve beer here. Staff was super friendly as well, which was surprising considering how touristy it is. I'm glad it lived up to the hype. It's pricy though, so be prepared to spend some money.

We got there on a Monday at 2:45 and got in line (maybe 10 people in front of us). I heard someone walking by that the line was the shortest he had ever seen so I'm going back on a weekday in the middle of the afternoon again the next time, too. It's tight once you get seated and you're up close and personal with your seat mates not to mention the staff. It's all worth it though. Crab salad was amazing and the oysters were perfect. Service was friendly and congenial. Asked about closing at 5:30 and they said if you weren't in line by 4:45 you wouldn't be served as the bar stools get turned upside down when a diner leaves after 4:45. All in all a great gem in the middle of he city. As old school as you get and it's perfect.

We had not been to San Francisco for about ten years so you must have your priorities straight. Yes, this was our first stop- even before checking in at the hotel. It was just as we remembered it. It is a local place not really updated in a tastefully long time. We started with a dozen oysters- they never have been able to count well- there were at least 12 if you get my point. We followed that with another dozen. Oysters do not get better than here. Then on to the crab salad- wife and I split that and we were not just happy but euphoric is closer. The value is very good but the experience is a Huge extra value for life. Make sure to observe the family resemblance the service team have. Generations. OK stand in line- yes. Only accept cash- yes- forget about it just go.

Did not even plan to come here if it hadn't been for my friend from San Jose who insisted we should try. I was already not looking forward to queueing for 2 hours on a rainy morning. We arrived pretty late for first seating assumption at 9.50 (the place opens at 10.30 for dine in) but since it just rained we found the line quite short than expected! So we were definitely thrilled to be seated in the first batch :) The vibe of this small place truly doesn't make you feel like you're dining in the middle of the city... it felt like being in a seafood market. Food was amazingly fresh!!! Had the chowder, the legendary crab salad, the clams and oysters, and the Sicilian sashimi - this was my first time trying a non-japanese sashimi and I must say I'm blown away...!! I had no more stomach space to try dungeness crabs or shrimps but I will make it a mission to try it again next visit! I don't mind a 2-hour line either!! So worth it! And come with empty stomach!

I came to San Francisco to celebrate my birthday and was told this was a must to dine. However I arrived at 2:30pm, I thought well enough before they close at 5:30pm, and a couple in front of me had a hand written sign given to them by the establishment saying "Last One." The gentleman holding the sign encouraged me not to fear, as I was dining alone and I should not have any trouble getting in. After standing for about an hour I called the restaurant and was told they provided carry out. I went into the restaurant, leaving about 35 people in line waiting. They only offer counter seating (about 20 seats) and the ones seated were not budging. This is a no frills restaurant but the seafood made up for any deficiencies in the ambience and standing for about an hour. The young man that prepared my food commented on my Ravens football top, and he was a bit gruff but that is really a part of the dining experience. I felt victorious when I left with my food, waving at the others in line. I went back to my hotel and enjoyed my meal. When I return to San Francisco I will most definitely return to the Swan Oyster Depot, but will arrive at 10:30am when their doors open. **** they do not accept credit cards.

Tonight, 11/17 we went at 10 before 5 and as we entered were told they stopped accepting new customers at 445, 5 minutes before we arrived. They would not budge and were rude. They claim to be open until 530 so we thought arriving 40 minutes before closing would be fine. If they stop accepting new customers at 445 they should clearly state that they close at 445, not falsely say they are open until 530. So I want to let others know about bad information.

All my friends in SF reminded me to visit Swan Oyster Depot. I arrived slightly after the restaurant opened at 10:30 and there's already a long queue for 20+ people in the rainy day. After queuing up for 90 minutes, I managed to get a seat. I got a lot of seafood want to try but I can't order too much as already have a big dinner plan... but still I got big uni, crab meat cocktails, a small clam chowder and half dozen mix of clams and oysters. I like the crab meat cocktails most as is really fresh and sweet. The big uni can't bid the Japanese one.Overall it's a good dining experience but next time is better to arrive before 10 am so hopefully don't need to queue for so long.

We waited 3.5 hours and I still give it 4 stars. 1. Culture: one of my favorite things about visiting an established city such as San Francisco is experiencing a family run place. The staff is friendly, efficient and playful with each other. The line while hard on the feet can be what you make it. We made friends with no less than 6 people which made the time pass despite sore pieds. 2. Fresh oysters: you watch them shuck 'em, the sauces are perfection but only use a dab so as to taste the bivalves. 3. Usually not so much for beer after standing for so long the cold Anchor Steam and Stella on tap accompanied our fare well. I liked the chowder; it is cream based but not pasty or very thick. It has more of a broth like consistency. We shared the crab Louis with bay shrimp which comes with the perfect dressing. Don't skip the bread and butter; after all you are here to eat. Prawns can be on their own so leave them off the Crab Louis salad. Go ahead and put a handful of oyster crackers in your chowder; you know you want to.

GET IN LINE EARLY!!!! We had read this over and over. We went on a Monday and were the first in line. Can you believe it??? We waited about an hour but its fun to watch how they set up all the seafood in the window and allows you to read the menu. Once were were seated we immediately ordered an Anchor steam beer and champagne. Then we ordered the crab back, 1 dungeness crab, sashimi, and 1 dozen oysters. The crab back was unique but I would have liked to try it hot instead of cold. The oysters were very fresh but they were west coast oysters which I do not love. The crab was cracked and tasted amazing. The sashimi was a mixture of tuna, halibut and scallops with olive oil and capers on top. All food was super fresh, but nothing in the place is served hot except the chowder. I would have enjoyed some melted butter with the crab. I do not think I would go back here, but it is quite the experience.

Small family owned restaurant that is always a must when we visit SF. Great oysters and always such nice service from the staff. Counter only seating, maybe about 15-20 seats and expect a line outside always. We arrived at about 1215 on a Tuesday and waited about 45mins. We tried something different to drink this time, their "Red Eye" and it is quite good and refreshing. It is a light beer with red cocktail sauce, either oyster juice or clam juice (sorry can't remember which one) lemon juice, Tabasco, horseradish and possibly a few more ingredients, Wow, different, but spicy and tasty!! Their clam chowder and bread is also so good and we usually start off with a piping hot cup of this on arrival. We love it here. Also added the sashimi plate this time, thumbs up on this a well.

Line up at 930am to eat oysters for breakfast when they open at 1030?! Can't say I'd ever had the pleasure until visiting SF for the labour day weekend. We had a few orders of crab, dipped in the salad dressing (amazing) the oysters were super fresh and the hand cut sashimi drizzled with olive oil and capers? Fantastic. Sashimi literally cut in the palm their hands bc who needs a cutting board when handling such delicate fresh fish. Real craftsmanship and down to earth hospitality. I liked how after returning the second plate of crab shells it was pointed out to me I missed a spot and was handed back a pinch of crab flesh to pop in my mouth. You feel like your part of something special when you visit this place!

OK, you wait, then you wait, and then you wait some more, BUT it's worth it. We arrived a 12:45, so it lunch, and the line is about 30 people long. Not having been there I had no idea what the turnover rate was. Imagine my surprise when I found out that the little 16 seat counter is THE only seating, so we had to experience 2 turnovers (2.5 hours). When we got the the door we were the first for the next wave. Within a couple of minutes one of the employees offered us beers which we jumped on, and in doing so struck up a conversation with what turned out to be one of the owners. We hit it off and he gave us the royal treatment once we were seated. We started comparing notes about east coast vs. west coast seafood, and experienced a wide sampling of their offerings. We spent about an hour at the counter, and made a new friend in the owner. So be patient, be friendly, be informed about seafood, and you can have a blast like we did.

There's very limited bar seating... despite the long lineup and slow turnover, but that's because the staff is friendly and takes their time to serve you and you never feel rushed. At first, I thought the seafood looked so plain but it was sooo fresh and delicious, it didn't need anything else. Sooo impressed!! Loved the experience! Highly recommended!!

So this place has been on our food destination bucket list for a few years--despite the occasional bad review, this is must do in SF--better than lots of tourist traps (although this is turning into a foodie must-do).First-- there's always a wait. Its a very little storefront with a glass window filled with fresh seafood, but if you look for the line on a sidewalk on Polk Street, you'll find the Swan Oyster Depot. We arrived at 10 am--the place opens at 10:30 am--and there was already a big line. There are only 15 or so stools at the counter--that's all the seating there is--and once those filled we had to wait for a few of them to empty. But it was worth the wait. The seafood is absolutely pristine--we started with a collection of west coast oysters--six varieties--and they were each slightly different but they were all fresh as they could be. (I actually ate another half-dozen of my favorite.) The crab cocktail is excellent--big chunks of leg and claw meat in a glass cocktail cup--opt for extra horseradish with the cocktail sauce. The crab-back filled with bits of crab-fat broth that you soak up with sourdough bread--a unique treat worth a try. We also shared a plate of sashimi drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with capers and onions--they come S, M, or L--as well as a recommended plate of smoked salmon--the salmon was so flavorful, I almost went with a second plate.The service is very good but very unique. Five or six guys are behind the counter and while one might be your main guy, the others are likely to just keep stopping by to be sure what you might want or need. The guy you order with will actually make your plate--the food is prepared and served by the same person. When you've had enough, ask for the bill-- they just ask what you had and they total it up. It's really old school eating and I can't wait to go back. Most of my reviews are at fancier places but I really left my heart at this rather diner basic seafood joint. (Couldn't resist that opportunity.)

In queue for 20 mins just for take away. Crab was watery and tasted like sawdust, prawns no flavour. Smoked salmon good but not outstanding, perhaps got bad day but how a family could serve up such food well aware it was neither good value for money but denigrated their name and reputation is beyond me. No wonder they have a sign up saying that they have no website and that any comments on one seen do not belong to them, such a pity. Perhaps most of their clients are one off tourists, after the rave they got on Master Chef Australia hopefully we ordered the wrong thing and it is better than our experience.
