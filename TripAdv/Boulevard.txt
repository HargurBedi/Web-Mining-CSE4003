My family and I celebrated my 70 birthday at Boulevard at my request because I can always depend on great food, great service in beautiful setting. And as always they really came through for us. The fall chopped salad, the King salmon, Lamb T-Bone, all were excellent. We bought our own special bottles of wine, and when they ran out , the waiter found a wine that fit so well with ours. What a fun evening!

I am reviewing this restaurant twice, and that is because I ate here two night in a row and had very different experiences. Which was eye opening to me, cause you know how you read some of these reviews and go it cant be that bad when there are ten times that saying this place is Great!. Well now I know. The people in the kitchen can make you or break you. Wait staff included. Enough of the prelude... First time here. The food was awesome! and the waitress, and older lady which is not typical in these swanky places in a downtown atmosphere , was awesome! In fact, I wish I got her name cause she was not there the next night and she was a true professional. The menu reads very well and it is hard to make a selection because it does sounds so good, which is one of the reasons I went back. All in all this place rocked from the food to the decor to the staff, it was all great! A must if your staying down by the pier or at the Hyatt. It was very very good! Could not have been more pleased. Seriously Wonderful evening.

We were seated at a table close to the entrance - it was very cold; my wife had to put on a down jacket to survive. The appetizer and and main dish wearer excellent but very tiny servings. Therefore we ordered one dessert but this dessert had more calories and sugar than all the rest of the meal. The servings are not balanced at all - the main dish was nice but at all worth the price. We will not come again!..

Kitchen Counter Dinner

Dinner at Boulevard with a friend, we didn't have a reservation and ended up being seated the counter with a birds eye view to all the action and the heat. The cooks really work up a sweat cooking. Everything looked delicious. I found my steak to be somewhat flavorless. No room left for dessert. Lots of atmosphere at Boulevard everywhere you look. Suggest making a reservation if you want a table. Very close the Golden Gate Bridge, nice option to walk off your dinner. The area is rife with street people.

Truly a perfect dinning experience, from the impeccable staff to the beautifully cooked food. I had a tuna tartar appetizer, friends had the soft shell crab and scallops, all were delicious. My main was the lamb which was served with homemade hummus, mint, and cauliflower. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. Friends had the pork and duck, the duck being he standout of the two. Butterscotch pudding was inventive and the perfect way to finish the meal. One of the most pleasant, perfectly timed, and overall positive experiences I have had at a restaurant. Seats by back have a great view of the Bay Bridge, dark interior with a masculine feel.

Just superb food: halibut, lamb and steak at our table, tomato salad, green salad made up, the best and most creative creme carmel EVER,raves all around. Extraordinary wine list. Waiter very good, though perhaps just a touch on the hurried side. Cleared my salad before I was quite done. Still, an experience to be savoured for a long time.

The dishes at Boulevard were fantastic. I had the Filet Mignon and wife had Pork Chop. We were both going back and forth from our dishes because we like them both so much. As the sun set we had a great view of Bay Bridge which was nice. And their wine selection was fantastic. I rarely go for dessert where I eat dinner but we were so comfortable in our little couch for two that we stayed and were not disappointed. The waiter was super nice and friendly as well as the rest of the staff. I would definitely recommend to all my friends to come here if they are in San Francisco but I will remind them to bring their wallet, not cheap.

We've been visiting Boulevard for a decade or more while in San Francisco. It's hard enough to create an excellent restaurant, but even more to maintain that standard over the years but they have certainly done that.Boulevard has an Art Nouveau atmosphere with lots of stone, wood, and decorative elements. The service is polished and professional while seeming friendly and helpful at the same time. The food is simply outstanding - inventive without being weird, perfectly prepared, and delicious.In a town with so many top-notch restaurants, Boulevard is a stand-out.

I went to Boulevard with a large group of girls. The atmosphere in the private wine room was beautiful. They had a sommelier on site which added to atmosphere. We had called in advance to let them know we had vegans and vegetarians joining. Unfortunately our meals were not creative or exciting. We simply were given a dish of seasoned vegetables. They were done well but for $29 a plate of just vegetables (no sauce or starch) was quite disappointing. We have them free range to get creative and it was the opposite. The sorbet was good!

Our group of seven recently vacationed in San Francisco and chose Boulevard as the site for our "fancy dinner" one evening. The best word to describe the food, the service and the entire experience is outstanding. One person in our party had a special request due to a food allergy and our server went out of her way to ensure that the kitchen staff handled it properly.The staff at Boulevard provided the exact type of experience that you would expect at one of the best restaurants in The City and we were not disappointed. Would definitely return.

The decor is part mid-western steak house, part European Art Nouveau, part Wild Wild West. The decor, the ambience, the clientele, the staff, and of course the food are nothing if not interesting. We had a window booth, but this booth faces in. We had a ring side view of the Boulevard. We had already enjoyed three days of over-eating so the night at the Boulevard we were moderate in our approach. We had entrees, as it happened the same, a kind salmon served with small shrimp, perfectly prepared legumes and a few vegetables ... with a sorrel aioli. We usually do no have desert, but I could not resist the temptation of raspberry sorbet. Yummm. There is a good reason this restaurant was a recipient of a James Beard award.

Boulevard was a lovely restaurant with great ambiance. We had a corner table in the front of the restaurant which was very nice but the acoustics in the room made it a little loud. The food was really delicious - my husband had the Ahi Tuna tartare which he really enjoyed and I had the Feta, summer cucumbers and Avocado which was refreshing and light. we both enjoyed the Halibut which was delicious. For dessert the Milky was Bombe was the go-to dessert for a chocolate lover and the berries were my husbands favorite. Very relaxed dinner and great food! Location is nice near the embarcado so great views of the bridges at night. Enjoy a great meal.

We asked our local friends to recommend somewhere nice for dinner. We were a party of four for an early dinner reservation. If one likes big Resturant's then this is the place you want to go to. The wine collection was excellent. We ordered one white and one red average price of $ 125.The food was below average we ordered foie gras and burrata which were just average. The main course consisted of T Bone lamb chops and fillet steak both horrible the sides seemed that they were cooked couple of days back. Our bill with the tip was over $ 750. Not worth the food we ate. The service was not good for an upmarket Resturant like this.

Decor: 5 stars. Comfortable and interesting decor with spacious booth for our group of four. Note that there are tables for two along a busy railing near food delivery area. Food: 4 stars. For entrees, two of us had the halibut and it was excellent though a small portion. One person had salmon, also excellent and a nice size portion. One person had the pork chop and it was highlight at our table, though there was a nasty vein running through an end of the meat. We were comped an extra dessert for the poor cut of what was an otherwise delicious preparation of the pork. Service: 4 stars.This was my second visit to this restaurant and I would definitely go back on a return trip to San Francisco. As an added bonus you can see a wonderful view of the illuminated Bay Bridge from the restaurant at night.

Nice buzzy room with good space between tables. Extremely busy at 6pm on a thurs evening. We dined with our kids aged 8 and 11. Kids were offered a simple pasta option but ordered from main menu. Food was ok but uninspiring. I believe has a Michelin star - if so backs up my theory that the threshold is significantly lower in theUS than Europe. Ingredients were sound and appeared well sourced but there was no 'wow' with anything and frankly did not justify the price ( entrees $40+). Scallops - plump (only 2 though....) but just bland I'm afraid. Duck - very good breast panfried. The confit accompanying was superb but minuscule which was a shame.Lamb dish was good but we ordered 3 cooked medium (2 were for the kids) and one was served blue. Not sure what happened there but my wife couldn't eat most of it. To be fair they did remove from the bill before I asked for it. Wine list was good and I was particularly impressed with the half bottle selection. They have great relationships with some of the local producers hence things like kistler half bottles and mags on the list (super rare). In summary, nice room, staff competent but not terribly friendly, ok food not worth the price point or the Michelin star. Not on my list of places to return to.

this is our third visit to this restaurant- some friends joined us for the evening, and it was underwhelming overall. Background music too loud; such that the ambience was ruined. Waiter appeared disinterested in his service; did not engage well, and when he suggested the sommelier to help out with wines matters did not improve much. Lost in translation; or just not wanting to engage. We weren't keen on a very large oaky chardonnay to go with the fish; and indicated that a lighter style would be good= the recommendation ended up being an un-oaked Chardonnay which was Ok but not what we had asked for. Food was average; experience not one to remember except for the unmemorable service.

Ok if you want a burger or pizza this ain't the place for you. It's very much fine dining and the food is amazing. The service is attentive without being over bearing which is great. The scallop starter is divine. The only negative and it's a small negative is that being very much in demand it's a tad loud. This is only human talk noise though so not an issue but if you want a quiet meal again this might not work.

My wife and I come here about once a year, often for a special occasion. This time we were staying in the city for a long weekend and we decided to include a Sunday night dinner at Boulevard (making reservations by phone several weeks in advance).My wife is a vegetarian and they always accommodate her by making up a special vegetable entree (not on the menu). This time the plate was the best ever.I had the salmon and it was perfectly prepared. The service was impeccable, attentive, informed, and comfortable but not overly attentive or obsequious.Boulevard is somewhat expensive, but worth every dollar.We like to try new restaurants, but I think we will continue to come here at least once a year.

As much as San Francisco has changed with the tech boom and gentrification of historically seedy areas, some things stay the same. How refreshing to come back to The City after too long an absence and find Boulevard still here, still thriving, in this gorgeous Belle Epoque building that survived the Fire of 1906 when little else did. And the food's as outstanding as ever. As is the service and the expansive wine list. Can't recommend it highly enough.

"Boulevard" is noted chef Nancy Oakes' brainchild. It was awarded the James Beard Award a couple of years ago, and the food and service are still the best in town.Nancy always gets the best local, organic ingredients, the hallmark of 21st Century fine cuisine. The fin-de-siecle motif and the broad, airy views of San Francisco Bay from windows on three side of the restaurant only add to the experience. My wife and I had our first evening together at Boulevard, an experience we'll never forget. We've been back enough to be considered regulars. We enjoy chatting with servers who have been with the restaurant since it opened in 1992. On my birthday a couple of years ago, my wife arranged with the staff at Boulevard to meet our hired 1930s Rolls-Royce at curbside with a bottle of Champagne. Every eye in the restaurant was on us, and we supped and drank with royal ambience at our favorite table. 'S'fun!Highly recommended.

Everything about customer service was slow, other than initially being seated. We always had to summon a server. For pre dinner drinks they couldn't provide slimline tonic for a G&T. Wine list is extensive but expensive, for the wines you get. We had to wait ages for our main course, and had to chase its whereabouts 3 times before it eventually appeared. Both were very good, but for relatively straightforward dishes there had to be another reason for the delay in it appearing. Equally we passed on dessert, but ordered two glasses of pudding wine. I am still at a loss to understand how it takes 15 minutes to pour and deliver two very small glasses of wine. This is a smart, expensive restaurant and the speed of service fell substantially short of expectations. On this performance allow plenty of time

Our first visit to what is clearly a well established and admired institution. Service was seamless and professional. Beautiful tiled floors and bar area and brick ceiling from the entrance. The wine list is comprehensive and from numerous countries and wine regions and quite reasonably priced for a restaurant of this standing, except for the Batard Montrachet at $850.We shared a scallop entree, a big one each which were perfectly cooked and presented. My wife's main of pork chop was generously sized and remarkably tender. Not many places seem to be able to perfect the humble pork chop and my fillet steak was predictably sized and also tender.We matched our meal with a Napa wine described as a Rhone, by which it meant a Grenache Shiraz blend but without the Mouvedre often seen with a true Cote de Rhone.Wrapped up with a shared butterscotch custardy thing which we both enjoyed. We were pleased to be able to appreciate their well earned reputation

When you go to a fine dining restaurant in San Francisco, don't whine about the cost. There is very little in terms of bargains.Once you accept this you can enjoy the experience.Our dinner was a most wonderful time.We noticed that the menu did not have a lot of entree choices but they were all enticing.We started with appetizers. The was a ravilolini dish and lobster with risotto Both were excellent with subtle flavors that made them fun. The entrees chosen included steak, halibut and salmon. The presentation was beautiful which caused my wife to insist on photographing themI had salmon which literally melted in my mouth. Fantastic stuffThe wine list is extensive and allowed one a wide choice of prices we enjoyed a 2010 Bordeaux from St Emilion which was great.Our server was attentive and very friendly even taking pictures of us at our table for usWe all had dessert which included carrot cake, bon bons fresh fruit and chocolate marble ice creamThe cost for the 4 of us excluding tip was$475, which was in line with the quality of our experience.

This was an embarrassing experience.The place is very expensive and expectations are correspondingly high but the restaurant fell short by quite some way.The server initially showed considerable inflexibility in addressing the needs, readily met elsewhere, of one of our partt.The appetizers were very good.But the problems with one of the entrees were indicative of rank carelessness. The duck breast dish was cold when it arrived and when it was re-presented. Only at the third attempt did the kitchen get it right. And then, having informed us that an appropriate adjustment would be made to the check, it was not, until expressly requested of the manager.Embarrassing and just not good enough.

A working dinner, but in a very nice setting, great food, and fantastic service.My host had been here many times before, and knows the staff. They were quick with his choice of wine, and we had some tasty appetizers. For my entree I ordered the huge pork chop....very tasty, and with a variety of flavorful accompanying side dishes. We were all too full for dessert, but did get a complementary plate of 'lollipop' cakes on a stick....yum.One of the nicest 'fine dining' restaurant I've visited in years. Because of the great food and amazing service, I'm sure the restaurant is always booked to capacity.

Excellent as expected

We love this Resturant . The ambiance is wonderful. No surprises tonight as we had a wonderful table in the corner and could see the people. Cocktails were good. We had foie gras and abalone carbonara as starters and then the sole and halibut. Both excellent . The wine list is extensive and reasonable. Highly recommend.

We went here for a business dinner and I have to say I left hoarse. We needed to shout at the top of our lungs just to hear each other. Food was ok but not sure it matches the price. For a city like SF with so many great restaurants you can do much better.

Good, but superficial sophistication

Had a preset dinner with larger group. The scallops as appetizer were very good, well prepared, but lacked complexity. The fillet mignon well prepared, but quite frankly not memorable. The desert, a combination of ice cream and a little pie good but nothing special. Service was outstanding. 

Overrated, overpriced.

The only indication of this joint being worthwhile was that it was crowded and loud. Decent wine and knowledgeable waiter. Very jolly, but that's all that recommends this place.

Wonderful experience

Beautiful vintage decor; service and food are amazing. Highly recommend the tuna tartare with nori chips, the lamb and the carrot cake. They make a good martini too. 

Memorable service, very good foid

Had been to Boulevard in Its venerable building years ago and read some recent reviews that it might be fading a bit from previous high ratings. Sat at the bar and had memorable service and very good food. Arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday to find many folks just arriving. Service from Deva was thoughtful, thorough, attentive and went far beyond the usual on a very busy evening. Reminded me of how much service contributes to the experience of a good restaurant.Highly recommend. 

One of the very Best Values in San Fran

Normally the restaurants that cater to tourists are of average quality food wise and high price otherwise but this place I am happy to say has it all, great atmosphere inside, first class service, the food was very good and the price well you're in San Francisco and all the restaurants are over priced for the quality but all in all this is as good as we have found in the downtown core. Reservations are recommended as this place is booked every night except Sundays. My swordfish was as perfect as anywhere that I have been able to enjoy good seafood and so I recommend it. Our table of four all had different meals and everyone was very pleased with their food. With a glass of modestly priced wine and a shared dessert and coffee you will pay about $50-60 per head, which for San Fran is not too bad.

OMG it was amazing!

There is food, and then there is Boulevard, which takes food to a whole different level. I ordered what my waitress recommended and I am glad that I did. Everything was fabulous. The foie gras melted in my mouth and was the best I have ever had. It was a great dinner--I don't go to SF often, it's been ~20 years since I last ate here......I remember it as being wonderful then and it still is now. Can't wait to go back!

Fabulous dinner, top rate staff, beautiful views

Came here for a business dinner. All of us ordered seafood: ahi tuna, white prawn and abalone appetizers. Halibut and sea scallops entrees. Bon bons, chocolate and caramel dessert. Every dish was delicious. Staff was very attentive. A memorable meal.

A spectacular dining experience...

I recently dined at Boulevard while attending a conference in San Francisco. Everything was absolutely first-rate - from the service to the cocktails to the entrees. The pork chop was among the best I have ever eaten. While it's not cheap, neither is it break-the-bank expensive. If you are in that part of town, check it out; you will not be disappointed!

Lovely dinner

Loved my dinner. The raviolini was superb... followed by the scallops. Each ingredient on the plate served a purpose and when you combined them for a perfect bite, it was really delicious. Finished off the meal with a single bon bon just for something sweet.Service was wonderfully welcoming and professional.

Just Fantastic!

My Favorite San Francisco Restaurant - I'm A Local
Rating: 5
Date: April 13, 2017
This restaurant is the place that I go for Birthdays and special occasions, yet it is good any time. I also take visitors from out of town here. The food is always outstanding with a great selection that changes with the seasons. The pork is always a favorite and they do an outstanding job with fish. When on the menu, the Halibut is excellent and I'm not even a big fish fan. The view of the Bay Bridge is beautiful if you are in the room near the back. The place has an elegant yet down to earth vibe. If you are visiting, or local, this is a must do restaurant.

Still nice, but.....

A family favorite since Nancy Oakes' Avenue days. This time we did a dinner for 8 with 6 being international guests who had not been before. They all seemed to love it, food, service, ambience and the way the staff handled the magnum I brought in. My wife and I, being picky Bay Area foodies, found the current menu a tad limited and the actual food not quite as tasty as on our many previous visits. The staff were terrific and it was indeed a successful evening, but not quite up to my expectations. 

Always a must!

We were able to visit Boulevard again for our annual trip. The food was perfection and service good as usual. We needed to hurry more than usual since we were heading to the Orpheam to see Hamilton, so the full dining experience was limited. However, we enjoyed every bite and can't wait to return!

Still Wonderful

Boulevard remains one of San Francisco's most pleasant restaurants. On a recent lunch, the food was as excellent as always and the service impecible. It's location is so convenient with the F-line (historic) streetcar stop just a short block away, the interior is light and lovely and the atmosphere intimate and comfortable. 

A lovely meal with just a few negatives

Booked in advance of our trip to SF (a must, especially on the weekend). Started with a drink at the bar. Gorgeous cocktails! Our seat wasn't ideal - we were crammed in with a group of 4 lads very close to us. The restaurant was also pretty cold. I kept my jacket on for the entire meal. The starters and mains however were delicious. I started with the tuna carpaccio, my husband had the ravioli-both exceptional. Our choices of mains were halibut and pork chops. The halibut was cooked beautifully-flakey and moist, I couldn't fault it. The pork chops were a recommendation of the server and not something my husband would normally go for but he also thoroughly enjoyed them. There were no sides offerings on the menu but extra bread was served to accompany our mains which satisfied our carb cravings! We didn't want desserts as we were both too full but were served complimentary delicious cookie dough chocolate balls to finish. Service was very good. We would return when back in SF

I went here for a business dinner. I lived in SF for a number of years, and this was then, and still, my favorite restaurant in SF. I can't say too much other than its perfect, every time.

Boulevard is another great restaurant in San Francisco. The ambience is perfect, the service is fantastic and their food delicious! They have great cocktails & wine menu! It's elegant and if you don't hear anyone speaking French that would be the first time! Boulevard has the touch of Alice Waters(Chex Panne) in the sense its farm to table! You need a reservation and it's best to walk or take uber/lift. Cheers!

Great restaurant - go there!

What a great spot! Perfect wait staff, many of whom have been here for a number of years and lend their expertise freely! Quaint and cozy with a French bistro feel! All of the menu choices were great and I had a difficult time choosing...they all sounded great! The pork chop is renown and for good reason! Everything is simply and well presented ! Save room for dessert! You can walk it off on the way back to your hotel!

You can't go wrong at this downtown favorite with delicious, bistro style food in a quintessential SF setting. Lively bar, thick wine list, and solid food, delighting a variety of palates. Attentive service. There is a lot of competition in this foodie city but for an occasion dinner, or straightforward business dinner, it's always a great choice.
