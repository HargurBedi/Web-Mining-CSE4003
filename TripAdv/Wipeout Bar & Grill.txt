Entered restaurant ( more a cafeteria) at 7.30 pm and completed meal by 8.05!.Starters and mains!Starters arrived with one waiter, only for mains to arrive 30 seconds later."We're quite tonight, thse waiter advised as he moved on to next table.Cheque arrived as last mouthfull of food passed my lips. As for the food, it was pretty good, hence the upgrade to 2 stars.Not the place for a romantic night out.

Pros - food is ok, for the price- staff is really nice and friendly- has lots of screens to watch sports - has a relaxed environment in general- surfer style and music Cons- The waiting time is awful- The organisation seems a bit all over the placePlease be sure to specify whether you want to eat outside or inside, waiting times vary

My friends and I came here for lunch and the place was a little busy but worth the short wait! I had craving for fried cod fish and fries and my friends had the fish and shrimp tacos each and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! It was delicious! The service, food, and ambiance were great! The drinks were the bomb! My friends had the shark something drink and I had the top shelf margarita we loved the drinks! Oh and just heads up the restrooms are unisex...this had a lot of people looking for restroom very confused when they were looking for bathroom and saw men and women standing in line...it was kind of comical too though...Lol!

The restaurant was very busy both times but this didn't impact the service at all. Price is also very good especially with the location. Give it a go.

My first visit to Outback, half our drinks order arrived and we had to ask for the rest of them. Steaks were overcooked, don't believe the picture in the menu, if you ask for rare you get med, if you ask for medium you get well done. I sent mine back and it was still more done than the picture but I ate it anyway because the rest of my group were nearly finished.

Breakfast on Saturday
Rating: 3
Date: October 2, 2017
Stopped in on a clear, nice Saturday morning. Plenty of people at the outside tables, hardly anyone inside, so we went inside and ordered bloody mary's and breakfast. Servers were nice and checked on us often. However, the bloody marys came about 5 minutes after we were served breakfast. Made well, but would have preferred for them to come before we began eating. Food was so-so. Potatoes were cool to cold. Ordered eggs over medium, got them completely cooked through and they were very brown, like they had been cooked under a steak press. I guess they weren't really ready to be up and running at full speed that day. Nice atmosphere, motif entirely wrapped around the surfer beat. Would probably not go there for anything other than the bloody mary's if I had the time to wait.

Funny plastic plates

Normally I am easily happy with just basic food and I would have declared myself happy with the food at this place as everything was perfect.... if it wasn't for the very funny plastic plates, as if I am a baby to break them.The place is located in the busy area of Pier 39 on the left hand side as you step on the pier, it is very lively and had a huge crowd outside. We chose to stay inside and everything was very efficient. One other thing which I found funny, was sharing the toilet cubicles with men as the toilet was mixed.

Obviously since it's on Pier 39. it's geared toward tourists, but you still won't go wrong by eating here.

This place has a huge patio, inside and outside bar, inside dining, good beer, and friendly service. Great lively atmosphere. Yep, it's crowded, but they have lots of seating and we waited only 10 minutes for a table for 4 at peak lunch time during tourist season. When you are grabbing lunch with your kids in the middle of a tourist trap, it becomes more about a good kids menu with adult food options of salads, sandwiches, entrees, and good drinks! Our server was really nice and upbeat (Wilfredo?), but the kitchen was a little slow...but that's ok because they have a good beer selection and TVs playing surfer videos. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, but it's a great lunch spot if you are visiting Pier 39 and Fisherman's Warf.

Vacationing with my 2 kids by myself was proving challenging. I walked by and saw coronas, a patio, and tacos. Score! I had a packed stroller with me for my 4 yr old, which I saw being a problem. They had a spot for stroller parking! We asked to sit on the patio and they seated us quickly. The food was priced appropriately (remembering were in San Francisco) and arrived quickly. The portions aren't tiny, nor are they giant. The salsa is spicy, but so good. I couldn't decide on a beer, so my server graciously brought me samples and explained more about each beer. If you're a pigeon lover like myself, the pigeons weren't a problem, but they do walk around the patio waiting for you to drop food. Especially near my youngest son, who kept feeding them despite the signs and me telling him not to.The staff was so friendly. If you have kids, you know...sometimes they don't listen and it's so exhausting constantly correcting them vs enjoying your meal. I felt terrible the pigeons were flocking, but the servers were so nice and didn't make a big deal about it. They would walk by and spray them and the food my son dropped to detour them. It was very relieving that they weren't condescending and more understanding. My kids went to play at the playground close by and I sat finishing my half of a beer. While in the bathroom, the busser pulled it thinking I was finished. The server apologized and promptly brought me a new, FULL beer.Overall, the food was great, but the customer service was better. LOTS of seating. Great place to take the family. Cute bar. Fantastic drinks. I will definitely train my kids not to feed pigeons and be back soon!

(see my Pier 39 review for the other reasons you might want to go there)I have eaten at this place on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed in either the quality of food or the service,Great custom burgers, tasty fries, coconut shrimp, fish tacos... even veggie items and salads. Wipeout could have easily sold out to the overpriced fast food vibe found at other P39 restaurants. Instead, they offer a veritable cornucopia of pseudo-surfer cuisine that will satiate the appetites of everyone from post-hot-yoga workout moms to Ukrainian computer nerds on vacation, to actual surfers, to locals dropping by for lunch and a beer. Reasonably priced and generously portioned, Wipeout's offerings will fill you up without emptying your wallet. If you like seafood, grab some coconut shrimp and/or fish tacos or battered fish. If you;re a meat-eater, then one of the large, sloppy burgers with fresh avocado should be right up your alley. Pair it with some outrageous onion rings or sweet potato fries, top it off with a cold brew, and you won't be hungry the rest of the day. Ambience: Very nice California vibe with just the right touch of funk and whimsy., Probably not a good choice for a first date due to it being excessively noisy at times and often overrun with rug rats. (aka: "kids") Fun overall atmosphere.
