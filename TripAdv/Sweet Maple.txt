Absolutely loved this place, by far the best breakfast place we found during our two week trip in California. Millionaires bacon is like no bacon you've ever had before. The French Toast literally melts in your mouth. The Mexican Chorizo Scrambled Egg thing was Ridiculous!!!!!!!

Living in San Francisco has its Perks....But Having the Best Brunch Place to indulge just a walking Distance from you Home ? This is the Place....Quick tip...On Weekends just make sure you arrived 2 hours after they Open. Enjoy their Unlimited Mimosa( of course you pay for it) Their Choices for Eggs Benedict is Awesome !!! Big Serving with Fast service...I'll Have my Breakfast here on the DOT..( Be Courteous enough to Dine-in and Leave) but to Chat while you see an Enormous line outside? I Strongly Suggest this place...Quality and Great Service...

Every review no doubt mentions the long line outside Sweet Maple. Yes, you will have to wait, but it is worth it. When you finally get inside you will have a delicious breakfast in no time as the service is quick. This spot is popular with tourists and locals alike. Tip: avoid coming with a large group, if you are just two people you may save yourself 30 min by opting to have your breakfast at the bar.

We've eaten here a couple times now and there is generally a long line to get in. The food is very good but most of the items on the menu are done with a twist (slightly different than usual). Some may like this, we prefer more mainstream dishes. We tried their specialty, millionaire's bacon which is bacon prepared with sugar and syrup I believe (sweet and savory) which we were not a huge fan of. My wife liked the waffles, my daughter and I seem to struggle to find something that's not too weird to eat. Obviously I don't represent the masses that line up to eat here, so this place does have an appeal for a lot of people.

Really Long Wait

We waited for over an hour at this restaurant, basically out of curiosity about what the fuss was all about. We got standard brucn hstaples (scrambles, pancakes, french toast) and tried the sweet maple bacon. Everything was good, but not spectacular; not really worth the wait.

Long lines, worth the wait!

Two words - "millionaire's bacon". We try to come here for breakfast/brunch, however plan for a long wait. They normally have free coffee for when you wait so that helps (if you are a coffee drinker). They have all the breakfast staples - omlettes, pancakes, french toast, etc, but if it comes with the millionare's bacon, get it. It is thick cut bacon that has been slow cooked with brown sugar to make a delicious sweet crust. The salty sweet result is to die for.Good luck with street parking!

Holy cow this place was fantastic! If you like breakfast then you MUST visit this brunch spot. Menu has a number of eggs benedict variations, each more tantalizing than the last.

Be prepared to wait in line when you get there - it went pretty fast 20 mins - so worth it!

We went to this place in the middle of the week. We were nervous to go, due to reading reviews and they all said this place usually has a line out the door by 9:00. We arrived shortly after 9:00 and were seated right away. I ordered the deep fried French toast after reading multiple reviews on how good it was. I decided to add banana and candied walnuts to mine. The French toast was AMAZING. I love crispy/fried texture and it was just that. Also ordered the millionaire bacon. Was nervous about this also since I had read a review that it was a little spicy. I thought it was PERFECT. Definitely a unique flavor and a must have!All staff were very happy and provided great service. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants a delicious breakfast!

The Millionaires Bacon, the potato medley and my Hass Omelet was fresh, tasty and overall a very good breakfast. However, the coffee was lukewarm and lacked flavour, the service was ordinary and we were rushed thru our meal because 'the line outside was getting too long'. Unfortunately, like a number of eatery's service let's the food down.

Thanks to Trip Advisor we were able to find this place on our visit to SF. The portions were good and the food was delicious. The prices were in the ballpark of other restaurants we ate at so all things considered it was well worth it. The millionaires bacon is damn good but I'm not sure it's quite worth $2/piece.

We stumbled across this little gem while wandering around the neighborhood. We were able to get a table right away even though they were slammed, which was good because we were starving! We ordered quickly, figuring there would be quite a wait to get food (and there was). I ordered the french toast dish with a side of the millionaire's bacon, while my husband ordered an omelette. The french toast was nicely done -- not soggy, not too crispy -- but the bacon stole the show. It was even so good that my husband, a notorious non-food-sharer, kept stealing bites! It was a little pricy and service could have been faster, but overall for a busy place like this, that was expected. We 100% would go there again.

I've heard great things about this place so we wanted to make sure we got there right at 8am to beat the line. Glad we did, by the time we finished, a line outside had already formed. Ordered a sweet mimosa-- raspberry lemonade and champagne. Right up my alley. Not for everyone, however, it was sour-- but delicious! Also ordered a vanilla latte... eh. It wasn't the best. Probably wasn't worth what we paid for it. Then the food! We didn't order the millionaire bacon because I do not eat pork, but I did see pretty much everyone else did. It must have been awesome! I ordered the deep fried french toast. Shew, it was amazing. It tasted like I was eating a funnel cake. I also got egg whites and chicken mango sausage. Everything was great. Pricey, but delicious. If you love breakfast, I would definitely check this place out.

I had been out of the country for a week and I was dying to have a decent all American breakfast. My friend stated that she had been told that the Sweet Maple had a great Saturday breakfast/brunch. So right after arriving at SFO we went straight to the Sweet Maple.It was early .. around 8:00 am and we feared there would be a line like many have said there would be .. but to our great surprise there was non and we were seated as soon as we walked in. I ordered a egg omelet with asparagus and millionaire bacon with fresh Orange juice .. WOW is the only thing I can say.Be advise this isn't a cheap place but I thought it was worth it .. The service was friendly and as we were there the place got full but our waiter and waitress were excellent. Friend had traditional eggs and bacon with chai-tea and she said it was great.Come with an appetite ... portions are NOT small ...Well worth it !!!Upon leaving there was a line of almost 30 people outside ... wow ... it was true about the line.

This was our first time at this establishment. I've always subscribed to the theory that if there is a line around the block at a restaurant, they must be doing something right!Hubby and I stopped in here for brunch on our last morning in San Francisco, and when we pulled up to the joint, the line was SO LONG. You don't put your name on a list, you just stand in a designated line. A nice lady behind us told us not to worry; the line moves quick! And she was right!We waited in line about 15 minutes before being seated (we were guessing we'd be in line about an hour). Super friendly and efficient staff; we ended up taking a seat at he very comfortable bar. We ordered the "Millionaire's Bacon" (you'll kick yourself if you don't order this), the chicken curry scramble and the southern benedict. Five stars across the board! It's ok the high end of mid-range dining, but worth every penny. Make this part of your itinerary while in San Francisco!

We took an early flight from the east coast and landed at SFO around 8:00 AM, so we wanted to go into the city to find a place for breakfast. My wife did a Yelp search and came up with Sweet Maple as a place to go. We headed into the city and found parking about 2 blocks away and walked over to Sweet Maple. When we got there, we had to wait in a short line but that gave us some time to look over the menu and decide on what we wanted. We ordered coffee, which I loved because of the dark and bitter blend. She ordered a Mimosa and I went for the Beer-mosa because every breakfast needs juice with a little alcohol. We split an omelette, but I noticed signs and t-shirts advertising their Millionaire's Bacon, so of course we had to try it. Next time I go, I'm going to just order a few plates of the Millionaire's Bacon and nothing else....well the beer-mosa too! This is the BEST bacon I have ever had. I usually like the extra crispy style bacon, but this was thick and really meaty with a sweet and savory flavor that finished with a touch of heat from the pepper flakes. It's not super salty and it's definitely one of those items that you crave for the rest of the day. The omelette was delicious as well, but the star of this place is definitely the Millionaire's Bacon. We sat at the bar and the service was excellent there. I highly recommend this place if you are in San Francisco. Some of the other reviews mention that it's a bit pricey, which is probably spot on, but it's San Francisco and I was anticipating a higher bill. Great place to start off the trip!

My friend raved about this Millionaire Bacon. We tend to have the same palate so I grudgingly agreed to stand in the exhaustive line for Sweet Maple. We waited about 45 mins, and the line moved about every 5-10 mins. They were nice enough to provide coffee outside while you wait. When we were finally seated, we were ready to order (had 45 mins to decide)! The food arrived very quickly! I ordered eggs and the Dixie Bacon with potatoes. My friend ordered the same with Millionaire Bacon and we spilt French toast . I guess I didn't read the description of Dixie Bacon because it was not tasty.....deep fried crunchy coating no thanks! Now, the Millionaire Bacon was amazing!!! The French toast was excellent! I will definitely return!

We visited the Bay area in late July and Sweet Maple was in close proximity to our Airbnb. We needed a good breakfast before a day of exploring and this foot the bill nicely. Awesome food, quiet atmosphere and friendly service. This was an excellent first impression of San Francisco. I was a bit skeptical at first of the Millionaire's Bacon. I mean bacon is awesome, but there's only so much you can do to it. Definitely worth it! Extra thick and spicy.The menu is slightly overwhelming with the options - but that's just more incentive to come back another time!

We were able to walk to Sweet Maple from our hotel, which was fun! The restaurant was only a 10 min. walk to the Painted Ladies as well. The service was impeccable and many servers checked to make sure we never had an empty glass! We ordered the Big Hip (deep fried french toast), Millionaire's Bacon, and the Bay Bottom Omelette (crab, scallops, and asparagus). My husband said it was the best omelette he had ever tasted, and the Big Hip was presented in a fun way and tasted like a funnel cake! I wasn't "in love" with Millionaire's Bacon, but I thought it was good and it was nice to try it after reading so much about it (seems to be at several breakfast spots in the city). I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Sweet Maple was a fair place for breakfast, but I fail to see the huge attraction. I did not have the maple bacon because it doesn't appeal (love bacon though!), so maybe the place simply does not appeal to my taste. For visitors to San Francisco, maybe the appeal is a larger, familiar, and comfortable breakfast place? Others I can think of along these lines is Ella's nearby and Zazie in Cole Valley (smaller and more character IMO).If I'm going to stand in line for breakfast, I would prefer grabbing coffee and a pastry (or 2!) at Neighbor, Tartine, and B.Patisserie, but there is no sit down service at these places. For sit down service and a special location, I would choose the Cliff House Bistro. For the food, sit down service, and something out of the mainstream, I would choose Plow.

We lucked out and managed to get a table right at a moment when there was no line up. Our server lost points for not knowing the dish my daughter wanted was gluten free and trying to direct us to the 'plain' eggs items instead. She didn't know that corn tortillas didn't contain gluten and didn't want to ask but I insisted, which generated a scowl. This after she upsold our coffees to Americanos and Capaccinos. I wasn't pleased with the attitude. After this hiccup, our food swiftly arrived and was amazing. Food quality and atmosphere gets top marks. Food knowledge and being accommodating of Celiac Disease loses marks, like pretty much everywhere we went in SF.

We ate here on a Monday morning at the suggestion of our friend. It was probably around 9am when we got there and there was a line but we were seated almost right away since we didn't mind sitting outside. We ordered french toast, the crab omelette and a side of the Millionaire's Bacon. This was some of the best breakfast I've had in years...I can only think of one other place in California that compares. The french toast was perfectly crisp on the edges and fluffy on the inside. The omelette had a wonderful flavor and the bacon...I don't really even like bacon but I loved their bacon! Overall, the service was wonderful, the food was delicious and I'm already looking forward to my next trip here.

Nice Breakfast but long queue

My wife and I had breakfast at Sweet Maple on our last day in San Francisco.The "signature dish" is the "Millionaire's bacon", available in all options of the menu. Basically, it's a slow roasted tall slice of bacon seasoned with brown sugar, peppercorn and other spices. It's very good if you love the savory-sweet combination.Our breakfast dishes were really nice, but service could improve: it took us a real long time to be served (around 30 minutes to take our orders) - waiters/waitresses seemed understaffed that day.It's also important to say that if you want to be served fast, arrive very early! We got there 15 minutes before opening, on a Sunday and the line was already big. My guess is that people arriving late would wait for at least 40 minutes, but if you are not in a hurry, I think it's worth. I'll come back for sure.Hope you enjoy!

The BEST BRUNCH

This is an exceptional place for brunch or lunch! The menu has a wide variety of sweet and savory meal options. Of course, the Millionaire's Bacon was exceptional...it sound spicy but isn't very. The bottomless fresh raspberry and lemonade mimosa was wonderful, and the Big Hip deep-fried french toast was fabulous! There are a number of vegetarian options on the menu as well. I wish we would have had time to eat there every day; we would not have tired of it.

The SM Omurice is amazing! So is the coffee---dark, rich, flavorful! Back to the breakfast...scrambled egg over spinach, rice and bulgogi, topped with a Sriracha demiglace. Whoaaaa...so good. It comes with perfectly cooked potatoes. Can't wait to go back!

Get everything!

What a wonderful breakfast place that lives up to its reputation and ratings. Great selection of items including items for kids. Lively atmosphere and pretty good setup for kids. The self-serve coffee stand on the sidewalk is a very nice touch. Seems like you can wait up to 20 minutes for a party of 4 on the weekends, which we did on both Saturday and Sunday. As for the food, I recommend the pancakes, eggs Benedict, the millionaire sandwich, and chicken curry scramble. All delicious.

Great spot for Breakfast! and the food is delicious! Heads up that you will stand in line if you are not there at the opening. The menu is varied and if you have a sweet tooth, Millonaire's Bacon will surely fit the bill as the bacon has been cured in Maple Syrup!If you want to go light, you may want to order several side dishes....and they also have fruit to complement your meal. Delicious!

Great breakfast

We walked a long way to get to this cafe and it was worth every kilometre. We were promptly seated at our table and brought cool water. The menu had a lot to choose from, but I wanted to try the well known millionaires bacon so I ordered eggs. The rest of the table went with the eggs and sausages as well as the bacon. The meals were quite large and very tasty. My eggs were done well, the sourdough toast was yummy and I enjoyed the purple potatoes in the medley, as for the bacon...well if I wasn't so full I would of ordered another side of it, it was so yummy. In fact, our entire table of 4 enjoyed it immensely. Our cappuccino and lattes were drinkable also, unlike most coffees served in the states ( coffee is not something the States do well). We all agreed, this is a cafe we'd go back too.

The bacon saved it

Lots of hype around this place. I thought it was okay but I wasn't gushing over my meal. Not the best chorizo dish I've had! However... the millionaire bacon made the trip worth it! 

Fantastic experience

We were seated immediately, and we were looked after by the serving staff perfectly. There weren't much waiting time. The menu is varied and large with some great options. I ordered scramled eggs with the "luxury bacon" and it was amazing. The food and the service was impeccable at this place

We often had walked by wondering why the area always smelled like bacon... now we know why there is always a line! The food is great and the portions big enough for two.

Great places, fantastic atmosphere, excellent food. I had the eggs benedict which was perfect and a portion of Millionaires bacon. I had read about it in reviews so had to find it and try it. It certainly didn't disappoint but $8 for two slices was a bit pricey. Still I'd happily go back for breakfast any time.

This was hands down the best breakfast we've ever had and I don't say that lightly. Freshly squeezed orange juice, real maple syrup, unbelievable French toast and pancakes. And the millionaires bacon was easily the best bacon I've ever had.

That's how you start a day!

This restaurant is located near Japantown (or in it, I don't really know where the limits are). People line up early in the morning just to get in, so I already had a good impression of it even before we went in. The service and food were great! The girl that took our orders was super helpful with recommendations. We waited around 15 minutes for our order (we were a party of 14!). The food is so tasty and has this homemade feeling to it! I should warn you that the portions are big! If you're not into eating too much, share a plate. Prices where very reasonable, even cheap at times. Excellent value! Don't think about it, just visit this place and you'll know what I mean.

Holy crap this place was good

We ate a late weekday breakfast and did not have to wait. My family of 5 was seated comfortably, right away. The place was busy and service was a little slow, but we were helped by several servers, who ever was available checked on us. The food was amazing and very large servings. It was expensive, the most we have spent on breakfast, and there were no mimosas or bloody marys on the tab. But I would eat here again and I recommend it for sure. I ate the breakfast tacos - I am almost certain the menu said two tacos, but I was served three. They were so yummy. One son got eggs benedict with mango sausage - he thought it was delicious. Another son had sweet potato pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage. This was a bit more of a "typical" breakfast, but he enjoyed it. My daughter got the strawberry and nutella crepe - it's loaded and covered in whipped cream. Too much for my liking but she plowed through it. My husband got an omelette that had no meat in in - I didn't think it was a good choice and he said it was "ok". He wasn't as enthusiastic about our meal as I was, probably because he paid the bill. But I think if he would have ordered differently, his attitude would be different too. We had to try the millionaires bacon - we shared an order of 2 slices for $8 (!). It was yummy! Don't skip it. If you are in the SF area and want a no fail, delicious breakfast and are willing to pay the above average prices, go here!

You must try it

I visited Sweet Maple as part of my vacation in San Francisco, , I have to say that we visited on a weekday and we arrived about 10 minutes before the opening time and there was a queue already on the door.The experience was fantastic, the attentions and service were unremarkable, as far as the coffee and the food they were certainly superior, we had the fried French toast as part of the menu they were superb.They also have a very interesting variety of omelet combinations that will certainly satisfy the most demanding taste buds. Food is served quickly in considerable portions and very well prepared, the only down side for me was the millionaires bacon, although is freshly made in house is extremely sweet and spicy.Overall the place is a little pricey but certainly is worth visiting and I am sure you will not be disappointed.

This may not be the cheapest spot in town, but you get what you pay for. Absolutely delicious food, friendly service, and spacious eating arrangements. The coffee is fabulous, and I recommend the famous millionaires bacon and the eggs florentine. Perfectly soft poached eggs. And all super fast service! Luckily didn't have to wait in a queue, we obviously arrived at just the right time, half an hour after opening. 

Yummy breakfast

My wife and I weathered the brisk SF morning breeze and around the block line for this spot. A nice touch was free coffee in the waiting line. I had the corn flake French toast & my wife had the deep fried version. Whatever you do, do not miss the Jack Daniels-bacon-coffee ground infused syrup, and millionaire's bacon. It will change you. 

Have to try the millionaires bacon.

We had a hard time picking something from the menu that we didn't want! I had a healthy smoked salmon dish that was incredibly filling and full of fresh produce. My fiance had a delicious scramble. Both of us were barely able to finish the amazing portions which was a shame as everything was absolutely delightful!Would definitely go back again. And again!

'Have heard of Sweet Maple and the storied bacon for years, and knowing it was a highly dangerous mission our party of 8 set out on a Sunday of all days to try and get in. (It appears reservations aren't possible.)We got in line after a long drive from the Easy Bay and even negotiating around a race. Thank heaven for the fresh coffee that they had set up for those who were waiting, a very nice touch! We only waited for about 15-20 min for our table, that's amazing for a large group, and on a Sunday!The different benedict's we ordered were all fantastic, everyone was impressed, and stuffed. And I can now take Millionaire's Bacon off my bucket list. It was absolutely fantastic, rich and filling, completely sensational.For the quality of the food, the service could be awful and people would still come, but it was also just as exceptional. Wonderful, attentive, careful, great service. A great morning!

I went there yesterday per my hair stylist's recommendation. I really liked their Norwegian salad (in the attached photo)!! Matcha latte was a bit sweet for me, but it was good! Service was great! Loved the wait persons' contagious smiles (that made me smile). The restaurant is located very near Japantown, too if anyone here is interested in shopping there afterwards:) I'll go back there for sure.& Maybe next time, I'll have to try their famous Millionaire's Bacon;) Thanks for reading and you have a wonderful day!!

Now this is how you do brunch! Must try the millionaires bacon, its sweet, tender and like no other . A bit pricey for two strips but it's made in-house and the flavor is unmatched. We got the fried french toast Pancakes Marnier French toast All are delish! Plus $20 all you can drink mimosas, how can you beat that? Just note you will only be served unlimited mimosas for a max of 1.5 hours per table, so come ready to draaaannk!

Average at best, I don't get the hype about it!

Went for breakfast one morning and arrived about 7:45am before opening and as expected there was already a queue. As we had read great things about the place we couldn't wait to get in. We were a bit disappointed though to be honest. The food was OK, fairly average for San Francisco really. We ordered 2 eggs any style with Applewood Smoked Bacon and a Blackstone Benedict which came with the famous millionaires bacon. Both came with a potato medley, which was just some different coloured potatoes fried, nothing special. There were also served on cold plates so actually the eggs didn't stay hot for very long at all. The millionaires bacon is very, very sweet, way too much for first thing in the morning but if that's what you like then yeah it's OK. I wouldn't rush back and don't think it's worth the huge queue to get in. Good price though and the portion sizes are big so you won't go away hungry.

Reviews were on point!

This treasure was well worth the 40 min. Wait on Mother's Day Sunday. There were 3 of us and we all ordered something different. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Presentation, taste and portions were all perfect. Service was excellent too. They even had small complementary coffee while waiting. Much appreciated! A must visit when visiting San Fran.
