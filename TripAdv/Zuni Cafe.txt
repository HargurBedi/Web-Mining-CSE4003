Still as good as it gets

Lunch a couple of weeks ago as we went to the City to escape the recent fires. Our house was fine, but the air was too smoky, Zuni has been around so long that all our children remember eating there as toddlers. It was great then and still is. I ordered a gin martini and was very impressed with their decision to make it with Ford's Gin, which I never tasted before. Doubly impressed because it was the best martini I have tasted in years. There is something magical about almost everything they do at Zuni. My companions each had the Caesar, and I got a bite -- still the best Caesar salad ever created. My wife had the salmon which is as I would expect made from a perfect piece of fish,, And by daughter had the polenta, which she liked 30 years ago and still does. I was sorry we were not hungry for dessert, because I am sure the espresso granita' is as delicious as ever.Oddly, I must be the only person who has never much liked the famous chicken. But that's OK because there are always unique dishes to order that you would not find anywhere else. Parking hint: there are almost always spaces across Market on, I think, 11th St. We found a metered spot on the far side of Gough St. a short walk down Rose Alley where the restaurant is. Two-hour meter, enough time for a good lunch.

The food was good but not very special. As starters we had lamb sausage and calamaris which were both average and came rapidly after ordering. The quality of our mains (Salmon and pork chop) was better although the salmon was a bit cold. We loved the Fries and the wine recommendation was also very good. 

The Roast Chicken is Everything!

My husband has been talking about Zuni forever, he loves this, he loves that, etc. But, he never explained to me how truly wonderful the food is. My husband and I went with his aunt and uncle who are SF locals. The men had oysters and we split the Caesar salad and another salad that was delicious. When it came time for the roast chicken, I honestly thought I would pick at it (like I do most of my food) but I gobbled it up! The atmosphere was very hip and cool, the restaurant was packed, but I still felt like I was having an intimate meal with family. We had a table upstairs that looked over the bar and the street, it was a fantastic view! Honestly, I am running back to SF, just for Zuni!

Relaxed Return to a 30-Year-Old Memory

We last ate at Zuni Cafe 30 years ago, and were delighted to find the restaurant still open at the same place and with the same extraordinary quality of seafood. It's a relaxed but busy venue, full of big windows open to the street outside. Inside, on a coolish night, the smell of a wood-fired oven not far from our table made it feel campfire-comfortable as we settled into our chairs, drank wine and craft beer and awaited -- very pricey -- oysters from up and down the West Coast. But they were worth the splurge and the rekindling of memory from that long-ago visit, when we were just visiting and didn't live, as we do now, on the West Coast. The food is great, I need say no more, and the atmosphere romantic. Zuni lived up to all we remembered it was, and still is.

Go for the Wood-fired Roast Chicken !

We remember a great night out at Zuni Cafe 29 years ago ! Finding ourselves back in San Francisco for a few days, just had to go back for memories sake. I would not normally order chicken of any sort in a restaurant to be honest...tend to choose things that I do not cook at home - however, after reading numerous reports of the amazing Wood-fired Roast chicken, couldn't not order it !It costs $58 for 2 people, and it takes an hour....but it really is worth it ! The best Roast chicken I have had ! There is more than enough for two, plus take home ! The plate is piled with the broken down chicken, mixed with little pieces of bread/stuffing - and topped with mustard greens. Most people seemed to be ordering the Caesars Salad as a shared starter, so just followed suit with that choice too ! It did seem that a majority of the restaurant were ordering the chicken and caesars salad, but based on how good these were, and the fact the restaurant has been successful for so long - I'm sure all choices are good ! Hopefully we will be back sooner next time !

We stumbled across this restaurant walking through the area. The staff and menu selections were fantastic. It was a really hot day and we wanted to stop for a drink. We ended up having lunch and drinking. The staff were so great, they didn't rush us out and allowed us to enjoy a leisurely lunch. Food options were extensive and the oysters were wonderfully fresh. Thank you to the staff!

Polenta problem

We went just before the theater for an early dinner. One of us ordered polenta. We noticed that the couple to our right side had also ordered it and apparently did not find to be good. So, we waited for ours to come. After some waiting, the waitress came and told us that it will take another 15 minutes for the polenta to be ready because it had to be redone. Since we did not have time we said, no and ordered something which could be ready quicker. When the bill came, we were surprise when the waitress said, they had not charged us for the polenta (which we never saw!)....

Be prepared to spend some time here, especially if you plan to have the wood-fired chicken. It seriously takes an hour. BUT, it is definitely worth the wait! We filled the time with Caesar salad and an heirloom tomato salad (and the wine helped), but I can't tell you enough how fabulous the chicken was. It's roasted on a bed of delicious bread stuffing with greens on top. One chicken is recommended for 2 people, but you should definitely have left overs. The bread is wonderful as well, plus great service rounded out a wonderful dinner.

A friend and I met to catch up and eat before seeing a musical. We had a reservation and were the first people in once the door opened. By the time we left, it appeared that every table we could see was filled, so I think a reservation is a good idea.The meal--waiter was helpful but not overbearing. High points were his willingness to get me a taste of wine not on the wine list, which is the wine I chose over the ones on the list. He also gave menu suggestions which we took and enjoyed. The food was lovely, a bit of comfort food and a bit nouvelle cuisine. All in all, we had a great lunch, we had money in our pocket when we left, we could have a good conversation (sitting upstairs was not too noisy), and we were not rushed out so they could turn the table. A very satisfactory lunch, indeed.

Cocktails were excellent. Caesar had amazing croutons and good dressing. The most amazing dish was the chicken for two and the shoestring potatoes. Not sure if we waited a whole hour, because the cocktails were flowing, but definitely worth the wait. The portion was huge and the "bread salad," which we discovered underneath about 1/4 of the way in was like nothing we've ever had before. Scrumptious. BTW, we didn't have a reservation, but were immediately seated at a table at the bar. (9 pm on a Wednesday)

Whenever we travel to San Francisco, will always make a point to visit this flavorful institution, but somehow it dropped off our radius the last 3-5 years or so.But a recent visit kind of bring back the exact memories we have had on this cafe , despite our knowledge that the founder may have passed on, but the Roast Chicken remains Golden Brown on bed of bread slices and green leaves, so gorgeous to just look at it , never change since we first visited them almost 15 years ago, more importantly the tenderness of meat, moist and spice aroma just gotten better, still worth the trip to visit Zuni and enjoy this signature succulent dish.

The Zuni cafe has been a San Francisco stand by for quite a long time -- and deservedly so. The food is really good -- and they've migrated to Mediterranean from southwest. The service is professional and friendly. And the space is unusual and interesting. The ventilation could use an upgrade, however.This was my first time there and iI horoughly enjoyed it. While there are many trendier restaurants, there aren't many that are better.

We'd heard so much about the Zuni Cafe, we just had to try it. The food was really good - very fresh - and our waitress was over the top friendly. It's certainly unique in menu offerings, decor, and vibe. But it wasn't our favorite spot to dine in the San Francisco area. Some of the people there (snippets of conversation are hard not to hear when the tables are so close together) were a bit - how shall I phrase this - full of themselves? And, of course, parking is an issue. But aside from that, my pasta primavera was delicious :-)

As usual, we had a great meal at Zuni's last Sunday with friends. Oysters, seafood, sparkling wine and friends. Oysters are always fresh and the seafood is prepared just right. It can get busy and crowded at night, reservations are definitely required and sometimes, some of the waitstaff can get a bit cranky when crowded, but what would you expect in a crowded small room?

Farm-to-table seafood to greens; everything at Zuni was shared, savored, and talked about! Halibut or roast chicken? Both!! Long list of wines, cognacs and brandies. Gnocchi, cured anchovies, Monterey Bay squid, olives, cheese and rustic bread, were all loved! The entrees were served promptly. The amazing roast chicken won the evening! The Caesar salad with the most robust croutons known to man or woman, was wonderful. Dessert? Many locally-sourced goodies!! Get the chocolate Gateau!!

Went here for lunch the other day with pretty high expectations and I would say that we weren't disappointed. Top 100 restaurant in the country? Not sure about that, but very good nonetheless. We had the Caesar salad to start which was really good and pretty good size as well. Probably not the best I have ever had, which I had read it would be, but very good. We also shared the Scallops, Burger, Roasted Chicken and French fries. I would say the chicken lived up to the hype, and the burger and scallops were good, but not great. I had read this was one of the best burgers in S.F., which I now hope is not the case. Not to say it wasn't good, but there are surely better. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, ambiance and area that Zuni was in and would recommend.

Please refer to all other reviews to the chicken as well, but here is mine. We went for a special Boozy girls lunch and we had reservations on a Wednesday at 12:15, it was kind of quite which was really nice, we were seated immediately and sat in the area that overlooks the kitchen. They bring bread immediately to the table which looked great but I held off for the chicken. We ordered our drinks and then a salad to split as well as put in our order of chicken immediately. Our waiter was super fast and very friendly. The chicken does take about 60 minutes, but either call ahead or just wait for it already, it is so worth it! The service is impeccable and so on top of things. So after munching on the potato string fries and the salad we were finally ready for some chicken. It says chicken for two, but we were three and still took some home. Make sure to eat some of the bread and currents underneath the chicken, that is what makes it really special. So anyways, please go check out this iconic restaurant and GET THE CHICKEN, you will be so happy you did!

We don't get to this part of Market street very much, but we drunkenly stumbled in for a late-night dinner and it was delicious. The staff was a little snooty (hence the 4 stars), but then again we might have been slightly annoying (hence the solid 4 stars). I don't eat meat, but my friend force fed me a bite of burger and YUM. Definitely made me wish I hadn't given up meat (and I NEVER miss it)! Yum.

Despite living in San Francisco for a number of years, we hadn't made it to Zuni Cafe. But when we finally did, we realized that the restaurant deserves all of the hype and is a true city institution for a reason. We were skeptical about the roast chicken at first -- but it's definitely worth the cost and the wait. Order it as soon as you sit down, and then decide your appetizers and wine afterwards which you can then enjoy as you wait for your chicken to be prepared. Our server, Jeff, was also excellent. He was just the right amount of attentive and his recommendations (for wine, apps, oysters, and dessert) were spot on. We really thought he was one of the best servers we've had. The food itself was delicious, but the great service made the meal truly memorable. We started our meal with fresh oysters (3 different kinds, although they had a menu of around 20+ kinds). Their menu is seasonal and rotates often. We had the grapefruit and avocado salad which was in season and a refreshing burst of flavor. We also tried the asparagus risotto with the first of the season asparagus, which was creamy and savory. And then arrived the chicken. Flavorful, juicy and delicious, every bite was a treat. But oh, that bread salad --it's what dreams of made of! Finished with a lovely champagne vinaigrette, dried currants and pine nuts, I've craved that bread pudding so much I've since looked up the recipe and made it at home. And the best part? There's enough of the chicken to take it home for another meal. Definitely plenty for 4 people to share. We finished the meal off with a lovely Meyer lemon tart that was demolished far too quickly. We'll be back for sure -- both for the amazing food, and the great service!

We went for dinner on a pretty busy Friday night. Our table wasn't ready, but we were happy to get a cocktail at the bar. I was less happy that my martini spilled on the wobbly table when we were eventually shown to it, but it's the measure of the place that they quickly moved us to an adjacent solid table, cleared up without fuss and quietly comped the drink when it came to paying the bill. (I should stress I didn't ask for or expect this!)We shared the oven roasted chicken which was very tasty. I am not sure it was worth the amount charged, but to put it in perspective it wasn't any more expensive than most places charge for a couple of entrees.To the lint: I couldn't work out where all the white stuff was coming from until I realised the napkin was moulting. I mentioned this to a passing waitress who laughed and told me they knew, everyone complained, and they had a big lint roller at the front desk.For a restaurant of this supposed class, it's an irritant. New napkins or a decent laundry are called for!

The chicken at Zuni is truly the best single meal we have ever had in the city. It serves two people. I am not even sure why they have a menu.

My wife and I had dinner here on our second night in San Francisco. Several of my wife's friends recommended the place. I hadn't made reservations in advance for this part of the trip and everything, including Zuni's was booked. But, Zuni's said if we got there early, put our name in and sat at the bar for a while, we could probably grab a seat in the so called walk in area next to the bar. We did.Service at the bar and the table was excellent. Great wine list, both by the bottle and glass. Ate fries or friets at the bar, tasty. My wife and I decided to go for the roasted chicken for two for dinner. The dinner choices are limited and mostly fish. My wife only liked the chicken, so that is what we ordered. And what a chicken it was. The best ever anywhere. A whole cut up roasted chicken is on top of an herbal bread thing that was crispy on the top and moist on the bottom, all topped with tasty mustard geens. Very tasty dessert.The outing was not cheap, but certainly not expensive. Great bang for the buck. Great place for value diners with money in thier pocket.

We love this spot. We have been many times and we always order the chicken. The chicken takes an hour to cook so order as soon as you sit down. It was served on top of a bread stuffing that was drenched chicken drippings. On top of all of this were mustard greens. The blend of the flavors were delicious. There were six of us and the waiter should have told us we ordered too much food even though we asked him. If you are six order two Ceasars and two chickens. Instead we got three which was way too much food.

Zuni has been a San Francisco landmark since 1979. we went to dinner on a Sunday evening after arriving from London. The restaurant was busy. brief wait and excellent Martini at the bar. Our Waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. we had some Belon oysters from Lopez Island Washington followed by a delicious butter nut squash soup with lemon zest and poppy seeds and an Arugula salad with Manchego and almonds. Then we both had the famous chicken roasted in the wood burning oven mouth wateringly delicious. The manager was tasting various wines with the next table and we got talking. One of tasters was John Herbstritt the wine director of Mr Jiu's but more of that in another review. He recommended the Zuni Pinot Noir from Santa Rita Hills. A perfect accompaniment to the flavoursome bird.

We heard about this place before we arrived at SF and wanted to try it. We were having a drink at another bar and a local told us that we must try this place so we tried very hard to get a reservation and was finally able to get in before we left town. The food was solid. We did not want to wait for their famous chicken so we settled for seafood. We had salmon and trout and they were excellent. The food presentation was excellent as well. We thought the portion was on the smaller side and we have average appetite but I suppose this is SF after all so everything is a bit pricey. There are, however, couple things that the restaurant should work on: 1)the noise level was out of this world and I was trying to read my husband's lips all night. If you want a romantic dinner and be able to carry on some deep conversation during the meal, it would be hard to do at this place;2)the bathroom was messy and I firmly believe a bathroom speaks volume about a place. It is a big restaurant with very high volume so it needs to be cleaned throughout the peak dinner period and not just at end of the shift.

This is a wonderful standby with consistently good food. The staff works seamlessly together, and they work the best they can to accommodate. We went on a day when their grill was inoperative, so we had to look to things we don't normally order. That turned out to be a good exercise in variation. The four of us finished our meals, so it must've been good! The Classic Bloody Mary is rich and fresh and bright. I forget sometimes that many people like a lot of dressing. My Caesar Salad had too much dressing; ask for it light or on the side, or both. And this is weird, but they offer no "Chicken Ceasar", huh. The French Toast was luscious, and merited the label of "foodie-worthy". The egg dishes were of equal quality and are now on our list of try-again choices. There is one glitch, if you want the Roast Whole Chicken, you have to order it as soon as you sit down. The menu says it can take up to an hour to deliver to your table, and you can't order it as you wait for your table, and certainly not by phone on your way there. I think they should do so, even if you have to guarantee it by a credit card. It would help them sell more chickens, and turn over their tables more quickly. Just a thought.

Loved sitting close to the heat as it was a cool night.The Orange Blossom cocktail was light and refreshing. The three of us shared the piccolo fritto appetizer: olives, onion slices and cauliflower fried lightly in a delicate batter. Yum!The Tunisian chick pea stew was fantastic as a starter. Subtle spicy broth and impossible to guess what spice blend made it so special. I would eat this every rainy day if I could!

The location, decor, menu, and service all contribute to a lovely dining experience. It is not far from the "F" muni line for those who want to take public transportstion. They also have a lovely selection of oysters and clams for those who just want to have a little aperitvio before dinner!

Zuni cafe has been around for about 18 years and when it first opened it created quite a stir in the fairly saturated fine dining market of San Francisco. Traditional and modern American cuisine using locally sourced good produce and simple techniques have been the hallmarks of this very fine cafe. Almost two decades later it still lives up to its original hype and reputation. The food is great, the service really excellent, with attentive and informed staff, and a frequently changing menu with something to satisfy everyone, from red meat eating carnivores to vegetarians. There is a good wine selection, and a fine range of cocktails. It is well worth a visit and a good meal is always a guarantee!

A large party was already seated and it was a bit loud but still a comfortable experience. Our waitress was friendly and immediately asked if anyone wanted the classic roasted chicken as it takes nearly an hour and she wanted to put in the order right away. My husband and I were first time visitors and decided it would be fun to try. Our companions chose to order other options, but the waitress timed it so we all had our entrees together. We both order appetizers to split. We had an arugula salad which was tasty but definitely a very small portion. Our friends ordered clams and although the presentation was lovely, there was very little actual food on the plate. The same was true when their entrees arrived. The portions seemed quite meager. Our chicken was $58 and was a whole chicken that came with a bread salad. It was absolutely delicious and there was enough that we could share some with our friends as they both were still hungry after finishing their meals. The service was efficient if a little impersonal. I think the quality of the food is very high, but this would not be a good spot if you have big eaters in your party. I would not dream of taking my 22 year old son here - he would have to have a second meal to even approach being full.

Only had the chicken and a few cocktails. Suppose it's a bit pricey for a whole chicken but is well worth it. All you need for 2 people - we were both full. Spend the rest of your money on cocktails as they're amazing!

We are on a gastronomic tour of California, and this is number two on our favourite list, just behind Lucques in LA. First of all, the oyster list is the best we have ever experienced, anywhere on the planet. We ended up having 16, in four batches of four, and they were all excellent. We opted for one starter, the fettuccine, and one entree, the belly of pork, as our mains. Both were excellent. The real surprise was the cheese course, where we had an extraordinarily creamy goats cheese, with walnuts and pomegranate seeds, and a blue cheese with honey. They were both the most imaginative cheese courses we had tasted for many years. Dessert was the most exquisite panna cotta, with huckleberries and crushed graham crackers. We had a white and a red wine, both by Au Bon Climat, which were reasonably priced. Service was excellent, from our knowledgable and enthusiastic waiter.This was a hugely enjoyable Sunday supper.

we went with friends from SF that come a lot. Very nice beginning of the evening as this is a well run operation that is quite large. The caesar salad is huge and good for sharing. The other green salad was so-so. Pasta was good, but the main dish that came with spinach was so salty it had to be sent back. The clam chowder was interesting with real clams and shells, but ultimately too slaty as well. The cookies and other desserts very good. Wine not unreasonable, but hardly inexpensive.

Had clam chowder and the roast pork. Best thing about the meal was the bread. In particular the main(pork) was cold. They gladly replaced it but the replacement version looked like it had been slapped on the plate and not very nice. I could have cooked it better myself and I am not a cook. Wine list was good and the atmosphere was good.

We had such a wonderful time at Zuni Cafe for Sunday lunch. We started with both types of bloody mary, the classic and the balsamic, and the orange cocktail. The classic was spicy and delicious as a virgin; the balsamic was perfectly sweet with vodka. We shared three types of oysters and even the first-time-oyster-eater at the table enjoyed hers! We got the chicken and the caesar salad (at the risk of being basic) and both were sublime. We ate every bite. Our server was attentive, helpful, and very interesting. He gave great guidance on wine and also heartfelt thoughts on the SF political climate. He made our meal even more special by sharing his Cuban-Italian background and thoughts on the future. We had such a wonderful time that we bought the cookbook to remember it by. It is well-written and detailed. I can't wait to go back to Zuni, and in the meantime, I'll try my hand at making the caesar salad at home.

Dinner last Saturday night exceeded expectations. Service by Kevin was great, timing of serving appetizers, drinks, entrees and dessert was perfect. The appetizers(fries, anchovies) were very tasty and recommended. Our party of two couples each ordered the famous chicken and it was juicy and very flavorful. The bread salad underneath the chicken was also very flavorful from the chicken juice. Our wine was priced fairly. The desserts(chocolate cake and another) were okay but not extraordinary. We were seated upstairs in a small alcove which was nice as it was a quiet area with 4-5 other tables. Ask to be seated there as it works well if you want a quiet area to be able to hold a conversation with your group.

Zuni is certainly a SF institution and a fun place to eat and people watch. Had a nice visit although slightly disappointed in the quality of the food compared to visits past. Caesar salad was fresh and tasty though not a show stopper. Roasted chicken tostada was delicious, still trying to interpret the wonderful mix of flavors and herbs. Roasted chicken is their classic, was certainly moist and flavorful and the bread salad is always to die for but something was just a little less magnificent than it has been before. Service is on point and cocktails hot the spot so hopefully they can get that little bit of groove back to really set them apart in a city of many delicious competitors.

We had a truly memorable meal on our last night in San Francisco on the recommendation of a friend who used to live there. I'm told they are famous for their chicken, fries and Caesar salad. I believe these dishes are the fixtures and the rest changes daily to some extent. Of those three we only had the chicken but that was fantastic. It takes an hour to prepare so we began with a couple of starters of which my favourite was the piccolo frito. Our waiter was very helpful with recommendations and made sure the food came at appropriate intervals. It was definitely the best service we had in three weeks in the US. The chicken was the highlight. Really very tasty and moist and cooked with pine nuts, raisins and served on sourdough. It's a whole bird for two people and we took leftovers with us for a sandwich the next day. I also took away several pages of recipe for it too so I can try to replicate it. Also worth saying it's a lovely building which helps create a nice atmosphere. On a corner with lots of glass and wood and nicely lit. We chatted to fellow diners and had a very good time.

We don't drive often to San Francisco on the weekends but when we do, this is one of the place we often attempt to eat at! I say "attempt" because the line is usually up to 2h of wait, so plan ahead and book your reservation! The cocktails at the copper bar is a great beginning, the polenta with mascarpone is quite creamy and it's more of a cream/soup than what I expected but very delicious.The chicken is worth the wait - 1h usually until it's ready... if you want to save a bit of time, you can tell them at checkin that you'll be having the chicken and they place the order right away. Our dinner for 2 is usually about $200 but trust me, so worth it!

Could be resting on its name at this point, our food was good, tasty and simple but with each dish, I can say that I've had better elsewhere. Service was nice if a little cool. Pizza was tasty but so thin it could have been a cracker.

I liked the space, hip, comfortable, good level of background noise, but conversation was easy to hear. Excellent service, even with a busy night and full tables. What really surprised was the food. My entree would appear to have been hanging around for some time with most of it being cold, the roasted vegetables were more dehydrated than caramelized and the meat was uninspiringly cooked and presented. Wine was good if rather overpriced. Lastly, it looked like whoever plated the meal was short of time and threw it on the plate.All in all, I was a bit shocked, and assume they were having a bad day. But for the price of the meal, I won't be back soon.Ian

A Wonderful Meal WITHOUT the 1 hour chicken

The local restaurant reviewers prefer something new and shiny and trendy, over something that's old hat and reliable. Understandable, but we're tourists, so Zuni might be old to hat to the locals, but it was new to us. Which means, we could get a reservation 2 days in advance instead of a month in advance. Lucky for us. Now, the one-hour chicken waiting game is ridiculous. Why waste an otherwise lovely evening. So we skipped the chicken dance. We had a wonderful meal anyway. We had some wonderful seafood dishes. And the house Caesar salad is undoubtedly the best version of a Caesar salad we have ever eaten. Wonderful hot bread. Dessert was also delicious. We would not be reluctant to go back for a reliably good meal.

Birthday Lunch

I had not been to Zuni Cafe for a couple of years and wanted to get back to try them on a weekend for lunch. My birthday gave us an opportunity to revisit this icon restaurant. We made reservations a month in advance and had tickets for a concert in the evening after the lunch. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately, on the second level, Market Street side by the window. This would have been my selection if I had the choice, so I did not have to ask. Bright sunshine and good ventilation.We started with a dozen mixed oysters and a bottle of Dom Perignon. I must say, that the oysters were perfectly arranged in an elevated tray with delicate sauce choices. They were very fresh and a delight on the palate. Paired with the champagne, the oysters went down so well, we ordered a few more of our favorites.We followed the appetizer with the Roasted Chicken, which is Zuni's signature dish. It exceeded our expectations. Perfectly cooked with a beautiful presentation. I especially love the cornbread stuffing and the moist delicate seasonings.I am not a big dessert person, so I had a nice Madeira and my companion had a 10 year Tawny Port and we both had coffee.It was an outstanding experience overall with the excellent service by the whole staff.I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and visitors to the city.

We went along with high expectations on a Sunday evening. However, my excitement dissolved when greeted by the waitress serving the outside tables who had a dreadful attitude. We were then shown to our table (worst one in the restaurant), as I had already predicted to my partner. What we had actually done to upset the staff so much I do not know! We had been looking forward to the house special but ended up having just two lighter courses. The food we had was good but we were just let down by service (I should say that our actual waiter was very good, he was just let down by others). We had booked weeks in advance and had high expectations of Zuni. It was the most disappointing restaurant experience during our two vacation in California. The service at both Absinthe and Rich Table was excellent and far better value.

My niece has raved about this restaurant for years and it's always a required stop, when she visits the area. When planning a trip to the San Francisco area, this was immediately added to the itinerary. The food, starting with salad and the main course of Chicken and bread salad, were fantastic. Unfortunately, the attitude of the host, server and manager were shameful. We had made a reservation weeks in advance for our party of 6 but were treated as if our being there was in inconvenience. Our server had to be asked repeatedly for water and bread refills, forgot several side dishes and overall had a horrific attitude. When we began our meal it was explained we would need two checks (not an unreasonable request for six adults). After the meal it was explained, by the manager, that this could not be done as it would take a server over 10 minutes and there wasn't time. Apparently simple math / using a calculator is a skill not possessed by servers / management. The manager returned to the table, while were passing cash and cards back and forth, and made a snide comment about "he should hire us for our math skills" or some such nonsense. When paying over $400 for drinks and dinner I have never experienced service as bad as during this meal or have a manager with such a lack of for communication skills. When making a return trip to the area, we will skip this restaurant and choose one of the many others with equally or better ratings. We have their cook book and can make the chicken at home for much less money and attitude!

I took some customers there for fine dining, based on the recommendations of the concierge, the airline I used to come SFO (they had a virtual tour of SFO on board) and some friends.Well, 400+$ later, I left hungry, disappointed and seriously wondering what the fuss was all about.The place is loud, busy, noisy and swarming with action in all directions.The food was limited (normally, a limited choice menu means great control of your quality).The menu was covering a Americanized Italian flavoring, without nailing the basics.(Gnoccis have never, ever looked like that, at least not in Italy!).So, it must be hype for some and lots of DotCom people were definitely hanging out with passion at the bar, but I would say...nah! with the same money, there is for sure much better somewhere else.Very average. a shame as I had high expectations (maybe that's why)

Supposed to be a great restaurant. During our visit, it was extremely average. My daughter and her friend had the brick chicken - a specialty. Made to order? Hmmmm... Should have been hotter and more tender if that was the case. I had some pork special. It was served very rare with a thin, water gravy? We had an assortment of appetizers, sides and salads that are less than memorable. Our server was terrible. She did not check back, did not ask about our meals, and brought all our items in a rather odd order. $317 later (not including the 3 drinks I had to go to the bar to order and purchase) we were wishing we had made different dinning plans. My daughter lives about 2 blocks from Zuni, and my favorite B&B is just up the street. Not sure if we will try this again.....

The roast chicken was of course stellar but, 60$ for it, really? The restaurant has wonderful ambiance but, the prices on the menu hold you back from enjoying that. If the roast chicken included a couple of sides for the price - that would be wonderful and I would not hesitate in recommending this place to anyone. You pick a few sides from the menu and it seems they are aiming straight for your wallet. Their fries look so tempting but at SF prices it makes you shake your head in disbelief.For dessert we had panna cotta and for the price there was no fruit coulis - just plain (but creamy and just the right amount of sweet) which we decided to share.A return trip is guaranteed if the restaurant (they have lost their founder - for whose culinary talent there were many accolades) gets its act together and makes 'value' their driving force and not greed.

Had a great meal at Zuni. Service was excellent and had the amazing 'Zuni' pinot everyone raves about, definitely try it. The food was great, had the peppers for starter and then shared the ricotta gnocchi which was pretty good, and for main we shared the pork dish, which fell a bit flat in my opinion. thrity-something dollars for a sausage and some burnt ends is a bit much for something you could make at home for less than 5 bucks. We didn't go with the chicken everyone raves about, but seriously $66 for a chicken? Wow... I'm looking forward to trying that one. Overall, really loved it but just felt a little let down overall, perhaps I shouldn't have read into all the 'hype' and just appreciated it for what it was - good, honest, home-style food cooked perfectly.

For eleven years now we have been visiting Zuni Cafe for their amazing food and service. Tonight's visit however was simply one major issue after another. We had five diners and immediately explained that we needed a split check - two adults on one and three on another. We ordered wine (I adore the ZUNI Pinot) which was lovely. We had salads (the Caesar is always excellent), polenta, and Chicken with warm bread salad (one of the best dishes I've ever had). The issues did not lie with the food. Our waiter wouldn't bring bread when requested. He wouldn't bring butter when requested (twice). He forgot to enter the side dish that one person at the table ordered, and thusly it arrived far later than the rest of our meals. We didn't complain to management (as everyone has bad days now and then); however, at the end of the evening he brought us single check. I returned it to him and asked it to be split as requested at the start. He said that they cannot split checks (first, we have had checks split for 11 years now, and secondly, if it couldn't be split, shouldn't you have mentioned that at the start?). He brought us a male manager who explained that it "takes ten or fifteen minutes to split a check". That seems somewhat ridiculous, but we said that's fine. He then went on to ask if we could split it on our own as check splitting takes time from other diners (it's 10:15pm on a Sunday night, so it was us and one other table, so that seemed somewhat odd). However, we said that we would split it. We did the addition on the paper tablecloth; the manager came back and said "perhaps we should hire you to split bills for us as you're good at it!" Sir, don't be snide- a 9 year old should be able to do this basic addition that apparently takes your staff ten to fifteen minutes. Anyway, at the end we had $230 to cover the $223 bill. Two adults double counted this cash, while three others watched. All five adults noted the $230 left on the table. We gather our things and walk out; the manager then comes out, stating that we didn't leave enough to cover the bill. He tosses the black bill folder back at me and we count it - suddenly, we only have $210 in the check. Somehow, magically!, $20 seemed to have disappeared (meaning that either the server pocketed it when realizing that we left him very little tip, or the manager pocketed it). I give him a $20 to cover it; the manger says "you didn't leave him a tip!" Again sir, with the service we received tonight, absolutely no tip was deserved or earned, and at this point I really wish that I would have counted the cash in front of you before leaving the building so that you couldn't squeeze another solitary cent from me. What a poor example of a waiter, and what a horrendous manager. This certainly makes me hesitant to take guests to Zuni Cafe in the future, which is so heartbreaking as its one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

I have heard about their chicken but have not ordered it until last Sunday when I finally took my wife with me to have dinner. I usually eat here alone for lunch when I'm craving a hamburger. We got there at 5:00 and it does take an hour to prepare the chicken so order it when you sit down if you go early in the evening.Started off with a well made martini. Since we knew we were going to be there a bit I ordered some Pacific Hog Island oysters. They were very fresh.We then shared an order of their white minestrone soup (which they served in separate bowls) and followed that with a salad topped with grilled oranges. No complaints on any of these two dishes.Our heaping plate of chicken then arrived with a warm bread salad underneath. It was soooo good. My biggest hint would be to save the pieces you want to attack using your hands for home!Too full for dessert. The service was excellent too.

The service and food are always on point. I've been here at least 10 times, they've never missed. I saw one of the negative reviewers saying that the menu is limited and only has like 8 things on it. Um, that's kind of the point. Best chicken, best caesar salad on the planet. Oysters are always top quality. Go in order a dozen Kumimoto oysters, the caesar, and the chicken and be done with it. I have to question anyone's credibility and food/restaurant knowledge who gives this place a negative review.

During a visit to SF in August 2016, friends who lived in that City invited us to Zuni Cafe. Apparently, reservations are hard to come by, but our friends arranged. We all got the house specialty (chicken roasted in brick oven) and Caesar salads. Everyone satisfied! Prices are a bit high, but this is SF, and the restaurant is somewhat "exclusive" (though casual). We enjoyed our meal. Service was quite good.

This place was so amazing! It's a rustic-decor restaurant on Market St in downtown SF with a wood-burning oven and a gourmet take on clean, simple, amazing food. Our server was attentive and prompt, the food was delicious, the wine list was perfection. With its brick-and-rough-hewn-wood architecture, it manages to be cozy and upscale at the same time. Highly recommend it if you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for an off-the-beaten-track, amazing dining experience. Just make sure you make a reservation (even if you're planning to go for lunch) because the tables fill up quickly.

Yes, everyone comes for the chicken and that is great. But maybe this restaurant needs to spend some time on a few other matters that diners also consider important in a restaurant. The staff need a bit of waking up. Service on a Sunday was forgetful and slow. Also the habit of clearing tables before all diners have finished their food is an approach to waiting tables that I am not used to. The manner in which it was done was also more McDonald's than bijou San Fran eatery. And lastly what's with the mice. At the end of our meal a fellow diner shrieked as there was a mouse in the restaurant. The waitress was unperturbed explaining this occurrence as typical in San Fran due to the old buildings. We have old buildings in London, mice running around restaurants is not a common experience when dining.
