I was looking forward to my first experience at a Vietnamese restaurant. The evening started with a lackluster greeting from Kelly, no eye contact, no smile. That's usually a sign of what will come after. We ordered drinks and an assortment of plates. Throughout the service there were 5 different people bringing food to the table. Only 1 young blonde girl actually asked us how we were doing. Everybody else, just put a plate on the table and left. There was no rapport established between server and customer.The food portions are very small for the price you are paying. The food was good but it didn't matter because that old saying kicked in: it's not what you say, it's not what you did, it's how you made people feel. Disappointing evening. The view of the Bay Bridge was fabulous.

To be fair to a The Slanted Door owners, they are probably paying a fortune for rent in a city where everything, from trolley car rides to parking is tremendously overpriced. And the food was very good. But after I enjoyed it and the view I'm left wondering what about it made it double in price what I could get at dozens of other restaurants for much less. The answer? I'm paying their San Francisco rent. In addition it got incredibly noisy as the place filled and I kind of got the impression that they were trying to turn our table after only about 40 minutes. If you can accept that a trip to SF is going to cost you more for everything, it's a good meal.

The dining is bright, spacious and provides beautiful view of the Bay Bridge, this place is packed on a Sunday Brunch. Without reservation, we're lucky to have a table for 4. Starting with Jicama& Grapefruit salad. It was a refreshing salad. Red cabbages dominated jicama and grapefruit. Tasty Lamb sirloin and Brentwood farms sweet corn. Spicy Monterey Squid was not bad. It appears they're using broken rice for jasmine rice.

We ferried to San Francisco to meet for dinner at the Slanted Door in the Ferry Terminal. I think this should be a requirement to get you into the right mood for the dinner. I also suggest you take the Ferry just before dusk. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was good. The only thing I might note is that the level of the background noise was so high you could not carry on a normal conversation without shouting.

The Slanted Door in San Francisco:Just rolled out the door after a delicious dinner. The Imperial Rolls were on just about every table- deservedly since a highlight. Pork belly appetizer also flavorful and different ( half portions not listed but available for some dishes )Signature shaking beef filet mignon not to be missed. Cellophane noodles with crab a little bland for our taste but loaded with big chunks of fresh Dungeness crab. Corn dish was good but not as good as rest. Dessert churro were very light and not very sweet. Noise level prevented conversation and they were absolutely packed even on a Tuesday. Ask for a table facing the bridge - the lights are spectacular.

We found the restaurant on tripadvisor and went the first night of our 3 night stay. The food and atmosphere were so good we ate there again on our last night. It is very popular and we had to eat at the bar the first night. So glad we did as the bar staff were very interactive especially Moises, Kent and Daniel. We actually asked to eat at he bar the second time we went.The food is fusion and very interesting. It's lovely to be able to try lots of small plates. We had different food both times and it was all excellent. It may seem expensive but it's value for money.Will certainly go back again.

This restaurant is one I visit every time I'm in San Francisco. The first time I visited it back in the 90's, it was a little quaint place in the Mission District. It moved sometime ago to the Ferry Building and is now an expansive modern setting with lovely views both inside and outside. You have views of the bay and Oakland Bridge out the expansive windows and Ferry Building harbor and the open concept interior with family style tables affords great people watching. I love to sit at the counter (get there early as they fill up fast every night) and watch the bartender libation and fresh oyster preparation (shucking and shaving of ice). Every cocktail and dish is not only deliciously conceived with rich flavor, but is also artfully presented. Service is fast and efficient, and all the staff seems to really enjoy working there. Food portions are ample. If you are a solo diner, the kitchen will half many of the menu items for you. I have never had a dish I didn't relish, and I've never had a bad service experience at Slanted Door. If you have the opportunity when in SFO, dine at Slanted Door and be amazed!

We read so many nice reviews about this restaurant and we were not disappointed. Great panoramic views, fantastic food and lovely staff. The atmosphere was great. We highly recommend trying crispy imperial rolls and caramelised pork belly. Those dishes were full of flavour. It was the best pork belly dish I have ever eaten. Besides it's softness, the ginger and poached egg added to it deliciousness. By the way, half portions are allowed, also half glasses of wine. Bear in mind, even appetizer portions were quite large, we shared 2.5 appetisers and one main dish with small rice. It was too much and we took some away and handed in to one homeless person on the street.

Walked in to have a drink and was immediately greeted with a rude "the host stand is over here" (literally 2 feet from where we were standing and in easy view).

Go elsewhere if you actually wanted to be treated like a guest.

My girlfriends went to Slanted Door for a late Friday afternoon lunch. We made a reservation and when we arrive, the hostess walked us to a table in the back of the hotel. We asked if we could have one of the open booths facing the Bay but she declined. She mentioned that we had to make a personal request for a table in the front part of the restaurant. Overall the food was delicious but we were surprised and a bit stunned to find a live, squirming slug in our salad. We tossed it onto the table and asked for our waitress. She came by and acted as if it was an everyday occurrence -- no big deal and didn't offer to remove it from our table, replace the plate, nor did she apologize. The manager came by and we had to ask him to please remove the slug from our table. The net-net -- the lettuce was probably purchased in bulk -- either it wasn't washed at all or it was not washed thoroughly. There are so many other amazing restaurants in the City and while these things can happen, the way it was handled, was unimpressive.

I wasn't impressed by Slanted Door, perhaps because I live in an area with top-notch, authentic (and much cheaper) Vietnamese food. The food (e.g., ribs and chicken) felt gloppy and over-sauced, a touch Americanized. The service wasn't responsive. The atmosphere was dated, like a 1980s time warp. I just wasn't feeling the place.

Being in the Ferry Building, traffic in the area is very busy and crowded. Plan on parking a couple blocks away and walking. We were seated in the large dining room where there are a lot of tables packed together like a school cafeteria. The first item we ordered were the Slanted Door Spring rolls. They were completely devoid of flavor. They were absolutely dry and bland. The next time was the Grapefruit, jicama and red cabbage salad. This salad was full of flavor but the portion served was very small. We then had the caramelized wild gulf shrimp. The shrimp were small sized and they all had tails on. This dish was also very bland and boring. It could be the same dish from any other Chinese restaurant across the country. The seared dayboat scallops was very good. The scallops were perfectly cooked, juicy on the inside and married perfectly with the coconut cream sauce. The service was very basic and impersonal. This place is a tourist trap. Even though the scallop dish was great, the overall dining experience does not warrant a return ever again.

Went with friends for lunch, and of course it was busy! We had reservations fortunately, and asked to sit outside (not as loud).We had a great table and terrific waitstaff helping us. I really like how they "tag teamed". Our primary server was busy with other customers and another filled in for her so we didn't have to wait. They explained to us, this is "how we do it here".The cocktails were creative (plus good), the food was incredibly fresh. There were 4 of us, so we each chose an item (they serve family style here), so we could all get a taste of each. We also had a couple of appetizers. The portions were good size....we didn't leave hungry. We did leave with a dent to our pocketbook though. Not inexpensive!For a treat though, I would certainly go again, and recommend it. (Oh, and the bathrooms were immaculate - had an attendant keeping it all cleaned up)

There is no denying that people rave about this place. I have no idea why. My friend and I arrived without a reservation at approximately 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday. We asked for a table for two and were told that there would be no tables whatsoever in the dining room until 9:15 but we were welcome to put our name on a list for two seats at the bar. What a blessing in disguise. The dining room is huge and cramped and LOUD. In comparison sitting at the bar was quiet and unhurried and you could actually carry on a conversation.We ordered food to share: Spring Rolls, Ribs and Sweet Corn. The spring rolls were the best of the three and were actually served "lettuce wrap style." The ribs looked huge and meaty but unfortunately it was nearly impossible to get the meat off the bone. Not with your teeth...not with a knife. The sweet corn had a bit of port in it and was fine. But at $15 a bowl...well, let's just say not a good value for the money. The drinks were good but quite overpriced...even for San Francisco.I won't be going back.

We love Vietnamese food having been introduced to it in the late 1960s. In our view, Slanted Door has the best Vietnamese food in San Francisco and when we know we are going to visit the city our daughter (she lives there) makes reservations (they are virtually mandatory. The view of the bay is "killer". The food is great, Service is wonderful given the fact that the tables and banquets are always full. Meals may be take at the bar as well. but the best tables ate those that look out on San Francisco Bay and the Bay Bridge Even if you have never had Vietnamese food, perhaps especially if you have missed out on the treat, Slanted Door is worth a visit. Just remember, you need to make reservations well in advance.

We were not expecting to eat an expensive lunch on this day in July, but the Slanted Door was our best option. We had eaten there several years ago and loved the dinner. It had just opened and was very popular and serving high quality meals. That description still applies. We entered the restaurant and were seated immediately, outside near the water. Our waiter, Dain, was very helpful with the menu, aiding our selection of a noodle dish and a fish dish. We each ordered a local beer and watched the people stroll by the water. The organic chicken and vermicelli  noodle entree was absolutely delicious. It included an imperial roll, cucumber, mint and peanut. I expected the Arctic Char plate with green mango and Thai chili fish sauce to be the star of the lunch, but was wonderfully surprised. We do not usually order dessert but the Blue Pavlova choice was too interesting to pass up. It was some kind of berry concoction that was great. Our bill was $80 before taxes and tip, but was the best lunch I had ever had on vacation. Pure yummy!

Charles Phan's food is just plain wonderful. A long ago fan of his original location in the Tenderloin area and his books, I hadn't been since he relocated to the Ferry Bldg and was a bit concerned that I should lower my expectations--successful restaurants so often rest on their laurels. But I didn't find that here. Everything we ordered was excellent and reflective of Phan's elevated creativity. Ditto service--food and wine both. (From day one the Door's wine list has been a standout among Asian restaurants.)

This is a great restaurant for groups. You collectively order a mix of dishes and they size the meals to the number of people in your group. We had 8, but one person was vegan, so they created a menu of one for her. Same number of dishes, and the vegan dishes we chose were pooled, but she had her own dishes to replace our slanted beef and organic chicken stir fry. It was all very, very delicious. Service was impeccable. It's a busy restaurant, but they were very on top of things, and we never felt rushed. I'd be happy to go again, and I recommend it highly.

We have been enjoying meals at Chef Phan's Slanted Door since it first opened in the Ferry Plaza Bldg. For the past year (or longer) the Slanted Door has been modifying some of their noteworthy but labor intensive dishes, and the changes are not good news for diners. For example, the Brussels sprouts side has been a longtime signature dish, which even those who were not Brussels sprouts admirers loved. Several months ago the recipe changed and the new Brussels sprouts dish is almost inedible. The waiter explained it now took less time to prepare the sprouts and also admitted it wasn't receiving rave reviews. Slanted Door remains a pleasant place to dine if you are in the Ferry Plaza vicinity, but the title of "Best Vietnamese Restaurant" in SF probably goes to Le Colonial.

Perfect for lunch. Nice staff and directly at the water. Great food and moderate prices. I can recommend for lunch. The noodles are really great. No need to take a starter. You will be full after the main dish

Always busy, but always good :)

Love this busy noisy hub down at the Ferry building in SF- it is large, but seems to cope with the numbers very well. The food is Asian/Thai fusion and delicious. The portions are meant to be shared - and most need to be as they are generous ! Been here a number of times and recommend it to our friends who visit the city.We were also impressed with the information and recommendations from the sommelier- our second visit in one week showed that a number of the waiters do have considerable wine knowledge for pairing with the dishes, so that is a real bonus- use them!! Branzino is scrummy - for two to share unless you are ravenous. On our radar for our next visit to the USA and SF. Best to book a table as there was quite a wait for those who came in on the off-chance of eating.

A memorable lunch with a view!

We were here on a very busy afternoon and we got lucky as we were quickly seated down to a table with a fabulous view of the Bay bridge by a friendly staff and having said that, without a reservation. It being our first time at Slanted Door and visiting from half way across the globe in South East Asia, we found the concept of sharing plates true to the Asian hospitality and flavours authentic.

Had the pleasure of eating here 4 years ago and it was incredible. Came back and it failed to live up to the first visit. The cellophane noodles are still wonderful, but avoid the scrambled egg. Overpriced for the dining experience. The staff were not welcoming, though our waitress was wonderful. 

Delicious (but expensive)

We had a delicious meal at the Slanted Door. Started w the crispy egg rolls and bbq spare ribs, both were delicious but would probably change out the spare ribs next time as they were our least favorite due to being a little tough to bite off the bone. Dinner I'd order the exact same: Claypot chicken, shaking grass beef, the corn, and jasmine rice. The claypot chicken was the best thing by far, but all of it was great. Only con is that it adds up pretty quickly - the shaking beef is > $40 for 5-6 pieces of steak. We didn't have a reservation but were able to sit right down at the bar.

Delicious fare in a bustling setting

This restaurant was recommended to us by friends. It certainly did not disappoint! Certainly not your standard Vietnamese fare.....the menu was creative and diverse. We had crispy imperial spring rolls for an appetizer. Entrees were served family style....we had seared ahi tuna, stir fried chicken with cashews walnuts dates and raisins, and cellophane noodles with Dungeness crab. All we're wonderful, but hands down the stir fried chicken was the best! We did not try dessert. The atmosphere is busting and somewhat loud. The view out the main windows of the bay bridge are awesome, especially around sunset! Service was quick and reliable...and very friendly! Prices are very expensive....as is everything in San Francisco. Really, it's the only downside to our meal.....not super generous portions for what we paid.

I had heard good things about this place. Made a reservation a day in advance for lunch. The place was packed when I arrived. After a few minutes wait, I got a table outside. The space is large with a good bar area, lots of inside tables and a few outside.A rather limited beer menu. Plenty of wines. I had a German dunked.The papaya salad was ok, mild flavors. The Monterey squid was pretty good. I prefer squid grilled or fried usually. This was steamed, however nicely cooked, soft meat. The pineapples in the dish were not my favorite. The jasmine rice is incredibly tasty.Very efficient and friendly waiter. 

Food was as good as advertised - and with a nice view of the bay bridge

Place was hopping when we arrived for a 9:15 res on a saturday night. (no open table - use Yelp Reservations). Table was ready and had nice view of the bay bridge. Tuetonic pinot noir - outstanding wine.Spring rolls (crispy) were delicious. The scallops had creamy sauce on them that was amazing....and the vegetarian yuba noodles were subtly and so very good.

Great Location

Ate at The Slanted Door in the Ferry Building and truly enjoyed the experience. Located right on the water with excellent views of the Bay Bridge. The food was very good and the wait staff was excellent. A definite place to eat while in San Francisco.

On a friend's suggestion we stopped in for a late lunch. We started with fantastic cocktails, of which I absolutely loved my Carter Beats The Devil. I had their spicy ahi tuna tartare, which was outstanding. Perfect tuna, enough spice and delicious rice chips. (I love radish, so that was a bonus!) Even my friend that doesn't love tuna ate half the dish and proclaimed it great. I also enjoyed the lemongrass pork noodles. Every component tasted so fresh and perfectly balanced. I loved every bite! Thank you for a wonderful and memorable meal! I will come back every time we are in San Francisco!

Two of us had crepes and dacron:delicious! The third person said she wanted ribs, but asked the waitperson if the sauce contained fish. She was told yes, also that most things on the menu also used the same sauce. She ordered a salad, had one bite, we ate the rest. Couple at the adjoining table had ribs, said it was impossible to taste any fish ingrediant. two out of three isn't bad.

Very Good

We had a great dinner for four at this downscale place located in the Ferry Building. The food was worthy of the best places in San Francisco. This noisy little restaurant with a gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge is so good that the billionaire owner of the Dallas Cowboys was eating at the next table.

Good, trendy and a bit expensive

While the food was quite good, the service was slow, the restaurant was huge, and the prices were high. We still enjoyed our visit, mostly because the food was so good. We particularly enjoyed the spring rolls (both plain and crispy) and the Shaking Beef was outstanding.I would give it a somewhat lukewarm review -- it is definitely a solid choice to eat, but I think there might be better options in SF, particularly in terms of value.

We booked our dinner reservation to coincide with our return ferry trip from Sausalito. It worked out perfect. We were seated about 5:30 and by 7:00 they were booked solid, but the staff never missed a beat. Food was excellent and the service even better. Inside the ferry building they have a take out section called "Out the Door". Cute marketing take off from their name. Keep up the good work.

Slanted Door is one restaurant that one books a trip around. Book Slanted Door, and then book your airlines and hotel. The food is excellent. We had the imperial spring rolls, green papaya salad, Dungeness crab with cellophane noodles and the carmelized shrimp. Wow the onions with the carmelized shrimp was so good - I normally don't like onions, but these were so tasty. Save room for dessert - you won't be disappointed.The service is great. If I could only get takeout to the 808 state!

We went with four people and ordered many appetizers and four dinners. everything was excellent. The service was great. The view was spectacular overlooking the San Francisco Bridge which had a light show which added to a great experience. The Bronzini is not to be missed. You will not be disappointed. One thing to note is that it is in the back of the building (we had a very hard time finding it).

We spent a month in Vietnam from North to South, and did not experience the high quality of food that one can taste at this restaurant. We did not have any meat dishes. Five of us shared many dishes. It was excellent. We will always return when visiting San Francisco. (reservations suggested)
