Delicious lunch in a relaxing setting together with a friendly team

We visited Coqueta earlier today for a late lunch and were delighted by our choice. The restaurant had been recommended by two different people who live in San Francisco so we should be clear that this restaurant is by no means only for tourists.After a friendly welcome we took to our seats at the counter overlooking the kitchen and opted for a few different tapas. The Pulp a la Parriilla wood grilled Mediterranean octopus with fingerling potato and olive oil was a great combination and absolutely delicious. The Albondigas a la Foria duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry tempranillo salsa with shallots was another clear winner that was quickly devoured! Lastly I would also mention the Gambas Negras, olive oil poached prawns with black garlic and chilli sauce was cooked to perfection.We enjoyed lunch immensely and I can't wait to take people here again in future, not least of all, myself!!

Great b-day dinner. An all around winner!

A great dinner! Date night/birthday celebration so we booked something a little different. Tired the "chef's counter" and to be honest were a little disappointed with the lack of interaction with the chef's, but did enjoy watching them creating the dishes and the flurry of activity. The menu was fun and the food was outstanding. We had been in Barcelona just a couple of weeks earlier, and yet we found the tapas here at Coqueta to be a step above what we had in Spain! The wait staff was very friendly, informative and helpful. The service was prompt and attentive. All and all this was a great dinner and perfect for the occasion.

I wondered in to Coqueta after seeing it from the outside and thinking it looked like quite an upmarket establishment, assuming that the quality of the food matched the decor and the ocean side setting. I could not have been more wrong. On the plus side the service and the cocktail were very good, the food however...the first tapas was the Octopus - the way it was billed on the menu it really sounded pretty amazing, in reality it was borderline inedible - a salty, lank, flavourless, 4 inch tentacle that wasn't so much chargrilled as lightly broiled on the gas hob, the potatoes accompanying being equally as disgusting, I literally had to hold air in my mouth while chewing to detract from the taste. Then came the shrimps with potatoes and egg. Again, to read the description on the menu you would think that Gordon Ramsey himself had crafted this culinary delight. The reality? A fried egg with 4 recently defrosted supermarket prawns (the non-jumbo variety) with some crushed up Ruffles chips. For this and the octopus (about 10-12 mouthfuls in total) I paid $27. I looked at the wine menu thinking this might be their saving grace but it was insanely overpriced, the average bottle being around $60 and wine by the glass averaging about $20. Really shoddy dining experience which is a shame as the interior is done very nicely. Avoid.

We had a lovely evening sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen watching each small plate be made. We ordered several tapas and a reasonably-priced bottle of wine. The place was packed and had quite a buzz to it. A very enjoyable evening.

While living in SF I visited Coqueta many times. I do enjoy the team that is always fun, I love the tapas, and the drinks ahem been great and if you are up for adventure the servers can help you and advise on new drinks and cocktails.Only Tip: Reserve in advance if you want to eat, they are mostly booked out

While we did not find every dish outstanding, it was a fun place for me, my wife, our son and his girlfriend who we were meeting for the first time. Sharing a lot of dishes is a great ice breaker. It wasn't so loud that we could not converse; always a plus. The outside part is very protected- didn't really look like actually sitting outside, which is good at lunch because it could be too warm or too cold depending on weather.Wait staff was attentive and the Sangria was delicious!

High end tapas restaurant, they also have larger plates. Fairly pricey. 5 tapas and 2 drinks was over $100 after a 20% tip but what do you expect in San Francisco. Our favorites were the fried egg with shrimp and shoestring potatoes, the duck meatballs and the papas bravas. Good for a special occasion.

We booked a table in advance at Coqueta after reading fantastic reviews. It was for our last evening in San Francisco and wanted to a great meal and experience before we left - it didn't disappoint. Location is great, right on the waterfront. We wandered down the pier before dinner and got some great photos of the bridge and city. When we arrived it was packed and had a buzzing atmosphere, so id definitely recommend booking a table. The interior has been done brilliantly. We had a seats at the counter so were able to watch the kitchen - very impressive, just to watch the organisation let alone the actual cooking! We had some lovey cocktails and the wine list is great. Food was beautiful - the kale salad and duck meatballs were amazing. The service was exceptional from start to finish. Not the cheapest, but worth it. Would definitely visit again and recommend.

I was here for a business dinner in the glass conservatory - many plates of tapas style small dishes. Each one outstanding from the deviled eggs, the Spanish omelet, octopus through to the mouthful sized dulce de leche cheese cake. The cocktails were outstanding too. Expensive but very good indeed.

This is a modern take on Spanish tapas located on Pier 5 owned by famous chef Michael Chiarello. It is absolutely wonderful! The menu is intimidating for a non foodie but we sat at the bar and watched what was going out of the kitchen and were inspired. The paella is the best we have ever had (even after 2 trips to Spain) and worth the price. The gambas (more shrimp) are amazing. There was a luscious mushroom plate as well. We saw lots of orders for the smoked salmon open faced sandwiches which were the safe and recognizable menu bet but I highly recommend being adventurous here as it is all delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful.There was a $25 corking fee to bring our bottle of wine from Napa. They serve wines from their own very small Chiarrello vineyard. We had found out about Coqueta at their tasting room in Yountville, Napa Valley. Their wines are delicious especially the very unique Chiaro Rose.We had a VERY fun evening.

We were really keen to try out this Michael Chiarello restaurant. First impressions were of a busy, happening type restaurant - highish wooden tables with chairs to match.Servers are obviously highly trained but the main event - the food - did not have much flavour and is overpriced.We picked six tapas plates between two of us - chorizo, artichoke and pepper $2.75 (bite sized pieces literally - needed one each), padron peppers with serrano ham $10 ( peppers were fine but the ham is about three shavings used as a garnish), prawns in garlic ( cooked with the head on and served with toast), pork and duck meatballs $14 ( sweet tasting but no flavour), chicken croquettes $9 ( okay but bland) and chef's cheese selection ( included nice almonds and three cheeses - nothing outstanding).Croquttes, meat balls and prawns came in three pieces - not much fun when there are two people. We mentioned this to a young manager who said several customers had complained about that previously and that the management was brainstorming about it.. I then asked how long the restaurant had been open and he said four years - surely after that length of time a solution could be found!

This is a small intimate space with excellent food and sangria. Portions are not huge but the flavor,service and ambiance were exactly what we wanted. This is not a chain restaurant with huge portions and not good for families. But it's perfect for couples or those wanting really good food and a quiet place to catch up. Recommend the chefs choice of cheese and meats and the potatoes, octopus and eggplant. 

Best Tapas in San Francisco

This is by far our favourite way to eat as a couple. We've had Tapas in Spain, Chicchetti in Venice, Pintxos in Basque Country, Sunday Roasts in England and Family style in Italy. Next year we are looking forward to Mezze in Greece. Either we just can't make up our minds or we subscribe to the "sharing is caring" school of thought. Whatever the reason is that we love these small plate menus no matter what they are called they are consistently our favourite menus. Coqueta is no exception. A few years back I tried Iberico Ham for the first time here at Coqueta and I became hooked. The thinly sliced, melt in your mouth experience the first time you try Jamon Iberica is memorable. Then the disappointment sets in when you find out that it is not readily available in Canada :( The Iberico infused cocktail continues to pull me back every trip to San Fran however the menu has many other fantastic tapas dishes that were just a good as we encountered on our recent trip to Spain. The Croquetas, Patatas Bravas, Duck and Pork Meatballs, Manchego and the Paella are all so authentic and delicious. Can't wait until my next visit!

Reserved this restaurant on a family vacation because we love tapas, and the reviews were good. It definitely did not disappoint! It definitely did not seem like a family dining place, but more a hip millennial after work hangout. The bar was certainly full. The restaurant is energetic and bustling, with somewhat loud music playing continually. It is not a place for a romantic meal. Service was pretty good....friendly, knowledgeable, relatively quick. Favorite dishes: duck and pork meatballs, grilled octopus, paella.We had 7 tapas dishes plus paella, and one alcoholic beverage for $135...4 people. We would definitely go back, maybe not with the kids this time.

Everything we ordered tasted the same. Yes, the Paella tasted like the meatballs, which tasted like the potatoes, which tasted like the shrimp. It seems like their cooking oil (some kind of chili/vegetable taste) overwhelmed each plate. Add this to being squeezed in the corner with a drum used as a table - it wasn't what our group appreciates.

There were three of us for dinner last night, two locals and me, visiting San Francisco. They recommended this small tapas restaurant right on the Embarcadero, at Pier 5. The outside bar area was chaotic as you would expect for a Friday night, and they had our reservation for 5 PM waiting when we got there a few minutes late. I recommend an early reservation as the place filled up quickly soon after we received our first dish.We ordered the fried potatoes, grilled octopus, Gulf shrimp, and mushroom medley (I forgot the actual dish names from the menu, sorry) and these tapas dishes were superb. We were very hungry so we also got the paella for three. That was outstanding! One person had a non-alcoholic drink and two of us had a mojito and a glass of sangria. The total bill, before tip, came to $180. Of course, we knew that would be the case since we ordered from the menu, but you should realize the prices are a bit steep; given how outstanding the food and service were, and the location, I would say this is worth the splurge at least.

The location with a view of the sea is really wonderful and so is the possibility of sitting outside in a sheltered patio observing the wind blowing away the people on the street. Drinks are good, but not too generous (the frothy tops look good, but it's just foam). The tapas are also ridiculously overpriced for what you get. You pay the location, that's clear. Service is not too quick, we had almost finished our first round when we received our tapas. The waiters are nice. I would not choose to go back unless you are really looking for a sheltered sea view.

But the style they handled the situation was not very polite and they were mainly interested in getting rid of us as soon as possible. Never visit again!

There seemed to be something going on between the manager and staff...everyone was so unhappy that worked there and you could see the manager getting mad at servers in front of the hostess desk. Food was not good at least what we ordered...Paella. It was burnt on the bottom and tasted terrible in fact if the server would have checked on us at any point of our dining for more drinks or food we would have asked for something else and showed her the burnt bottom. Nobody checked on us and another waiter dropped our bill off so we just paid the bill and left and got another meal at Waterfront restaurant. Price is on the high side for what you get and I would definitely never go back. This place left a bad taste in our mouth....LITERALLY

What is with the PSST thing? Positively.Sumptuous.Savory.Tapas.That is what with PSST!Before the food, a word or three about the service. Totally conscientious, and much appreciated. Because of very serious allergies, the server was informed of that before the order was placed. What she did was to carefully scrutinize the menu, and then cross out the dishes that would trigger adverse reactions. Some of the offerings could be modified, and she made it clear how that was done. A terrific beginning to a superb experience.Now to the food: House cured Jamon Serrano. Yummy. White anchovies, wonderful olives, pearl onions, and piparra pepper. Another yummy. Of course, patatas bravas. Bravo to the patatas. Yes, a full yummy unit. And then, pimentos with padron peppers and Spanish ham. No surprise: a total yummy unit. Almost forgot to mention yet another delish dish: chorizo roasted artichoke with the appropriate pepper. Score one more Y U.The dishes were served in a timely and gracious manner, all that you could ask for but oh so rarely receive.To top off the tapas dishes, for dessert we had a fabulously fantastic warm, molton rice with cream, huckleberries and rice ice-cream. Just sensational.Yes, a memorable meal.

We met friends here for lunch on a Thursday. Our friends had reserved a table, but it was far from the best one in the dining room (walk-ins had the better ones). Fortunately there was space in the lovely, bright bar area, which turned out to be better for our lunch visit anyway. A prawn dish (Gambas Negras, I think), roasted asparagus with Romescu sauce, and "Sunny side-up" Huevo were all superb. Even simple starter plates of almonds and olives didn't last long with us. I enjoyed a glass of a local IPA on tap. Service was very good. If I lived near this place I would go back often.

She paced the arrival of the delicious tapas to work well during the hour and a half we spent at the bar pavilion area. All of the food and wine (I had a particularly nice white sangria) was outstanding. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, which I'd love to work my way through during future visits to SF. The waterfront setting and ambiance are also lovely.

We 3 foodies had to make a reservation for lunch at this place an entire month in advance. This should have told us something right off the bat. We heard that the food was good, but we were skeptical of the fact that the restaurant was owned by a TV chef, and it was located right on prime waterfront property in SF. Sounded to us like big famous name, high prices, mediocre tourist food. Boy, were we wonderfully surprised. Being the true foodies we are, we ordered a ton of food to try to taste everything. Best in show: the salmon appetizer, the 32 oz gaucho bistec,the paella, and the dessert churro. We also ordered the grilled shrimp, the devilled egg, the pork/duck meatballs and the sunny side up huevo w/ crispy potatoes. (I know, nary a green vegetable to be found among our choices, but we spied some salads at other tables that looked amazing.). The thing that stood out above all was that everything we ordered BURST with unexpected flavor that just surrounded and saturated our taste buds. The specialty cocktails were delicious, and served in stemless balloon goblets complete with a sprig of fresh edible flower. Presentation was excellent; wait staff was friendly and informative, It's a bit pricey, but if you want a "dining experience," this is a grand place to go. (Dinner reservations may have to be made more than a month in advance, so plan ahead.)

My family and I had dinner here ten days ago and I was really disappointed. While the location is lovely and unique and the bar scene appears exciting for a younger crowd, I thought the food was marginal and way overpriced and it was way too loud to carry on a conversation. Our bill for 5 adults was almost $300 with only two glasses of wine total ( and water for the rest of us).The menu says their paella feeds 2-3; they unilaterally doubled the paella order (and cost) without telling us, but it didn't look any bigger than a single order. Oh well, I won't be back.

Coqueta is a very beautiful and trendy restaurant on pier 5 featuring Spanish food. At first, the beauty of the place and the food presentation and platters blow your mind away but then the food disappoints you and turns out to be good not great. The croquettes were very good so was the octopus. Forget about the tortilla, very dry, and the shrimp very oily...The patatas bravas were very good And original but the urchin appetizer tasteless. The paella which was totally overpriced was somewhat dry, a lot of rice and the shellfish, chorizo etc rather lacking... A nice place to go to for drinks and a few bites rather than a meal.

Great place for drinks, tapas, dinner.

The bar here is one of my favorite places. Right on the Embarcadero very near the Ferry Building. The cocktails are really outstanding, done with much care and knowledge. The tapas is also terrific. I highly recommend!

We had a seat at the bar and could see the chefs preparing the food which was an added bonus. The food was exceptional and the service staff very knowledgeable about the food and wine. The smoked salmon with queso fresco and truffle honey was a recommendation from the waitress. Not something I would have ordered without being prompted, but it was sensational.

Excellent Paella, as good as the best ones that we had in Spain. The coqueta chicken was also very good. The only slight negative is that the food was overly salty. Service was professional and courteous.

We had a great night at this cool Spanish restaurant on the embarcadero. It's a beautiful, happening place with a great vibe. Hillary, our waitress, was excellent. I started with one of their gin and tonic drinks, which was excellent and beautiful. We had a couple of quartinos of an excellent Grenache blend. We grazed our way through a number of really good tapas. Three of us split an excellent paella. I was bummed out, because a lot of the people around us were ordering a gorgeous, gargantuan ribeye steak. We just couldn't do it. The restaurant was busy and the paella took quite a while to come out. The manager comped us some wine and dessert. We were fine with it, because we were enjoying the evening. We visit San Francisco two or three times per year and this is one of the best restaurants that we have found. Highly recommended!

This is my second time visiting Coqueta for lunch and I was not disappointed. Memorable plates were the side of mushrooms, and the meatballs made with duck and pork. The restaurant is small and personally I would rather sit in the bar side as opposed to the kitchen side. One negative regardless of where you sit is that the chairs are not that comfortable and the tables a titch small. Reservations are necessary for peak meal times. If you are a fan of Spanish food, this is a must when in San Francisco. 

Trendy, yummy, and a bit pricey.

We had to make reservations 2 weeks in advance for a Tuesday night. We sat at the counter tops overlooking the kitchen and had a wonderful waitress who gave great recommendations and description of the dishes. I highly recommend getting a gin & tonic here. As they have about 9 different variations here (the Barca is my favorite). We got the charcuterie plate for two, gambas negras ( delicious but very small portions), croquetas de pollo, pulpo a la parilla and we were very happy with our foodI would not recommend the arroz con leche for desert. Although the food was delicious the portions were small (even for tapas) and pricey - so be prepared

The food was very good and offered an excellent variety of tapas. However, this could quickly become an expensive evening if you arrive very hungry. We visited Coqueta late in the evening after having appetizers earlier at the Hog Island Oyster Bar. We enjoyed being able to try various Spanish wines and found the service to be good and friendly. Nice, warm bar-like ambience.

Choose Somewhere Else

I visited this restaurant about six months ago, so admittedly, things might have changed. I chose this restaurant due to the proximity to the Bay Bride Light Show and the Pier for an even walk afterwards. However, I found the experience below average. I had made reservations and we arrived early only to find out that our seats had been given away and we were given the option to wait for a table or sit at the bar. Because we had been sight-seeing all day and were tired and hungry (and it was late- 9:30PM) we chose to just grab a seat at the bar. The restaurant itself was packed and bustling. Tables were crammed together and it seems like a hot Friday night spot. I chose a pinot noir which was terrible. I rarely ever ask for an exchange but I simply could not down this wine. I switched to a merlot which was fine. The food came out quickly and was just average. I will say that despite it being crowded and having to navigate through the throngs of people everywhere waiting to be seated, our server was exceptionally pleasant. Bottom line: choose somewhere else or arrive very early.

Expensive, but worth it!

Lunch for two, with two drinks each, is an easy $100 - but so tasty and service is exceptional. We didn't regret the money we spent! Plus the view is amazing on the water!

This is a tapas restaurant. You must make reservations before hand. Service was good, but the tapas were limited and expensive. The chicken croquettes were really good.

Nice pier-side location with good views on a beautiful day. Never mind that the background bossa nova music is not Spanish, it's cool. We should have been weary that the croquettes appeared within 2 minutes of ordering - they were heated up, pre-cooked items and not very yummy. In fact, the tapas ranged from extremely pedestrian to OK - nothing to scream about. The white sangria is too sweet. Btw, the waiters are friendly and efficient, but not coquettish, certainly not the male ones. Prices look reasonable on the menu, but portions are Lilliputian, so on average you may end up spending $60 per pax.

Fun data night but be aware they have a bunch of communal tables so you might have to share. It can get loud in the main dining room - so it will be yummy but perhaps not very romantic. We sat at the bar in front of the open kitchen - great view into the action but be aware it can get very warm.

Loved this place! "Tapas" allow you to try a bunch of different plates and tastes. We started off with the Chef's Selection of Iberian Cheeses served with membrillo (quince paste), and it was delicious! Went on to try a couple of the "Bite-Size Skewers" (Chorizo and Manchego), followed by a Salmon Ahumado (smoked salmon) open face sandwich, the grilled Brotes de Broccoli, and Albondigas a la Feria (duck and pork meatballs). That was more than enough, . . . but, I had to try the grilled octopus, which I had never tasted. I was expecting it to be like calamari, but was pleasantly surprised it tasted more like scallops. Everything was delicious! We had to be careful, though, and pace ourselves, because it's easy to overdo it, and simply eat too much! We sat inside the restaurant, and not in the bar adjacent (which is where you would have a view of the waterfront). We didn't have a view, but it didn't matter to us. Definitely make reservations!

Great All Around!

The food is tapas and all of it, as there were many of us and much food was ordered, was amazing. Great service too. The atmosphere is warm and close with a great fun vibe. Drinks are generous and the staff seem to love working there. Do not miss this restaurant when in San Fran.

Coqueta is popular with locals and tourists. It's always packed so it will be a good idea to make a reservation before you go. It serves good Spanish food. The sangria is a tad too sweet for me. I generally like the place but the service can be better. The waiter forgot to place our drink order and was slow. 

Enjoy a trip to SPAIN while in SF!

Another masterpiece from Chef Chiarello! Outstanding small plates and excellent Spanish wine selection, including the requisite Jerez. Great place to go with friends. Order up and share it all. Usually need a reservation but bar is a nice alternative if you can find a spot. Great scene. Que aproveche!

Coqueta is a tapas restaurant, so you can spend and eat as little or as much as you want. We choose to spend and eat a lot. I loved everything we had at this restaurant. Very friendly and helpful service. Beautiful location down at the embarcadero.

Had an awesome lunch there and tried a little of everything. Every dish but one (sea urchin on toast) was a HIT! Wines were great, service was good but got spotter as it got busy. I can see this place would probably have trouble keeping up if its really busy -- my advice is visit during off hours and you will have a better experience. Want to come back and try the giant ribeye!

Excellent patatas bravas but burned paella; yes dry &amp; burned

Creative tapas such as amazing patatas bravas. Cute porron liquor options - would be great if Chiarelo made some not so sweet. The Mexican coke porron will rot your teeth. The octopus is very well executed. The egg/brunch dish is very tasty as well. The best part of the paella is the cork trivet it's served on ( found at a V market store for $30 and created & sold by a Napa limo driver) the paella has zero moisture- downright over cooked. Embarrassing for a Spanish place - even if the owner is an Italian chef with an awful personal reputation in Napa. Ironically his Spanish restaurant is infinitely more inspired than Bottega - his extremely underwhelming restaurant in Yountville.

We took a family vacation to San Fran this past holiday week and this restaurant was a top stop and excited to say did not disappoint. Reservations are taken 30 days out and I highly recommend you do it. It is a small place and extremely popular and sits on the water in the Embarcadero on Pier 5. We sat inside. Beautiful and rustic with super high ceilings. Tapas style and everything we ordered was wonderful. Great attentive and knowledgeable server and staff and overall a wonderful epicurean inspired evening. Never felt rushed and yes its expensive but when you do it right it is worth the cost.

Excellent preparations of typical tapas, as good as what we've had in Spain ... great ingredients and preparation. Spain is a fountain of wine and that bounty is on full display here including an extensive Sherry listing.It was raining the day we visited but on a nice day the views from the bar area are fine indeed. This is expensive real estate and the prices reflect that but overall really worth it. Worth a trip!

After dining at Bottega in Yountville I saw a card for Coqueta so I booked for the next night. It turned out the Coqueta is in a building on the Embarcadero not far from the Ferry Building and walking distance from our hotel in the Financial District/Chinatown. We sat in the bar and ordered cocktails. Mine was a gin and tonic that arrived in a large stemless wine glass garnished with juniper berries and a tropical flower with a side of artisanal tonic water - fancy and cool. The food is tapas - shareable yet filling.
