Best Chinese I have eaten in - but expensive

The restaurant is located on the second floor and accessed by an elevator. Once in the restaurant, you can enjoy the view over Kearney and Mission streets. The food is very good - dim sum was excellent as was the peppered steak. Very attentive service. Good wine list too. Because of the price, this is probably a place you'd only eat at once - but if you like Chinese food and you want a high-end dining experience, this is a good place to consider.

We reserved a table for two online for a Saturday 6:00 p.m. Seating. We took the elevator to the second floor restaurant. We were warmly greeted and seated promptly in the swanky restaurant. The decor is immaculate and the many staff efficient and attentive. Our server was entertaining and very helpful when making appropriate selections. We enjoyed a meat dim sum selection of six items to start, followed by egg fried rice, sweet and sour pork and a leafy vegetable dish including lotus leaves, celery and asparagus. The manager surprised us with a complimentary chef's signature dessert, the Asian Pear tart with creamy chocolate filling. It was truly a work of art. The entire evening was superb. A lovely way to end our California vacation.

Very upscale Chinese restaurant. The bar is a great place to have a quick bite, or have a drink while waiting for your table. The food is unique, affordable and elegant. The do have a dish with caviar for $248.00, and a chicken noodle dish for $8; and many choices in between. great to have a variety in such an elegant setting.

Have been to this place before but more recently now. The dim sum is really great - freshly, hot and served as you eat. There are no chicken dim sum items, but are not missed.Pork, seafood and vegetable varieties are plenty. We had pork ribs, shrimp, vegetarian items and also sides of rice. Great ambience in the middle of a bustling down town (Kearny and Market Street).

You will love Hakkasan if you like:Ordinary Chinese food at extraordinary prices;In a stunning, exquisitely designed, setting convenient to the financial district, major hotels and convention center;A sense of being special by being allowed upstairs by the polite doorman at the entrance;Beautiful and beautifully dressed servers who are pleasant but often inattentive;Welcoming long bar with a crowd of thirty-something professionals enjoying the drinks and the company;Enough crowd noise to drown out any chance of conversation with anyone who is not directly next to or across from you;Exacerbated by a jarring techno-disco sound track at an inappropriately loud volume;The restaurant's temerity in adding an "SF Labor Mandate" surcharge to pay for their employee healthcare;--- AND someone else is paying the tab.I suggest this would be a great place to go by yourself to eat and drink at the bar. If you are with a group hoping to enjoy a quiet special dinner with great food I suggest you go somewhere else.

I am already looking forward to my next opportunity to dine at Hakkasan. We were a group of five businessmen sharing a meal in family style. We began with the Hakka steamed dim sum platter (the pepper duck dumpling was my favorite) and then had a succession of great dishes. Grilled Sea Bass, Sweet and Sour Pork Tenderloin, a Beef Dish and topped off with Peking Duck. The waiter thought we had over-ordered but we proved him wrong. Great service and the quality of the dishes was excellent. I recommend highly!

Even as you walk in and directed to go upstairs you know its a trendy place with lot of smartly dressed young people. The music is loud which relieves you of any need to have any meaningful conversation . The food is fusion - interesting but not great. Judging by how difficult it is to get a table last minute - that's what the customers must want.

This was a most enjoyable experience from start to finish. Immediately addressed by the first floor attendant and then again when coming off the elevator by the hostesses. Ambience is upscale, tasteful and just the right decor to give it a modern Asian feel. My daughter is vegan and the server was most accommodating on the appropriate dishes to consider as well which dishes they could modify. We had a relatively light number of dishes but they were all perfectly prepared, ranking this as the best Chinese and dining experience in this category.

We were in San Francisco for 2 days and decided to eat here for one of our dinners because of the rave reviews. My first impression, upon stepping off of the elevator was that that this was a swanky place -- the decor was very nice with a lot of Asian influence, but not over the top like in the Chinese movies. We were early so we had a couple of drinks at the bar. Once our table we ready, we were seated next to a large group. They were very loud which detracted from my experience here, but I did not take off any stars. The appetizers were delicious as were the entrees. Great flavors and not greasy. People will ask why pay $200 for a Chinese dinner when you can get it cheaper somewhere else... because you get better quality! You get meat options like ribeye and kobe beef! The flavors are fantastic and the food is not overly greasy. We will definitely eat here again the next time we are in San Francisco.

My business partner and I took a client who is moving abroad for a farewell dinner here. It was not the first time we have been there, but it was his. We must preface this with the fact that this is a beautiful restaurant and certainly an obvious choice to impress a client. We had a number of dishes including the dumpling sampler, the duck salad and the spare ribs, all of which were good. That is pretty much where it ended. The service was some of the worst I have experienced in a restaurant that is noted among other things for its service. At one point our server walked by while I was trying to get his attention and although he had to have heard me, simply kept walking. Another time our guest had to get up and get the attention of the manager to get service. All in all we ordered numerous dishes, cocktails, wine and dessert. This dinner was not only disappointing as an expensive "experience" but it was embarrassing to be "invisible" to our server in front of a client. I would be hard pressed to recommend this restaurant to anyone as either a business or personal destination.

We met up with our friends from France at Hakkasan. As soon as we arrived, we were given our table. We had reserved on Open Table. The service was outstanding and the staff even found a French-speaking waiter for our friends. We had the dim sum and a few small appetizers. The food was excellent, very tasty however the portions are rather small. Also, be prepared to eat in a very hip spot in Union Square and be prepared to dine in a noisy environment.

My husband and I were in search of Chinese restaurant for dinner on a two-day trip to San Francisco and we chose Hakkasan on the basis of reviews. It has branches around the world, and one--though not this one--has a Michelin star, so we thought that we could not go that wrong. We were very disappointed by the meal and the experience. The food was over-priced for what it was--very average (softshell crab) to below average (in the case of the sea bass). The wait staff was pretentious and inattentive. They disappeared for long periods of time, leaving our wine glasses empty (the bottle was stored far off), and brought the dishes out at strange intervals, which resulted in one of the dishes getting cold. When we asked if the dish could be warmed up, we were told, after consultation with the manager, that it could not! The price was far too high, just to be in the same space as people who thought they were hip and cool.

Fresh ingredients. Great ambience

Okay, so I'll start by saying that Hakkasan wasn't what I was looking for. I came here for lunch one afternoon looking for dim-sum and yelp suggested Hakkasan as it was pretty close to my location. This is not an authentic Chinese restaurant, but rather an upscale restaurant with a cantonese bent. The Chicken and abalone shumai was pretty good as was their Sea bass daikon roll. The sticky rice in lotus leaf was really good. The Chinese green vegetables were not bad. However, their salt and pepper squid was way over-fried and not at all what I was expecting. It did not taste good at all. If you come for dim-sum order several dishes, because the size of the dishes is pretty small. The Jasmine tea here was delicious. Contrary to what has been written in the reviews, I found the service to be quite good. A bit reserved and formal, but not at all snooty. The ambience is excellent. You also get the feeling that all of the ingredients that go into the food at Hakkasan are top quality. However, if you're in the mood for authentic dim-sum, I'd suggest finding some restaurants near China town.

My husband booked this because they cater for coeliacs and it didn't disappoint. The food was delicious and the gluten free sweet and sour pork was amazing. Husband had the lobster and he had no complaints. The staff were lovely and the surroundings quite plush.

San Francisco Hakkasan's ambiance and the presentation of their dishes provides for a unique and trendy flair on Asian cuisine. However, the overall service and quality of food for our table ranged from fair to lacking. Although some of the dishes were reasonably well prepared, such as the sweet & sour pork tenderloin and the sea bass, the dim sum and vegetable dishes, in contrast to other neighboring Chinese restaurants, were moderately good at best. As for service, instead of making eye contact, our server's eyes kept surveying other tables while taking our order. Perhaps, that is why we ended up with one less dish than requested. Overall, an underwhelming experience.

I've been using Trip Advisor for easily 4-5 years for dining out of our home area. You'll always see a few reviews that give poor reviews to even top rated restaurants. Up until now that had never happened to us. Sad to say this time it did. First off the place is incredibly noisy. Tables a little too close to each other for my liking. I will say the decor is indeed nice. But that's about the only think I can say was above average. Service was slow, prices were very high and the food was mediocre. San Francisco is an expensive city to visit but you should expect top notch service and quality of food to go along with the price. Absolutely did not happen at Hakkasan, to bad. Compared to recently eating at NOBU in NY I'd rate this place as simply very poor. I'm shocked at how many people gave such stellar reviews. This was a one and done. Never again.

My brother who lives in SF took us here and had told us all day how the food was, we got here and yes the food was amazing but our server had a long way to improve even though it was not a busy night. It took an hour and a half to get most of our mains and sides and then we were left waiting 45 mins for our truffled duck with no explanation or anything, when it did arrive they left one of our other orders. We had to order drinks multiple times because they just didn't come and the poor service just really overshadowed the food.

The food and drinks were exquisite. Excellent vegetarian and seafood options. Each dish was delicious. Service was odd. It was our first time to this specific restaurant and asked for guidance about how much to order. The waitress recommended the set meal for our table of four, but we were not interested in all eating the same thing as one of us was vegetarian. The waitress could not offer us guidance on how much the portions were or what combination of items would be a complete meal. We ended up over-ordering. There were a few novel ingredients and the waitress could not describe them at all, just giggled and said they were hard to describe (like what a wolfberry is--turns out it's the same thing as a goji berry). The kitchen staff who brought the dishes were great sources of information. We ordered after dinner beverages and the waitress messed up two out of four of them (just brought the wrong things).

I have been here twice in the last month (once for work and once with friends) and am anticipating my next visit.

Not that anything else we had was not good, (wok fried tiger prawns, grilled sea bass & fried rice), but the others stood out and I had both during each visit. The service and the atmosphere reminded me of a classic movie (and you need to bring your wallet). Cant wait to try the Hong Kong Dusk smoked bourbon drink that I have been told is amazing....

The rice was not elevated in any way and was boring. The sea bass was OK, not amazing. Finally, the music was monotonous and annoying - essentially the same beat all night long. I happily pay top dollar for amazing food, not when the food and service are average.

The food at Hakkasan is superlative. Every dish we ordered was better than the last. The restaurant is quiet, and most attractively decorated. The service is slick and unobtrusive -- the wait staff are well trained.One suggestion. The menu on the Web lists the various items, but does not include prices. I think this is a mistake, because it gives the impression that the prices are so exorbitant that they dare not publish them! On the contrary, the dishes at Hakkasan are no more expensive than at other fine dining restaurants.I strongly recommend Hakkasan.

We visited Hakkasan with friends we hadn't seen for many years with a lot to catch up on. The service was unobtrusive, they found a quiet table , the food and wine was delicious. They didn't push more food than we needed or try to persuade us to go for more expensive wines in spite of a very impressive wine list. Would definitely go again.

We visited the restaurant for a business dinner, and it did not disappoint. The restaurant doesn't only deliver great food, but also great ambience. From the smells that greets you in the lobby, to the decor and beautifully presented delicious food.Highly recommended.

We had dinner at Hakkasan the weekend after Valentine's. It's our first time to have dinner with a reservation at this location. Last time we were here, we were walk ins with no reservation and sat at the bar. Nice ambience. For drinks we ordered the Hong Kong dusk and hakkatini. We also ordered the crispy foie gras salad in spicy plum dressing and the Peking duck with pancakes. Our dessert was the Asian pear tart. It was a nice dinner and a pricey one. 

Good food, nice venue and decent prize level

On trip to San Fran with the teens, we wanted to try dim sum. Read some reviews and came here for lunch. The restaurant is beautiful. Our waitress was great- very helpful and friendly. Since we hadn't had dim sum before, we were a bit overwhelmed by the choices. She offered to make some choices for us. Wow! She did great! Everything was delicious. Also, we ordered the crispy duck salad which was wonderful. The whole experience was relaxing and very enjoyable. Not cheap but a good value compared to the quality of some other meals we had in the city.

Awful . Not staff management . If you are going to put yourself out there as the best .. be the best .. 15 minutes for an after drink 20 minutes for warm not hot coffee

Swanky modern Chinese restaurant bar with great wine/craft cocktail section in San Francisco, CA

Great bar/restaurant area near Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco, CA. Extensive wine list and great craft cocktails with many originals. Appetizers are quite good with lots of "Chinese fusion" going on. Lots of dining room and big rooms for business events. Great to entertain clients or team dinner while in San Francisco, CA.

We love this dimsum fusion restaurant in our beloved hometown of San Francisco. Great ambiance and extremely delectable cuisine served in delicate ways. My favorite will always be the crispy duck salad and the dimsum platter.

Treat yourself to an amazing dining experience

I had very high expectations of Hakkasan after reading some glowing reviews and I wasn't disappointed. The first thing that strikes you is just how sophisticated and stylish the place is but stilling knowing you're in a Chinese restaurant. There's no doubt it has a price list to match the surroundings but it's worth it. The food is amazing and they had me after the first dish of crispy duck salad. The beef tenderloin, pipa duck and roasted silver cod were all taste sensations. There's a cracking wine list too. Service was very attentive and if I'm being a bit picky perhaps a little bit over the top. Treat yourself.

Quality oozes from every pore of this international chain and the San Francisco branch did not disappoint. From making my favourite cocktail perfectly and not on menu to the sublime dim sum and black truffle duck everything was outstanding. Not a bargain but what good things are? Go, but leave room for me on my next visit please.

Quite good - feeling generous and rounding up to 4

Good food (crispy duck salad is great), respectable cocktails, decent service (if a little hierarchical and snobby), stylish digs. We have been twice and there are still some things on the menu we would like to try, so we will probably be back. Also my dining partner does not care for traditional American-Chinese restaurants but does enjoy Hakkasan. Note: crispy fish was quite fishy, the person who ordered it did not like it at all. Also note: the bill is not like traditional American-Chinese restaurants: $200 for a party of 3 for lunch with only one cocktail.

Great food and cocktails

We had a nice dinner starting with dim sums to share, followed by the beef tenderloin and pipa duck. Caring, respectful and fast service, amazing food. We also tried the lychee martini and the pink mojito, both great. Definitely on the pricy side in San Francisco, as we paid $200 for the above (and two glasses of red wine), but the experience and the food is worth the price. 

Great experience!

I didn't really look through the menus, nor did I order anything as we simply shared few starters and mains I can say though that everything was great!What exceed expectations were the veggie dumplings - wow!And the chicken which was crispy coated with a sweet orange flavored dressing.As for the desert, all was great, but the one that was truly great is the mini puffs accompanied with some sort of green tea ice-cream, awesome!The wine, Californian cab was a perfect choice and total price was around $100 per person inclusive of wine and cocktailsNot expensive given the great food and atmosphere, definitely recommend for business dinner!

Getting boring...

After having tried Hakkasan in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha and being a regular at these locations, I tried the one in San Francisco. Perhaps it is me but I am getting bored with the same menu at the Hakkasan locations - dim sum basket, pipa duck, wagyu beef, soft shell crab etc...there seems to be no variety in their menus and I have not seen any new dishes in a very long time. Their Chinese New Year set-menu was a selection of a la carte items, so really nothing special. Yes, the food they serve is still good - but not fantastic! - and from the crowd the restaurant pulls, no-one seems to care much about the menu but I believe for regular diners like myself, a few new menu items once in a while would be appreciated. Service was efficient but again, very American with little or no personal touch but all rehearsed sentences. Hakkasan is still a good restaurant but with no innovation, they might soon see an end to their success!

Hakkasan SF impressed my by their service, delicious & variety of cocktails and superb dim sums. Service and staff was very friendly and attentive. Chatting and joking,making us feel like home. Hakkasan has a lot of yummy cocktails to choose and try. I tried 3 new drinks and all of them were perfect.Last but not least, the dim sums were top. Taste and form. Every bite was a true experience, wanted us to order more more and more.It is expensive, but it is worth a try... You only live once :)

Hakkasan is trendy place, and there is a very comfortable dedicated bar space. But you need to be prepared - it's very costly, and if you want to visit a bar only, maybe you should consider other options (or be ready to overpay =)

Amazing restaurant in beautiful surroundings. It really has an up market night club atmosphere and very elegant. The food was amazing my prawns were terrific and cocktails blowing your mind. It was definitely the best Chinese meal ever. Although the dessert was a bit disappointing but did not spoil the overall effect of the meal experience. The outside lights do glare if you sit facing but move to another table

For some reason there was a major mix up with our booking which was for 5.30. They called me to confirm and said it was for 10.00 or thereabouts. All sorted and actually changed to 6.30 which was better. We had the ribs - very good, steamed dim sum - very good, soup - good, crispy prawns - excellent. Mains of Chilean bass - excellent, pipa duck - not hot enough and way too excited expensive, a chicken dish - good rice and one round at the bar plus one glass of wine with dinner. It's good but I think that the cost is just way too high. It was over $300 with a tip and frankly the duck is not worth $38 and the prices aren't justified. Ok so it's got a reputation but in my opinion it's just too expensive. Nice touch at the end to bring a single free macaron for the birthday boy.

Been wanting to try dim sum in the city for some time. Came up to SF for a concert, decided on Hakkasan for lunch. Place is beautiful ! Upscale, sophisticated and modern. Among other good adjectives! Sat at bar before being seated. Loved the variety of signature cocktails. Had the fantastic "Floating Goddess", very light in flavor & refreshing. Got our table and we each ordered the 3 item lunch choice. I started with a mushroom with nuts lettuce wraps. Nice small amount for a beginning. Next the spicy shrimp with lily bulb & almonds. Both of these so flavorful! Then enjoyed their macaroons for dessert. Service fantastic, friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back!

Authentic and great

Just returned from china where we ate at some the great local establishments and was wondering how this highly rated SF establishment would compare... answer is it did very well. The dim sum was incredible and the spicy shrimp very flavorful ... the deep fried cod was delicate and tasty

Shouldn't judge a book by its cover and all that but the outside of this place is odd. I've been to the UK one and that is far more glitzy. Anyway, the food here is sublime. 4 of us dined and ordered quite a few starters; duck salad, crispy prawn dumplings, dim sum selection and mushrooms which came with lettuce. All were so so good. Our waiter was fab, service here is very good and the pink mojito cocktail is fab. My main of spicy prawns with Lilly bulb and almonds was delish and my husbands cod was sweet and perfectly cooked. Great place

What I really liked about this restaurant was the atmosphere - sophisticated, sultry and elegant. We were seated, after being at the bar for about 15 minutes, and service was prompt and polite. We had 5 dishes - the dumplings, the pork spare ribs, the claypot chicken, the oxtail and the Jasmine rice. The dumplings and the rice were the highlights, both were well prepared and delicious. What I found really odd about all of the other dishes was that they were not cut up into bite sized pieces! We were given a spoon and chopsticks but many one of the pieces of meat were too large to eat without cutting them. Trying to get the oxtail off of the bone, without the bone flying across the room was also a challenge. I suppose I should have requested a knife? We had cocktails and wine all of which were great. Other than that, expect very rich food. All in all it was good, but not extraordinary.

I came while staying in the theater district. It's easy to walk to from there. We ate here one day then brought our local friend a couple days later, it was worth sharing. The cocktails were outstanding! We had the Hong Kong Dusk and the Old Fashioned. Ice rocks were gorgeous and drinks were well-prepared. The hot and sour soup was a nice change from the standard version. The spicy prawn and dim sum platter were our lunch and were wonderful. We added on one or two other items. Fried rice was outstanding. I never eat rice but I did for both of these visits. Service was a little slow at times, but lunch is very crowded (also loud). Interesting bar that I would like to hold down for a while during my next visit to SF. Enjoy! This is a great restaurant!

Authentic Cantonese in Sleek Setting

I had my doubts about this place when I first went because it looked too trendy and fusion cuisine's usually disappointing. However, I have been pleasantly surprised about the authentic flavors of the dim sum and entrees: subtle enough not to disappoint someone from Hong Kong. The entree sizes are Asian-sized although I am not a fan of the three dumpling per order for some of the dim sum. The proper number should be four, even if that is an unlucky number in Cantonese.
