A grand restaurant that has kept it's glamor

Date: October 25, 2017
The food scene in San Francisco is ever-changing, with new and inventive spots, shiny chefs and innovation. In the midst of all of this, exists a select few who remain true and solid and delicious. Standing tall for 20 years, hugging one of the corners of Union Square, lives a jewel box with a menu of fresh, bright dishes and wines that will knock you into tomorrow (happily). Seafood is their specialty, but Farallon has wonderful meats and poultry plus a tradition of excellence in the kitchen. When you are in San Francisco, I hope you are fortunate enough to score a table at this glamours restaurant. If you only have a moment on the square, grab a glass of bubbles and fall in love (but don't forget to sneak a peek at dining room to get you excited for your next adventure.

Great start to a wonderful vacation

We were in San Francisco celebrating my wife birthday and decided to try a new restaurant. We chose Farallon at Union Square because it was within walking distance from our hotel. The store front did not prepare us to see the large, well decorated interior.The menu was extensive. Wait staff pleasant and attentive. My wife had scallops for her main dish and I had the short ribs. We were both quite pleased with our choices. We would certainly come again the next time we are in this city.

Another fabulous meal

Appetizers were chowder and scallop sashimi. The scallop was so fresh and tasty. Mains were petrale sole, scallops and braised short beef ribs. All the food was extremely good and you don't see the petrale sole on many menus so that was good fortune. The waiter recommended a local chardonnay which was exquisite with all the meals. The service is really good. Although the restaurant was full, you could still have a conversation. We keep coming back for the seafood, wine and service.

So we hear this place is so great but when I was there it was quiet and just average. The place was quite quiet for a night during the big Oracle convention and so my friend and I sat at the bar. The wine was average and so was our crab appetizer. Don't know if I would go back.

We had a business dinner with 5 people and the restaurant is always a treat. The drinks and oysters were incredible. I did not sample the bread because I'm gluten free, everything but the pasta could be modified for celiacs. We ordered cod and scallops. Both were fantastic and the ratatouille that came with the cod was a little spicy and delicious. The wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable and took care of us very well. There was a mix of business folks, dates and a couple families. The decor is fun, it feels like you are dining on the bottom of the ocean. No dessert, but the wine was excellent!

It kills me to pay $5/oyster and they're so little. I'm spoiled not living here I guess. I could have really gone for a ribeye but will not pay $120 for the privilege. I would like to see some more variety on the menu. I'm a fan of soup and salad before my meal and options there were limited. Yes, that means I'm traditional and boring. Ravioli was really good but portion was "french" i.e., small. Not great for sharing. OK, that's it for negative. The room is great. It feels like old Hollywood going up the curved staircase and the glass fixtures are really something. The service is...well, doting is understating it. Busboy, waiter, manager--all make an appearance within minutes to make sure you're happy. Can't beat that. My seafood and my companion's seafood was all prepared very well, and the sauces on each matched the food and brought out the best. No complaints. Dessert was really good. I had beet sorbet--I love different flavors of ice cream/sorbet/gelato and that qualified! Interesting dessert menu. The cocktail menu is also very unusual, which to me means "good". I like that. They need to carry that over to the dinner menu. I left feeling sated.

We were there for a business dinner. But, if I wanted a special dinner in SF, this is the place. The setting is perfect. Curved ceilings with murals. Incredible wine list. Perfect service. Our waiter knew every bottle of wine and every detail of every dish.I had looked at the website to preview the menu. Everything was different on the actual menu. The menu was still outstanding. The choices are limited, but each is very appealing.One word of caution. Perfection has a high price!

I went with my husband and colleague to this expensive San Francisco restaurant and I had a shocking experience. I chose duck on the menu and after I had eaten my first bite I noticed a SLUG moving on my plate. I have traveled to most places in the world including poor countries in Africa, Morocco,Tunisia, India etc and I have never experienced this before. The female waitress was sympathetic and took the plate away and said the manager would be there to see me soon. BUT he did not come for about 15 minutes and we had to ask for him plus everybody else had finished their meal and I did not have any food. When the manager came he said I had a SLUG on my plate because they had organic food. WHAT !!! The manager said he would replace the food and take the duck off the bill. My husband asked for a free bottle of wine as compensation for my stress,but we were only offered free tiny glasses of dessert wine. I was disgusted by the way I was treated. If this restaurant was in the U.K. It would be CLOSED DOWN because of poor hygienic standards.

We wanted to enjoy a $$$$ level meal to celebrate a special day here in downtown San Francisco. The Farallon's whimsical ocean themed decor instantly transforms the dinner experience into a one that we will fondly remember.I enjoyed an excellent cocktail from their full bar and appreciated the wine suggestions from the sommelier. I liked the oyster platter that sampled three different oysters and the crab stuffed squash blossoms.There were three fish and one seafood entrees to pick from. I enjoyed the earthy flavors from my sturgeon and my wife really liked her scallop dish. There were three meat entrees to select from if for some reason fish/seafood didn't appeal to you in this fish restaurant.Service was outstanding with multiple wait staff swooping in at appropriate moments. So for a memorable SF meal the Farallon is a good choice.

Went here for a quiet business dinner, the local king salmon mi cuit was exceptional, as was the oyster flight with caviar. The rare tuna entree was slightly done for my taste, but I like it rare. The service was perfect, presentation of the dishes was attractive, the decor is over the top, but almost entertaining in a vintage type theme way. The only negative for us was not the venues fault, but two large groups of businessmen were exceedingly loud and raucous during the entire meal, to the point where conversation at our booth was nearly impossible. Since it was a "getting to know you" dinner, it was a bit frustrating. Overall I would very much look forward to going there again sometime when I am back in the city. It was a very unique and interesting experience.

This I believe is one of the finest restaurants in the city., The interior decor is fantastic. It is primarily a seafood restaurant. Does have a meat choice .

We almost always eat at Farallon when we visit SF, at least once or twice a year. This time we were disappointed with some exceptions. The menu is way too limited. I think there were a total of 7 choices of entrees. Too few. Plus some were exotic or extreme so it was very difficult. The waiter was condescending and did not match the usual professionalism I have come to expect. Yet the food was well prepared and enjoyable. Would we rush back? Maybe not. Is it still an excellent restaurant? Yes. 

Overpriced small dinner portions

Great ambience and service! However, dinner portions very small. Ordered the Fruits de mer platter and the Rustic Ratatouille. Seafood was chewy and bland, Ratatouille was delicious. The portion sizes for both entrees were more appropriate for an appetizer. We left hungry after spending close to $200 including tip. Very disappointing experience and would not recommend to anyone seeking a normal sized meal.

We travel to SF annually and usually make a stop at Farallon. Tonight's stop may be our last.1. Menu very limited. Virtually no local fresh fish. We are from the east coast....if I want scallops, I'll have them there. No salmon, no sole. No crab. Limited menu's are fine, but one expects the items to be that much "more special." See # 4.2. Sappy servers that delivered awkward results such as one of the four guests cocktail after the appetizers were served. Rushed appetizers, extraordinarily slow for coffee and desert.3. Appetizers - good. The shrimp cocktail dependable, generous amount of shrimp, fine sauce. Corn chowder ok, but nothing special.4. Entrees - fair to down right unacceptable. Pork chop was raw. Tuna was poor quality (bought, freezer burn) from Australia. Out of our group's four entrees, one was unacceptable, two were poor (tuna and lingcod), and one was "ok" (steak). Sad.

Decor over the top,but works. We had very good pacific coast oysters, picked crab, which was very fresh and generous serve of very high quality and flavour. The lincod, pan fried very good. My wife had the sable fish ( she did find this a little disappointing. Wine list extensive and good. Service very good and professional. Probably a little expensive after choosing a good wine and paying an expected quite large tip by our standards. Overall a good night in an upmarket seafood restaurant

The service was outstanding as was the food. We loved everything we had including: the corn chowder, crab stuffed squash blossoms, pan roasted Lingcod, seared Sablefish, and Raspberry Charlotte for dessert. The ambiance is also wonderful. They do not squeeze you in at this restaurant and I would say that 90% of the tables are quite private. I definitely recommend this spot. I don't think you will be disappointed.

We went to the Farallon for my birthday dinner. We hadn't been there for a while, but I remembered the wonderful fresh sea food platter that we had enjoyed during our previous visit. I was so disappointed when it wasn't on the menu! I mentioned this to our waiter and he said, "no problem, we can do that for you!" And they did! It was even better than I remembered! Made for a perfect celebratory meal!

Went here based on recommendations of friends and food did not disappoint. Having said that while excellent, the options on menu were limited to only 5 fish dishes and 4 poultry/ streak. Appetizer selection was much broader and a good option could be to do 2 appetizers. Sat in balcony area which is nice and quiet but would have preferred to have been given the option to sit in the "sea urchin" chandelier room. Would have given 5th star because as out of turn diners would have enjoyed to sit there- so ask for it.

Honestly, we have experienced 5 Star dining in many large cities in the US, and in Europe and Farallon has ranked as our top favorite! This place is so uniquely decorated, it's romantic and very "under the sea", yet styled with taste. The cocktail lounge is whimsical. Our cocktails were outstanding. Simple, but delicious. We sat in a great booth in the main dining area. We started with a seafood platter of oysters, crab, lobster and added Beluga caviar which we paired with champagne...absolutely delicious. We also tried the stuffed zucchini blossoms...also delicious and delicate. We ordered a great bottle of zin to accompany our seafood entres' as our waitress, Eva suggested. It paired perfectly! I had the sablefish. It was light, but decadent, melted in my mouth like butter. My friends had the scallops, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. My husband's filet was one of the best he's ever had. Perfectly grilled. Unfortunately, we were so stuffed with seafood we skipped dessert, but they all sounded absolutely delightful! Our service was top notch. Our drinks perfect, and our meals were spectacular. Don't miss this beautiful restaurant, it's incredible food and outstanding service!

We chose their 20th Anniversary Special which was a multi course chef selected dinner. We have had tasting menus and chef special dinners at numerous restaurants and this one underwhelmed. It was nice that it include tableside service with every course, however, it primarily consisted of dividing and serving the dish from the single plate it was served on. I most cases it appeared we got a single entree serving which was then divided up among the three of us. Nothing really unique or exciting about any of the dishes. All were well prepared and tasty but in the end it wasn't worth the cost.

I was scrambling to find a nice restaurant for dinner during the intermission of Hamilton. It has been awhile since I have dined at the Farallon so I decided it would be a good place to go to after the show. I was so glad I chose this restaurant because we had a fabulous time. The food was delicious...my scallops were seared just right. My husband ordered the sablefish which was wonderful. They had an extensive wine list and we actually had two bottles of wine for our party of six. Our raspberry dessert looked beautiful and was equally tasty.The service was impeccable and our waiter was very friendly. He told us some of Hamilton cast members have dined at the Farallon a number of times. We truly enjoyed our evening and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.

With a unique interior designed in part with resin, this restaurant provides guests with an intimate fine dining experience. Be aware though that for all the food options available in San Francisco, the Farallon ranks among one of the more expensive picks you can make. If you're looking for the menu in advance, just be advised that the menu is revised frequently to reflect what is fresh and available on a daily basis. So be careful if you're planning on coming here for a particular item, it may no longer be available.

My wife and I visited last weekend. Getting a reservation was not difficult and I was a bit worried about that. But the food and ambiance were both excellent. We started with the cold seafood appetizer - very nice sized lobster claws, a good helping of crabmeat, and some yummy raw oysters and clams (and a few shrimp). My wife opted for a small plate of pan roasted sea scallops in their shells. I had a seared albacore topped with a generous portion of dungeness crab meat. Both were excellent. As I wasn't quite done drinking for the evening, we shared a few large shots of iced vodka - probably not the best value but it went well with the fish and it was all enjoyable. The Jellyfish Lounge in the front of the house looked liked fun, maybe next time we are in town, we'll sit there. And those lighting fixtures are stunning.

Because the Farallon was just around the corner from our hotel, my husband and I stopped by at happy hour to see the decor -- loved the jellyfish suspended from the ceiling. There were tables available, so we stayed and sampled the happy hour menu. We tried the daily oysters (exquisite), abalone chowder, salad, and burger (also outstanding). Plus a draft beer, gimlet, and two glasses of wine. Next time I'll try a Hemingway daiquiri. Food was great, so was the service!

This is an ambient restaurant with nice booths and comfortable, quiet seating.The menu is limited. I had pork tenderloin and my son had the sable fish. My tenderloin was nicely presented but incredibly over salted. It had been brined, but then had a salt finish which was too much. The fish was overly seasoned with soya sauce and ginger which dulled the flavor of the fish. Disappointed and actually surprised that a restaurant of their caliber made these basic errors. Poor cocktails as well, warm martini?

We had some time to kill before a flight back to East coast. We were not excited about getting a lobster roll in California but it surpassed any we ever had in Maine or Massachusetts. No slaw, no mayo, no B.S. Just a great soft roll, plenty of lobster meat, and a heaping helping of melted butter. Heaven. The rest of the raw bar menu was also very good but all the rest was overshadowed by the Lobster Roll. Stop for one or three if you have a minute in San Fran.

Had a booking there on a Friday night but not sure if that was necessary. Their front bar area where the have the Oyster Bar is ok, nothing fancy. The main restaurant itself is pretty nice though. It's set out with an underwater theme, sweeping walls and coral designs. Sounds tacky but it did seem to work. Seafood was all great, tried many different things and the waiter was very helpful and attentive. A little on the expensive side but nice for a treat. Would eat there again which is ultimately what it's all about.

We went here for a business dinner and we're instantly flashed by this nice interior! It is a old pool in art decor style from 1925, were they build a floor o top of the pool. Fantastic ceiling and nice seeing, felt a bit like golden old times. Very good service with most educated waitresses ( food recommendation and worldwide politics...)! Much appreciated as you find that rarely in the city. My seafood creviche with avocado was great and the quail wit foie gras stunning. Sorbets were also great. We had an barrel aged cocktail which was fantastic and great wine. Everybody enjoyed the food, seafood or steak much. A perfect stay and best food at this visit in SFO. But if course you pay that. With 4 people we had over 620$, which is heavy. Compared to other restaurants you still have a money value feeling.

Four of us gathered for an amazing experience. We combined a tasting menu with the recommended wine pairings for a delightful experience. We started out with three different types of oysters on the half shell along with smoked salmon. Then we had abalone chowder which was fantastic. Then we had their octopus appetizer which was incredible. Each of us then had our own entrees which we shared with one another. We had the trout, halibut, and tenderloin/lobster combinations. Then this was followed by an unbelievable desert platter of several different items we all were able to sample. Throughout this extraordinary dining experience we were attended to personally by Jason Ryczek, the executive chef, and Kirstin, our server for the evening. Luke, the wine expert, tended to the pairings of all the wine offerings with each respective course. We were there for almost 5 hours and I've never eaten so much and yet felt so satisfied and not stuffed. Completely an amazing experience we would highly recommend to anyone interested in gourmet food and excellent service.

We did start with the crab as an appetizer which was super fresh and delicious. Great meal!!

My wife and I had the slow, low temperature cooked salmon; it was the best salmon I have ever eaten. Others had beef and other fish dishes, also all prepared to perfection. The wine sommelier was very helpful in finding just the right wine to go with all of our different selections. I have never had more attentive service.

They had a good vine lists and made sophisticated cocktails. We didn't reserve and sat in bar but our barmen was highly professional and made our dinner special. The price for a dinner would be more than 100$ per person but food and atmosphere worth it.

Farallon is a great place to enjoy happy hour at the bar. Great deals but you can still order from the main menu. Food and service are outstanding, it was so good we ate here twice on our 6 day stay. The happy hour oysters with a glass of fizz are a great start to any evening!

Cool place and great seafood

We went there in a large group visiting the area. We got separated tables. That is ok. The food was very good. Nice taste and well prepared. The food arrived quickly also. The atmosphere is elegant and the decorations are cool. You feel at the bottom of the sea eating good seafood. 

Great food and service, one of the best in SF

Farallon is decorated with a strange underwater theme that creates a special but very intimate atmosphere. But don't be fooled the food and wine as well as the service is on a very high level. This is the place you can easily go for a business occasion as well as when you are celebrating a family event or just for a night out. Highly recommended.

Great decor, good food, lovely service

Farallon is just below the SF Playhouse, which makes it a great place to get an early dinner before the curtain. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the food, and also kept us on track to make the show, without in any way making us feel rushed. She did a terrific staff, and while the food is good, it's considered service like this that really stands out.

We chose the Farallon as we were staying on Powell St and saw this had good reviews. It does come in on the pricey side for Bits at the moment but the quality of food and service is outstanding. The dining area is also really attractively decorated adding to the classy feel. There's a great wine selection (Californian Viognier was lovely) and even after an exquisite seafood platter for 2 plus sumptious fresh tuna entrees we still managed to share a wonderful dessert. Go there for something special, it's not cheap, but you'll be impressed.

This is one of the best restauants we visited in San Fransisco.The grilled octopus was first class as was the halibut .Service is excellent and the atmosphere very pleasant. It is however top of the price range so be prepared to pay top dollar.All in all a very good experience 

Outstanding!

Eight of us came to celebrate a special birthday and the whole experience was a wonderful success. We were seated promptly and offered drinks to begin. While the menu favors seafood, our steak-eater thoroughly enjoyed his fillet. While tempted to share the 79oz steak, we decided it would take more than 2 people to eat it and others among us wanted seafood. No one was disappointed; we especially enjoyed the ravioli appetizer and the butter lettuce salad. Finishing the meal with great desserts made the entire evening a great success!

Beautiful decor

No, it's not cheap. Yes, it's worth it. If you're looking for a memorable evening out, Farallon is for you. The ambiance is amazing: decorating a restaurant like an aquarium seems like a premise that could so easily have veered into the depths of cheesiness. Farallon, however, is stunningly beautiful inside. The food is pricey, no doubt, but the whole experience is worth it.

Very interesting interior, the food was excellent, but hard to find on your plate due to such a petite portion.

Very expensive, Short pour on the wine, at least 8 glasses a bottle, food was good, service was good, interior interesting, but plan to stop at another restaurant on the way home to get something to eat, due to the minuscule portions.

If you ever thought of an underwater kingdom - this is it. The first space by the entrance is a bar zone with octopus shaped lamps. We had to wait for our table to get ready, so we spent some time at the bar. The barman was very friendly. We were not sure about the wine, so he kindly suggested us to taste few options to make a choice. The main hall is different. With its vaulted ceiling and thick walls, which stop wifi signal, it reminds more of Russian XVth century chambers. Deemed light makes you feel relaxed, especially appropriate for the dinner time. The menu was not big, but the selection of sea food dishes was good, all we had was pretty tasty. The only thing that bothered us was the inside temperature. For the chilly weather in February it was quite cold inside.

Excellent Oysters!

We had a great trime at Farallon. It is good for a romantic diner or fine diner. I would not recommend this restaurant for family with young kids or teenagers. They do update their menu everyday. It is also great to see the chef cooking for you as the kitchen is opened to the dining room. They also have a raw bar. The wine was excellent. great selection of wines, including French. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The service was very professional, but not outstanding as they were not really friendly (no smile !This is just about food, relax).The wine and food were very expensive though, and we did not have caviar! Oysters were fresh. Their champagne sauce delicious.The amuse bouches were unnecessary...nothing exceptional (small spoon of mascarpone and seaweeds) The entrees were very good but not out of this world. The desserts good, but nothing incredible. Overall it is a great restaurant. I will recommend it, but it's more for the experience than for the food.

I do not really want to give a negative review to Farallon, but it was made out to be better than it actually was by everyone I spoke to.The setting and decor was fantastic and the atmosphere great, as was the staff. The food, in my opinion was mediocre and I was a bit disappointed. I feel I have to be honest with you on that, I was also disappointed with their wine menu, again maybe its just me. We were looked after and the setting was nice.

After reading some former reviews I had lowered my expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. Saturday night is very busy but the staff at Farallon were up for the challenge! As soon as we sat down we were greeted by the waiter and soon after that a sommelier came over to help us with our wine choice. Throughout the night we were never waiting for wine or water to be topped up, friendly inquiries from staff making sure we had our needs met. The waiter was very informed on gluten free choices as well. We started with some oysters which were lovely and local. Then we had a lyonnaise salad which matched the bitter of the greens with a very nice dressing and fresh wonderful bacon to top it off. I had the abalone chowder with Yukon gold potato which was elegantly flavoured, nice and light despite the creamy base. The main entrees we had were halibut and Maine lobster and sablefish. The halibut came with grits which were light and creamy and a sauce which was just okay. The fish was all done to perfection but both dishes flavours were slightly underwhelming. Overall though, we were very impressed with the service and effort and had a wonderful meal. Get a seat by the kitchen and watch the tremendous execution in a very busy restaurant!

Delicious!

We had an awesome dinner at the enchanting Farallon. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with comfortable, spacious seating. The menu changes frequently to accommodate the freshest fish and produce available and everything tastes amazing! We enjoyed the English Pea Ravioli, Cayucos Abalone Chowder, Sablefish and the best Trout I have ever tasted. Everything was prepared with great attention to detail. The service is outstanding and although the restaurant was very busy we were never rushed. Pricey but so worth a visit.

Over Priced and Seafood wasn't fresh

Beautiful venue but that's where it pretty much ended. We ordered a huge fresh raw bar platter and the food was not fresh. Oysters were almost sour and fishy tasting. Lobster tails were under cooked. Shrimp was OK though. Very disappointing experience for my bithday. My wife told the staff it was my birthday and they presented 3 Marshmellows and a candle. At though prices you would have thought they would at least offer a slice of cake. The service was good and when we pointed out that the food wasn't fresh they lowered our bill somewhat. We don't think we will return and we live in the SF Bay area.

Love the Jellyfish bar

The decor is wonderful worth just going for a look at the fabulous jellyfish glass lighting. Had the cold platter with crayfish, crab and prawns and we combined it with a plate of oysters. They have a range of oysters from 8 different regions. Combined with a glass of bubbles and a crisp Samosa white not bad. It was interesting to try the different tastes of flesh for each and the oysters being so varied to Australian seafood, different but delicious. All a bit of fun.

Not all its made out to be. We asked the front desk attendant for a recommendation on a good seafood place and she recommended the Farallon. When you walk in you'll notice a unique decor that might distract you from the obvious. The obvious being the the standard service. Although this might not sound that bad you might want to think twice once you see the pricing. I'm not at all opposed to paying top dollar when the food and service are spectacular, which this wasn't. If you're looking for a decent meal with under whelming service and over extended wait times for your dinner than this is the place for you. When you receive your meals they are prepared as ordered, or at least we did. The manager also seemed to care and apologized but the server blamed the order on a miscommunication. I hope our experience was a fluke but if anyone out there decides to visit this establishment dine at your own risk.

Come On??!!

The ambience and services were good. The food was very over priced and the portions were ridiculously small. In addition, it was far from superior. Pretty much average.We laughed when it served.We eat in New Orleans & Minneapolis regularly and this place would not be open there.

Return visit. Raw bar appetizer platter is quite incredible. The oysters were among the best I have ever had. Recommend getting the big platter if you are hungry and sharing. Crudo was awesome. Octopus appetizer was not special. Broccoli rabe very tasty. It's expensive. Cheese board for dessert was tasty.

While most of the ingredients were of excellent quality, they were not combined well. The chef's take on prawn cocktail was the worst we have ever experienced - naked prawns with a dish of overwhelming fruit sauce. Worst dish was lamb - raw in the middle, panisse peas cold on edge, lukewarm at side, cold mushrooms, good polenta fingers - felt like the dish had been assembled individually, at too long an intervals, then dumped on the plate. Steak was of excellent quality, but spoilt by sides of huge battered onion rings (take out food style) , beetroot and cheese - none of which blended happily together or with the steak. Tried to tell the waiter how disappointed we were - but he did not respond. Finally he walked away and bought us all the uneaten food carefully packed to take away! Nobody seemed interested in us. We left the exact amount of the large bill and walked out without tipping.

The decor catches you immediately. Jelly fish lights hang in the lounge above the raw bar. Amazing! The dining room is like an clamshell. Semi-circular booths line the perimeter. Service was superb. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. We enjoyed the large cold seafood sampler - a three tiered affair. A limited menu, but what's on it is well prepared. Dessert very yummy. A charming evening.

The bartender at the Chancellor Hotel recommended Farallon.Since it was just around the corner,we decided to give it a try. We were impressed by how beautiful the restaurant is.We sat in the bar and had 3 appetizers and 2 desserts.Everything we tasted was wonderful.We started with the Cayucos Abalone Chowder, a sentimental choice since my family used to vacation in Cayucos and ate abalone when it was bountiful and inexpensive.That was long,long ago.We loved everything we ordered.The server was helpful in explaining the dishes we asked about.Next trip to San Francisco this would be my choice for a return visit.

Interesting decor, great waiter but poor food. Salad Lyonaise was excellent, tortellini broth was salty and had 1 1/2 tortellini. Waited an hour for sturgeon and it was beautiful, large portion but raw. Sent it back and the portion was 1/3 the size and undercooked. Came because of high tripadvisor rating but will not return.

We really stopped in to see the fantastic decor of sea life; decorated with different levels of the sea in mind. The jellyfish lights are lovely and makes the place unique.

Farallon is a really upscale seafood restaurant near Union Square and upscale usually means a high price tag. Not during Happy Hour - they have great drinks for $5-$7 and appetizers for $7. We got the fish and chips and the six oysters, both were delicious. The seafood was so fresh. If you're on a budget and want great dining - definitely go to Farallon during Happy Hour!

As a San Franciscan, I recently re-discovered Farallon and it continues to earn its reputation with great service and food. Its the kind of place for a special night out of romance, located near ACT and the Curran which now will make it one of our 'go to' places for theater. I had previously thought of it as a place more for business meals (which many people do use it for) but have added it to my list of favorite SF restaurants because of the beautiful food and excellent service.

Every year, I am in San Fran for one week. The one place I always return to is Farallon, for its exceptional food quality, the finest professionalism of ALL the staff and the beautiful environment of the restaurant. In the five years that I have had the privilege of eating there, I have never had a bad dish!Beginning with bar, with its knowledgeable and friendly bartenders (e.g., Austin) and wide selection of scotch, I could not be happier.In the dinning department, any seafood you order is an absolute guarantee to be delicious. The fish is always prepared with wonderful accompanying flavors and side dishes. The pasta is fresh and teaming with wonderful additions (I love those mushrooms!). Each and every one of the servers is epitome of the finest server.As I mentioned, I come every year...I make sure to eat here on the last day of my visit - so not to spoil it for all the other dining I am doing for the week!
