Had to try Molinari when I read all of the reviews. We all ended up ordering the Italian special (from an Italian deli, it seemed like the right thing to do). Everyone enjoyed their sandwich. I'm relatively new to enjoying Italian style sandwiches, so maybe it's me, but I didn't find the sandwich or meats rant-worthy. They were good, definitely above average, but not to die for.I expected a line out the door, but the wait wasn't too bad. They did have a bit of a chaotic atmosphere as everyone took a number, and if you wanted a sandwich, you grabbed your own bread from a case in the corner. There was no real line or clear order to the setup, but the staff were very friendly and helpful.I do not understand the complaints about high prices. Everything, sandwiches and meats, seemed reasonably priced. We could have even shared sandwiches, as it turns out, as they were quite hardy.

All the ingredients Italiano you could ever want for cooking Italian except the meat and poultry. The cheese! Sausages! Hams! The ravioli and tortellini to take home and make your own super dish! Sandwiches are made to order with the ingredients you choose. Take it to the nearby park (just ask for directions) and you'll have an authentic San Francisco lunch at resident, not tourist, prices.

One of these days we will get a sandwich here1

We stop here every time we go to SF. We love this deIi! I also get the salames and cheeses for gifts. Be sure to carry on the salame to your plane and show it to TSA, as it resembles explosives and they will pull your suitcase. This is a not to be missed stop. By the way, they have the real Italian cherries for Manhattans here. My hubby loves that! Had to make a trip to mail them back. Sure wish we had a deli this good near me.

You will find many good Italian comestibles here, cheese, wine, and prepared items. It's where we get baccala (salt cod). Generally it's a good stop, but prices are high. Sometimes they have great specials. However, the big problem is people ordering sandwiches. The line and wait is a nuisance. They need to reconfigure to serve the sandwich crowd and deli shoppers.

This is not just a deli - it's a whole incredible experience.

You definitely want to put this place on your North Beach / San Francisco to-do list.

If you want to experience North Beach midday, stop by Molinari's for a sandwich. Take a number when you go in, then you can browse the shop while you wait.

Good neighborhood Italian deli where you can buy fresh home made pasta, sauces, salami, etc. Italian cookies, cheeses, wines.However more importantly they craft a great sandwich on your choice of fresh rolls, my favorite is The mozzarella cheese with pesto, peppers and the like. Have taken it on planes and my seat mates are always very interested.Not expensive, great place but not really a restaurant. There are seats outside but mostly people come to buy and take out to cook, etc.Buy something and eat at the park near St Peters and Pauls in North Beach.

Thanks to Ta we decided to take a sandwich from Molinari.As soon as the door goes, it seems to enter an Italian supermarket, cheeses and hams on the counter, Italian products on the shelves.There are so many people at lunchtime, so you have to make the queue by taking the number.You can make the sandwich as you like and it's really great.The managers are Italian Americans so you can speak a bit of Italian.Being Italians also made us a small discount.Delicious sandwiches and fill so much.I would recommend this place if you want to eat a sandwich sitting on a meadow with the wonderful view of SFAlessandro

We both had the chicken parmigiana sandwich. The sandwiches were big and good. If your not real hungry I recommend sharing one. It's a small place so the waiting is awkward. Every where you stand you feel like your in the way. Very little seating so plan to take it home or to a park to eat. I have to add that the making of the sandwiches is done without gloves. Plus when you get your bread out of the bin your just holding it with dirty hands waiting to hand it over for a sandwich to be made. Too many microbiology classes to eat there again. Even though the sandwich was good I wouldn't go back.

You can't go to SF without visiting Molinari's Deli for a sandwich. Rightfully named as 'The Best' Deli (and indeed consistently named in the top handful of all eatery types in the city). Sandwiches are legendary, chose from the suggested favourites or have a one made up to your own desire. Simple highest quality ingredients, well packed sandwiches, friendly service. Try the North Beach Special (if I tell you what's in it your imagination will fall way short of how good it is !)

You can't escape the awesome aromas escaping onto Columbus street acting like a magnet dragging you inside this Italian deli. Inside one feels as if he/she had been delivered into some sort of culinary heaven. Every imaginable digestible treat known to humankind can be found. Cold cuts, cheeses, breads, pastas and a plethora of desserts call out to you making it impossible to leave the store without treating yourself to what seems like an early Christmas present. Tourists leave crying and mumbling to themselves that it is not fair that every neighborhood doesn't have a Molinari's

To eat like a local, first PULL A NUMBER from the red box by the door so you know your place in line. Then PICK OUT YOUR OWN BREAD from the bread box so you can hand it to the deli folks who will make your sandwich. The authentic Italian cold cuts, condiments and cheeses are sliced fresh while you wait and assembled in generous proportions as you request, or you can choose one of their suggested combinations (including hot sandwiches like chicken parm or meatball).They offer about 4 small tables, all of which are on the sidewalk, so you may need to take your sandwich elsewhere or eat standing up. They also have take-and-bake pastas and a selection of Italian grocery items, cheeses and salamis.

An old time style eatery/Italian store like it was many years ago. I can imagine it's been past down from generation to generation...that is the feel of the place. Not only tourists were there but many locals were customers. Had the Italian sandwich...they put mustard on it. My only suggestion is if you're going to order the Italian sandwich, have them drizzle olive oil on it instead of mustard. Pick your own bread from the bread bin...didn't see any thin Italian bread in the bin on my visit.....sad face.

They have great sandwiches and the people here are so very nice and warm. It's easy and fun to splurge here, from olive oil, pasta , cookies, salami, chocolates, olive spread, name it they have it. all made in Italy, I love their anchovies here and homemade ravioli. For some reason about a year ago in one of the radio station reported that this store was closing. So when my husband got a chance to ask them in one of our visit if they are indeed closing the store. They answered flatly that the news was fake. How awful of that person spreading lies. Not cool at all. Anyway. I can't wait for our next visit.

Old School Italian deli in North Beach. Solid sandwich(#2 on my favorite Italian deli subs in California). I think it's always busy and the ordering system is a bit odd, take a #, chose your bread, decide on the sando(I had the Molinari combo), place order. Once they call your # the sandwich comes quick thanks to the pros behind the counter. The piece of bread you chose looks small at first, but once the load on your toppings it's a huge sub!

Prices have changed and are now over 10$ each. Good old fashioned deli. Good service but make sure to take a number. Their bread is precut, in a box for sandwiches, but none are labeled. I grabbed what I thought was wheat, and it was regular. Didn't want to put it back so I wasn't exactly happy about that. Subs are about 8 inches. Meats and cheeses are high quality. Bread is average. Prices need updated. Seems most of San Francisco charges about $10-12 for any sandwich/burger with no sides. May return, but want better value for a simple sandwich.

There were three of us so we had three sandwiches including the North Beach (Prosciutto and Sundries Tomatoes), mortadella and provolone, and the Molinari special (mixed meats and provolone). I'd recommend ordering everything on the sandwich which includes homemade peperoncini, mustard, lettuce and olive oil and vinegar which is excellent.

You must first pick your bread type from a bin on your side of the counter then hand it to the clerk and tell him what kind of sandwich you want him to make and what types of extras you want on it. The selection of sandwich types are many. Remember to get a number from the ticket machine when you walk in since the line might be long. A must eatery.

This was a must stop for me during my wife's & my recent trip to SF. I had seen it on "The Layover" and also noticed the high rankings on TripAdvisor (#3 at the time). So one rain soaked early afternoon my wife & I trekked our way from our Union Square hotel through Chinatown just to eat here.We love cured meats & cheeses but admit we were a little out of our element and comfort zone. We didn't know exactly what to order so we asked the young gentleman behind the counter for his advice. He ran through a rehearsed sandwich selection with a thick accent that was difficult to understand. When we asked him follow up questions he kinda seemed annoyed and not very helpful. Finally my wife & I just rolled the dice, picked a couple of items from their sandwich menu board and hoped for the best. However while we were deciding he went to help others at the counter and some young lady took over our orders and also seemed annoyed with us when we asked her some questions. Sorry! First timers here & doing our best.When we finally got our sandwiches we decided to take them to our hotel and eat them there. When we did they were fantastic! I don't know which one we liked best but they were both equally good! Wish I could tell you what we had but I cant. All that I can say is it had meat, cheese, lettuce & other stuff on it.....did I mention it was good?Our only complaint was the staff, not only for the pre-described reasons but while we were there I also had the audacity to ask to use their restroom. Yes, I saw the sign saying that customers are not allowed to use their restrooms but sorry, by building code they are required to provide restrooms for their customers. I wouldn't normally push the issue but as mentioned we had walked quite a way in the pouring rain just to eat here and it was an emergency! It was either that or go in the street which I really didn't want to do. I didn't think using their toilet was too much to ask. Well, apparently I was wrong! Some old timer behind the counter (I'm guessing the Owner) got very cranky with me explaining why I can't use their restroom. I responded with "Hey! We walked a long way in the pouring rain just to eat here, it's pouring rain right now, it's not like we're not buying anything, I just need to pee but fine...whatever!" We really try not to be those spoiled American tourists when we travel. We travel often and I don't feel that we are but with the attitude that we had already received I was in no mood for any additional cr@p from them! A few minutes later he told me to come over and walked me to the restroom.I get why he didn't want me to use it as we walked through a number of back kitchens just to get there and when I did it was tiny. He had sanitary concerns with customers using their bathroom but again I gotta say "building code!" Alas I got to do my thing, I told him that I was very appreciative and all was well. Just letting you guys not to expect the same courtesy! If it had been more crowded I'm sure I'd be out of luck. I guess they're just not used to serving people that don't know the drill which we obviously didn't. As titled it had a very "Soup Nazi" like atmosphere so I guess that makes me Newman since I would probably go back the next time I'm in town. The quality of their sandwiches were just to good. We'll just be sure to do our homework next time and use the restroom before we get there!!! You have been warned!

The service was quick but of the highest quality. Genuine Italian taste, reasonable prices. We got two sandwiches and it was enough for two meals

This is an old school North Beach deli. Unchanged despite the passage of time. It is like a living time capsule. A delicious one! Generous sandwiches with choice meats. Pro tip: look online, get hungry, and order for pick up before getting there. There usually is a line, and you don't want to wait longer than necessary. There is limited seating, but the tables out front are great for people watching, or take your treasure to Washington Square park where the people watching is also good, but more languid.

This is old school North Beach Italian Deli at its best.

As a child we would always stop at Molinari's when we were in North Beach picking up things for holidays and family celebrations. Then as an adult I bartended in North Beach and would always stop in. Now I don't go as often but when I do I am transported back to my youth. It is still good and the food hasn't changed. And there is that old little bakery around the corner. Yummy.

What would North Beach be without Molinari Deli?

It is The Italian deli !. If you want the best Italian hero's, sandwich's and hot takeout food this IS the place. Shop for hard to find Italian dry goods, can and jar foods.Cold cuts and cheese add to the list. Great breads. This place is a SF institution and adds to the North Beach experience.

I love this place. Best salami I ever ate. But beware, this is NOT a restaurant, its a delicatessen.

Having grown up and lived in Philadelphia and New York (nothing against any other city), but both of those cities have their share of delicious Italian delis. This place is right up there!

Shared a sandwich with my friend, big enough to share, fresh toppings, great flavors. Friendly staff. They have a few tables on the street to stay and eat or you can take away. Good value.

I love stopping here. Such a great variety of Italian meats, cheeses, olives, etc...everything there is to love. Of course we purchased a log of salame which did not disappoint. We knew we were coming here after lunch, and although we've had awesome sandwiches here before on a food tour of North Beach in the past, we decided to pick up a few small things we could take back to the hotel and have as our own antipasti creations. So after picking up a loaf of Boudin sourdough (we had the people at Boudin slice it for us) in Fisherman's Wharf, we headed directly for Molinari's and ordered garlic stuffed olives, marinated artichoke hearts, toscano (mild - a garlicky, thinly sliced salame), the chewy Italian candies they have in the giant jars on the counter, and also picked up small bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (they even had one with a spray nozzle, which worked out perfectly). We paired this with a great bottle of moscato and some cookies from Stella Pastry up the street. It was a wonderful way to eat in at our hotel room when it got rainy and we wanted to hunker down and get cozy after a long day of walking...especially knowing we were coming back home to the North Bay with leftover yummies the next day.When you walk in, don't forget to take a number so you don't end up waiting and getting skipped. I have heard people say that when it's busy here, don't lollygag...when your number gets called, you better know what you want already! So we took that to heart and didn't hesitate to list all the stuff we wanted when asked. We felt like the gentleman helping us was friendly and patient with us throughout. Wished we had ordered more goodies to bring home and try, but alas we did not...and they are closed on Sundays, so we will have to plan another trip to North Beach to visit here again. :)

Great Italian deli in North Beach.

Been coming to Molinaris for last few years , when visiting San Francisco.This place is an authentic Italian deli from Salami's to cheeses to all kinds of fresh salads.Never disappointed by any sandwich I've had.There's a system for ordering, first take red ticket then proceed to bread box choose bread,when number is called order sandwich. I always get a sandwich for the plane ride home.Always delicious.

Molinari's is not only great, but it is a piece of Italian/American history that will soon be gone from our landscape.Italian delis were everywhere when I grew up in Detroit, but now they are a rarity.Molinari's represents the character of what once was more common so be sure to stop in and enjoy what it is and what it preserves from our past.

Their Italian sandwiches are great. I really liked their sausages too. You are able to get them at the store. It last a very long time, the sausage I mean.

I have always loved going here for most of my life. My Father was friends with the Molinari's many years ago. This family run business produces some of my most favorite meats and Salami's. Those goes my mouth watering just writing about it!!!!.

Great selection of Italian Deli items and cold cuts. The lunch sandwiches made to order are worth the visit. The foccacia is great whether they make it there or elsewhere. Always helpful counter people; just ask
