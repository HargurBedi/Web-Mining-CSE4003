I just loved this restaurant. I dream of it. I think I'll visit the city just to go here again. I had an incredible experience here - it was later in the evening, exhausted solo business day travel, and I found myself in Castro. I fell in love with this restaurant. The food is incredible - I was slightly disappointed that I was by myself and not able to enjoy more items on the menu. I had the chowder, and the caesar salad (omg it's huge). It's a small, quaint restaurant with so much charm, great service, and such good food. Be prepared to wait, myself solo, at 830pm on a Monday night had to wait. However - it is well worth the wait. 

Well Worth the Trip!

Was very excited to visit this restaurant. Had read the amazing reviews, and was aware of their Michelin star...... Maybe I was expecting too much? Don't get me wrong. It was a very good meal, but it wasn't great!We showed up around 4:40 on a Friday ..... yes it was early, but we wanted to avoid the huge lineups plus we had a very early flight back home the following morning.From beginning to end we were seated for only 35 minutes. It was one of the most rushed meals we have ever had. The Caesar salad ( which was super tasty ) had barely been attacked when they brought out the soup. We started eating the soup.... then they brought out the mains. At one point all three dishes were on the table, unfinished! I joked with the waitress that they seemed to want to get rid of us. She laughed and mentioned that the lunch time staff were getting ready to go.......yeah......not a good excuse!And that doesn't explain why we weren't offered the dinner menu, which was displayed at 5pm and definitely had more options, and looked very good.we realized afterward that we most likely ordered from the limited lunch menu...... oh well.My crab cake main was probably some of the best crab cakes I've had. My partners prawns were overcooked. The oysters rocked, but the clam chowder was almost flavourless.....too much cream, not enough everything else.If I come back to SF, I may give them another chance....maybe....But we definitely left feeling slightly disappointed.

Visited tonight for dinner. Had to wait a while for dinner. Put our names down on the board, went for a couple of drinks at a nearby bar and came back an hour later to then being nearly to the top of the list. Waited 10mins and then had a seat at the bar. Menu is small but well formed. We shared the special starter. Oysters were great, as were the prawns and the clams. Clam chowder and green lip mussels for main which again were both great. Not sure if mussels were a little over cooked are just so meaty as they were so big. Nice friendly service. Great little spot. Certainly worth going.

Ok, this is not Waterbar or Tadich Grill. It's a tiny neighborhood seafood joint in the heart of The Castro w a charming interior, cool stainless steel tables and a chalkboard menu. If you manage to snag a window table you'll experience one of the most diverse sidewalk 'shows' anywhere in the world. Straight, gay, drag queens, couples (of ALL types) pushing baby carriages and the occasional almost naked person. (If you don't appreciate this sort of diversity perhaps you should instead head to the Cheesecake Factory on Union Square or Applebees at Fishermans Wharf.)No reservations so plan on a wait. Also, don't expect a multi page menu. They only offer one or two fresh fish options, depending on the catch of the day and several regular items like chowder, shrimp, crab, oysters, a couple salads and great sourdough bread. But...what they serve is simply perfect. You can't get better anywhere else.

Anchor Oyster Bar has been around for over forty years for good reason, the Seafood is amazing and fresh.It's not an easy spot to find as it is a long way down Market and then up Castro but the journey will be rewarded.We had the Crab Cakes,Wild Prawns and Clam Chowder with a side of garlic bread. The crab cakes are moist and full of flavor, the Wild Prawns taste like they jumped right out of the ocean and into a buttery pan before landing in your mouth. The Clam Chowder is creamy and bursting with delicious aroma and flavor. The garlic bread is the best I have ever had gooing with goodness and deserves recognition.If you want fresh seafood and great service this is the place for you.

Luckily i only required a romantic table for one so i was seated immediately at the bar and had a pint of beer within a couple of minutes.The service was some of the best I've ever experienced where the knowledgeable polite staff seemed to genuinely care about my experience.The food was delicious and of a good size, I had a selection of oysters and a sort of seafood tomato soup. I don't know if it was intentional but after greatly enjoying the two king crab legs on the top i was astonished and pleasantly surprised to find a third one lurking in the depths of my soup.Hats off to you, I look forward to my next visit.

This establishment has been here for several decades. The owner has direct connections to the families founding the legendary restaurants at Fisherman's Warf. Her dedication and immense pleasure of serving has a chalk board waiting for you to sign up. A small counter and six tables make up this gem. They may even make you the special seafood pasta if you ask nicely. (Not on the menu most days.) Anchor Oyster Bar recently received a Michelin Star.

Visited Anchor Oyster Bar based on the TripAdvisor reviews and they were spot on. I went early (got there around 5:30) and was seated very shortly thereafter. I sat at the small bar and a patron next to me (a regular) suggested I order the Cioppino, a sort of fish stew with enormous prawns, mussels, clams, fish and crab legs in a an exellent broth. Great garlic bread comes with it to sop up the delicious flavor. I also had an order of the oysters, and they were outstanding -- so fresh as if they were just plucked from the sea. The food is not cheap but you certainly came away from there satisfied and having had a fabulous seafood feast. Definitely recommend.

This is absolutely the Best meal I have ever had. This small restaurant only has six tables and a counter that seats eight. We had to wait an hour outside in the cold and the wait was well worth it,. I had a cup of the most amazing scrumptious and silky clam chowder to start. My next course was steamed mussels in a very garlic butter and wine sauce. I had a delicious of loaf of sourdough bread to soak up all the sauce. The main course was crab cakes with roasted potato. It was a homerun and I loved the dill tartar sauce. What an amazing place and the service was outstanding

Thanks for the recommendation TripAdvisor! We were looking for an authentic SF food experience and were not disappointed. Putting our group name on the whiteboard and only waited 10 minutes to be seated. We were fortunate to be the last table in for the night as there are only limited number of seats in this unique little restaurant. The famous Ciopinno was fabulous, fresh and the best fun to share. The Day's special was seafood linguine with the most delicious creamy tomato based sauce that dance in your mouth. The prawns were crunchy and the clams and mussels perfectly cooked with a good portion of pasta robed in this incredible sauce that was too yummy to leave any on the plate. Too full and too late for dessert, but sure would have been nice too. Go, it is well worth the wait.

On the third day, we showed up before 6, and were rewarded with a table in 15 minutes, It was worth the wait. You must try the mussels.the crab cakes, and the clam chowder.

My husband and I arrived in San Francisco in the late evening, and we were starving! I had done some restaurant research and we decided to give Anchor Oyster Bar a try after seeing such great reviews. We arrived at the restaurant around 9 pm on a Thursday. This was a GREAT time to go as no one was waiting ahead of us! (I can understand why there is normally a line as the food is delicious and the restaurant is so small.) We ordered the crab cake entree with clam chowder and the smaller serving of cioppino. I don't think any clam chowder can ever compare (I normally don't even like clam chowder), and the cioppino was out of this world and such a unique dish that we cannot get anywhere near us. (Note: the crab cakes were good but I would not order them again over the cioppino or clam chowder.) The service was good, and we never wanted for beverage refills or more bread! There was a lot of diversity among the restaurant patrons, and the ambiance was so welcoming and warm, which we appreciated. I am so glad we picked Anchor Oyster Bar as our first meal - it was an amazing introduction to the city. This was easily the best meal we had on our trip, and we would highly recommend it.

What a treasure! Even though the line was out the door, it was fast moving and by the time I reached the counter I just had enough time to review the extensive menu. The food was across the board fresh snd perfectly prepared. The "lobster special" wascomparable to seafood I have had in New England. The proximity to my motel and the airport made it a convenient and delicious dinner stop.

Love sitting at the bar for some of the freshest seafood in San Francisco. Excellent wine menu to go with both cooked and raw but they also have a corkage fee if you want to bring a bottle fo your favorite bottle. Be prepared to wait in line, it's well worth it.Menu favorites include the Greenlip mussels and the Cracked Dungeness Crab (out of this world). Been multiple times now, never a bad experience.

(See Photos attached).The Scallops were big and juicy.The long bar dinning is fun for one or two, the staff will combine tables for a group. However, I'd recommend this is not a place if you have a really large group of more than 7 or 8 people if you all want to be close.TIP: When you arrive (NO RESERVATIONS ACCEPTED), write your name on the cute whiteboard outside the restaurant and specify how many dinners. In democratic fashion dinners are seated in order as seating allows.Plus the high turnover means you'll have 3 or more servings per evening.

Terrific tiny seafood restaurant in Castro neighborhood. 6 tables + counter seating only. Hubby had Mexican prawn entree. Delicious, plump prawns served with thick potato wedges & roasted heirloom carrots. I had the fresh crabmeat salad which was chock full of crabmeat (from northern Washington) throughout the salad, not just on top. Not cheap, but worth the price. Good to go on a warm, sunny day when you can sit outside & people watch while waiting for a table or seat at the counter.

Anchor Oyster Bar. Going there is an experience. I recommend you to go there very early (19.00) or very late (21.00) to avoid the queue. Anchor Oyster Bar is a little spot situated in Castro street.

I love AOB it's a great seafood place, great staff but quite small! the whole place maybe seats maybe 30 people. With the long wait you have to come prepared for san francisco style eating. This isn't some big chain. So plan for what time you will be hungry, arrive an hour before then and put your name on the board. You could be waiting 45-1.5 hours depending on day and time. It's not a restaurant for children IMO so find a babysitter. Of course enjoy the amazing food.

We were in SF 4 nights...2 were spent here at the Anchor. The cioppino was amazing with huge chunks of fish, ample crab and jumbo shrimp that deserve the name jumbo. The crab either way is fantastic and they have one of the best clam chowders I've ever had. So light and creamy, it just dances along the tongue. The crab cakes were also full of crab instead of the usual filler. We waited almost an hour to get in. You write your name on the board outside with the number of people and time you arrived and you better be there when they call your name or they are on to the next name. Bring a jacket if it's evening because waiting on the hill can be very chilly after 15 minutes. The first night it did take extraordinary long to have our orders taken and then brought out. It was a Saturday and the kitchen looked short-handed. Monday night it was a much shorter wait and much quicker service. So best to try and week night to avoid the wait, if you can. But go. Avoid the tourist traps and journey into the Castro where you'll get great neighborhood seafood.

The clam chowder was good, probably the third best chowder I've ever had. Overall worth checking out...

A small restaurant with just a hand full of tables and a bar area, so get there early if not wanting to queue. Lovely waitresses will take your order and more then likely if you order oysters will then go shuck them personally for you. The oysters here are amazing and are shipped in from various locations around Canada and the U.S. Trust me when I say these could be the freshest and most delicious I have ever had. We both had the seafood salads for mains. Although delicious could have used a more tastier sauce. Still didn't distract from the fact this a very cool popular restaurant with great food and lovely staff.

What a terrific find. Off the beaten path on Castro Street. No reservations but worth the wait, even in the rain. Extremely courteous staff. Small selection of beer and wine but items pair well with the entres. Fresh oysters are great. We tried the ceasar salad, plain. Delicious ceasar dressing. The shrimp with roasted veggies was fantastic. We shared the entres otherwise we would have been totally stuffed. The staff is welcoming and the service was top notch. Very limited seating and hats off to the chef for turning out such terrific meals from the tiny galley. Better than a Michelin star!

Currently my favourite restaurant in San Francisco. This small and inviting seafood bistro is so popular that you will almost have to queue to get a table at busy times, but its well worth it. The queuing system is unique - put your name on the board outside, then hop across the road to the fab little wine bar for a drink or two, then get back in the queue and enjoy a free cup of chowder or nibbles while you wait.Once inside the atmosphere is buzzy and bustling. Enjoy the wonderful cioppino, great salads and grilled fish.

Best Cioppino ever. Garlic bread is from Heaven. Wine bar across street is perfect place to wait. It's Tiny and your write your name on the whiteboard and better be sure you are there when the tiny man called your name. But it is worth it. Amazing.

The fish is fresh and well done up. Seafood soup is with fish and very flavorful. The freshness, preparation of the food and the low-key atmosphere were the best. Everything we tried was excellent.Just really enjoyed ourselves. Really recommend this place if you love seafood. A must visit.

FABULOUS!!

This was a long wait in line to eat. It might have just been the time of day we showed up to eat. The food and service was spot on and I was very impressed with this place for sure. I will go back but it will be at an odd time to miss the crowd.

Freaky good stuff

The place is a bit off from the city but it's nice and clean. However it is quite small, and parking can be tough. It sits only 21-22 people at one time. Any party greater then 4, will likely require separate tables. DO NOT GO DURING LUNCH OR DINNER TIME. Unless you are one of the first there and is extremely lucky, this restaurant is a nice sit down, savor your food kinda restaurant, thus most on the patrons will be there for at least 1 hr or more. It is debatable if one should arrive there hungry or not. If you get there hungry, you will be famish by the time you are seated. However you will be rewarded with the selection on the menu. Although the menu is limited, one would be tempted to try everything on the menu. I was only able to try a third of what was on the menu. I was impressed with everything they served, especially their clam chowder. the crab burger was a bit misleading, they should have just called it a crab sandwich if you get my drift. Overall it was a nice experience, but only seafood lovers would have the greatest appreciation. 

Locals clam chowder!

Small restaurant on Castro Street is a wonderful find. Fish is super fresh and the Boston style clam chowder is really good. Gets busy about 5:30 so be prepared for a wait.

I first ate here decades ago with a good friend. I was back in town and wondered if it was still as good as my memory. It was actually better! No reservations but you sign up on a list outside the door. The number of tables and seats at the bar are very limited but they work people in and out very efficiently. While waiting outside they even came out and offered garlic bread to keep us engaged. Once inside the food is fantastic. Great oysters, chowder, salads, bread, etc. I sat at the bar and marveled at how well the operation was run. Continuous busing of plates, washing, serving, etc. All done in precision fashion. Very impressive. Friendly staff and great food at a great price. Highly recommended!

I came here for late... Really late lunch. I order half a docen of assorted oysters, clam chowder and an open face sandwich.I order the chowder cause of the other reviews here. It was good but not great, so I was expecting the rest od the food was the same. The oyaters were of course very fresh and tasty. Then the sandwich came OMG! That thing was awesome! Absolutely delicious. Will be back for one of those each and every time I'm in town.Unpretentious, inexpensive, amazing place!

It's not Primo, but if you're in the area and looking for something substantial, it's good solid respectable seafood with a strong and diverse menu. Something for everybody, great for lunch or when you're really hungry. Specials are great- especially the haddock Reuben. Great service, strongDrinks.

Came in on a later flight. Concierge sent us here. It was ok, but not outstanding. Service was good, food better than average but for the restaurant type I thought it was a bit pricey at 100 a head for food and drinks. There are better places to go.

The secret is out, this is where the locals go!

This has been one of my favorite restaurants for more than 20 years. Top notch quality food. We have a tradition during Christmas to grab our tree and then stop here to have oysters and clam chowder before going home to decorate....#deliscious#localCharm

Anchor Oyster Bar is located in the Castro District.It's not as famous as Swan Oyster Depot, but locally, it's very popular.The chowder is very good and goes very well with their garlic bread.Make sure to get the Louie Dressing on the side if you get one of their salads.If there is a queue, make sure to sign up on the board near the door.

Small place but excellent food!!!

Our first lunch in San Francisco was the Anchor Oyster bar. Wow what a great place and friendly service. We started with oysters then moved on to seafood salads, trout and I had the crab sandwich. If you are looking for a great place with excellent food the look no farther than the Anchor Bar.

Looked up this place on trip advisor and the ratings were good/excellent so we lyfted to the Castro and got the full anchor special and the ciopinno and settled in for a seafood feast. We happened to get there just before the crowd and enjoyed the banter at the counter and the oyster expertise of the servers. Having eaten in bigger (read touristy) places this little gem is a must eat

The place was a little smaller than imagined, but once we sat down our dinner was pretty great. The service was excellent, and we got a great meal for the right price in san francisco. The salad was really good but my favorite was the crab cakes, bread and butter also great! I would definitely recommend this place for a cute date night in castro.

Husband and I went during the week around 5:30 pm and waited an hour outside to get in. The wait is made easier with samples of fragrant garlic bread and chowder that the restaurant periodically brings out. The place is essentially one room with 5 tables and some bar seating but the decor is nice and the whole place smells like delicious seafood. Definitely would not recommend bringing a large group here - it is much quicker getting a table if you only have 1-2 people than if you have 4+. Split the large Cioppino and we didn't need to order anything else! The bowl of seafood stew was beautifully done and would inspire food envy in anyone. We will be back (though we may come earlier next time!) Make sure you put your name on the whiteboard right outside the door as soon as you get there!

Reading about the long queues, we opted for an early dinner and arrived there by 6pm on a weekday. There wasn't any queue and we were seated within minutes.My wife went for the half serving of oysters, clams and shrimp, while I went with the crabcake entree and we both had a cup of the chowder.My wife loved the oysters so much she went for another 6 (that's 12 oysters). Like other reviews, the oysters tended to be a bit small, but they were fresh and delicious, according to my wife who loves oysters.The chowder was pretty good, especially given that it was cold and windy outside. The crabcake was good, but not fantastic.

I love this place, a very old school homey feeling place. Nothing pretentious, just extremely tasty food. The oysters they have available are fantastic, and the clam chowder is amazing. I'd even recommend the oyster shooters!

Awesome seafood in the Castro. Fresh pacific oyster selection. Authentic New England clam chowder. Creative selection of seafood dishes. The seafood gazpacho was amazing and the crabmeat cocktail delicious packed with Dungeness crab. The chef is creative and enormously talented. It's a small place so go early or be prepared to wait. You won't regret it. 

Delightfully tiny, delightfully delicious

I've been going to Anchor Oyster Bar for over 20 years. This is a real neighborhood place, nothing fancy and no attitude, just delicious, generous portions of wonderful seafood. I always love the clam chowder and you can't go wrong, but the specials are always worth looking at as well. For a night out in the Castro or for a perfect San Francisco experience, start with this place!

Small but nice. Great sea food! Note that their signature dish is at the bottom of the menu... We missed it the first time so had to go back, which I was more than happy to! Oysters are slightly cheaper than Hog place

Longtime Castro District classic. Clean fresh seafood, homey feeling and friendly staff. May have to wait a bit for a table, but it's well worth it. The crab caesar salad is a must! That and Anchor's tasty sourdough bread slathered in their punchy horseradish and you are golden! 

Wish the wait wasnt so long or else i'd be there all the time!

On a whim and in the mood for seafood, me and my date decided to check out Anchor Oyster Bar on a Saturday afternoon. The wait list didnt seem to long but we ended up waiting for a solid hour until we were finally seated. Luckily some groups before us gave up so we were able to get a table quicker.Once inside, i was so happy we waited. We ordered the half order Anchor Special, Clam Chowder and the smaller Cioppino between the 2 of us. It was a lot but we were happy to take on the challenge. Everything was delicious. The flavors were rich and the portions were huge! I would definitely love to come back but the line makes it a challenge. Would not recommend to go in large groups or on a starved tummy.

I only ate here once, by myself, and sat at the counter. Ordered the crab salad, which was large and tasty. Many people were ordering the raw oysters and clam chowder, as well as glasses of white wine. Unfortunately I wasn't able to have an alcohol on that occasion. Very crowded and noisy. No reservations: you sign up on a white board outside, and they call you when space is available for your party. 

The Bomb!
