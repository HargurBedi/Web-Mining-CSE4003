Read about this place on trip advisor a few days ago. Called to see how long the wait would be on a Monday and they advised that there would be 1.5 hour wait. Suggest to call ahead and ask. We went tonight and there as only a 20 minute wait. The staff was friendly, food was good and the value for SF reasonable. The restaurant is small, but cozy, service good. The only thing that annoyed me was that the bathroom was right next to the kitchen and really tiny. It opens into the restaurant. Unfortunately they do not have service outside which would be an advantage for customers and restaurant. Would recommend and will visit again!

Thanks to other guests of the Scarlet Huntington we found this fantastic little pizzeria close to the hotel. A 30 minute wait at 1815 on a Sunday evening was well worth it. Freshly cooked authentic food, great service and value for money is how I would describe it. The place was buzzing. Well done to all!

Came up to the city for dinner and clearly a local favorite as wait would be around an hour. Decided to go to our event and come back around 930pm when it quieted down. Had table available but was still taking orders and restaurant still full of people. Had excellent meal. Ordered the salad mista which was excellent followed by the penne with vodka sauce and calamari steak. Outstanding sauce with the pasta. Calamari steak was delicious. Husband ordered the fernet chocolate dessert which he loved as well. Warm and welcoming family style environment with house wine. Highly recommended.

Enjoyed a great meal here with friends from work. Very good food, nice inviting atmosphere, and felt welcome from the time our feet first walked in. Cannot say enough about the meal - we tried a number of dishes and considered it to be one of the best that we had on our trip. Try the gnocchi! Great area, fantastic restaurant, and exceptional service from true professionals! Give it a try!

We came here on the recommendation of 2 different locals. Saturday night so the wait of 45 minutes wasn't unexpected. Party of three and we were seated at a table with 2 chairs and a windowsill for the third. Had the Chicken Parm which was very large but bland and simply not exciting. Salad,bread, and service were all top notch wish we had tried a different entree.

We ate at the Nob Hill Cafe on our last night in San Fran & it was a great choice. One of my best meals I had while spending 5 days in San Francisco. It is a small local, quaint cafe, serving Italian where locals go. The place is small & the tables are close together. I had the Veal Piccata & it was delicious. We stayed nearby & it was a nice walk. of course being in Nob Hill there are hills to climb. I noticed that a lot of locals came after their Yoga class which was at the Grace Cathedral, which is a beautiful place to visit before dinner. You can never go wrong while traveling & eating with the locals.

This restaurant was recommended by local friends to guests at our hotel who then recommended it to us, and we were glad they did. This is a super popular neighbourhood Italian - you'll be able to spot it from all the people waiting outside. There's no reservations, get there early or be prepared to wait. We arrived at about 6.45 on a Sunday evening and had a 45 minute wait. Inside service is friendly, it's a little bit warm and there's a varied menu with pizzas, pastas and some classic Italian dishes. We ordered a pizza and a pasta to share and were full to the brim. The gnocchi bolognese was a stand out, don't miss it!

It is very small with limited tables and we had to wait about 20 minutes. We got a glass of wine and enjoyed standing outside while we waited. The service was great, the food fantastic and the prices are very reasonable! Easy walk from our hotel, the Fairmont.

Hubby and I always go early (5 pm) to dinner here, as this cafe is understandably popular. It is quaint, friendly and the food is relish! There is sidewalk seating and when we sat down to wait for the cafe to open, a friendly waitress came out promptly. and offered us something to drink - she was delightful and seated us inside as soon as they opened. We both had the tilapia sole with pasta and snap peas and loved every bite! This cafe is in residential Nob Hill and you can see regular customers come in to sit and eat or get dinner to go. We took tiramisu to go - it was scrumptious!

Read the reviews on trip advisor, and also took on board that we may have to wait outside on the side walk.We arrived at 7pm and was told the wait would be around 50 minutes, some 90 minutes later our table finally came free, my children ordered pizza, my wife had a pasta dish and I ordered Calzone, no staters were ordered, some 50 minutes later the food arrived the other meals were fine and mine was stone cold! I complained and was told they could do me another Calzone and wait 50 minutes or order something else, as we had waited for ages to get in and have some food I asked for a tomato sauce with pasta as I was now starving, there was no more said and they knocked my meal off the bill.Over rates place if you ask me, woo not recommend this place.

We went here to try some Italian food in San Francisco. It was a heat wave which was abnormal so the inside seating area was really hot which I assume is not normal for the area. The service was excellent! You get a basket of bread prior to ordering which was a nice added touch. I got the meat lasagne and my boyfriend got the pesto pasta. We both really enjoyed our meal. The wine was great and the special cheesecake we shared was really good as well. Everything was served hot.. borderline too hot which is always nice. The atmosphere was a little dark there was an older couple that used their cell phone as a light when they ate. If I was ever in the area again I would return.

Our first dinner in SF. Conveniently, the Cafe is only two blocks from our hotel in Nob Hill. Although the cafe was full, they seem to have quick turn-over, so it was only a 5 minute wait, with beer on the patio. The pasta plates are huge (hence the title of this review). Plus yummy fresh rosemary bread. Very friendly service. We will definitely be coming back before leaving the city!

We had a great meal at Nob Hill Cafe. Luckily, we got there early and didn't have to wait in lines that are mentioned in other reviews. Food and service were both great! Unfortunately, there was a heat wave in San Fransisco so the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, but I understand most places in the city don't seem to have AC so I can understand if that was the reason why. Overall, I definitely recommend.

British couple both great fans of Italy and Italian food. We tried to be organised and book a table but that wasn't allowed, so we were told to come back and 'wait 20mins' when we wanted to eat. Dutifully we turned up 8:30pm to try and get a table for 2 but we were told that it would be a 45 minute wait. After a long 45 minute wait in the cold (how is this easier/more convenient than booking??) we were seated, unfortunately the food (in our opinion) did not live up to the hype or the excessive wait time. One good thing is the wine, the house red is a decent Italian montepulciano d'abruzzo for $25. Unfortunately the food was all very mediocre. Starting with the strangest antipasti we've ever had (carrots and broccoli?). My girlfriend's pasta dish was fine but my pizza was average at best (if you're from the UK think Pizza Express level). Asked the waitress if the base was fresh rather than preprepared or frozen, which apparently it was but I remain sceptical.Service was fine and decor and cleanliness of the restaurant was good. All in all they do well from the fact that they have little to no competition within a few blocks - if they were up against a genuine Italian restaurant I doubt they would be rated so highly. 

The aromas are amazing!

We didn't eat, which appears to have been a major shame. This little cafe is in the residential neighbourhood of Nob Hill .. not much to choose from .. but they don't abuse the privilege! We just had coffee and a glass of vino but had we had more time (and hadn't had an enormous breakfast) we would have tried the pastas and pizzas on offer. Our server was a little overwhelmed it seemed, but if you were going for a nice lunch and hanging out you wouldn't even notice.

Though we got to the restaurant at 8:30 there was a half hour wait, that could be mitigated by a glass of wine at a couple of small tables outside. During that wait we got to see an unending line of millennials lining up for take out along with some impatient tourists. Once inside we were greeted by a jovial server that made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered the special while my husband had the chicken Parmesan. Both were quite tasty and the house wine (I had white my husband red) was great. Loved it.

Because of the great reviews we decided to wait the 45-60 minutes we were told it would be for a table. It was more like 65 minutes but oh well. It was well worth the wait. We started with the calamari salad to share which was awesome and plenty big enough for the two of us. We then went on to the frutti di mare special pasta and the veal scallopine. Both were excellent. There were so many other dishes I would have loved to try. I wish we lived closer.

This cafe was recommended to us by a member of the hotel staff. Glad we went and wasn't too far to walk (some of the roads killed me walking back). The Cafe is small and adorable, and most importantly, the food was AMAZING....go hungry. For starters the Antipasti Misto was lovely to share, accompanied with a bottle of Chianti Classico Riserva (red). Mains had to be some home made Lasagne al Forno with a side salad and for DOLCI....it had to be Tiramisu.Service was amazing and though we were pressed into the corner, at the back, near the bar, where the waiters were constantly on the move..I can't complain, as the food was amazing AND we didn't book (which is advisable). Defiantly worth a visit when in the neighborhood.

What a great Italian restaurant, fabulous staff who were all professional and considerate, not easy in a busy restaurant.

The steamed red snapper, wrapped in paper, (don't try and eat this, easy to make that mistake), delicious, and their homemade Tiramisu is the ultimate example of how this dessert should be made, you must try it. Elena ! Well she epitomises everything a great waitress should be, humorous, attentive, professional, informative, and added that additional level to what was a great dinning experience. Highly recommend this restaurant. Thanks Elena from a couple of Kiwis.

We make the trek to this restaurant every time we are in San Francisco. It's a small restaurant on a side street near Nob Hill and has great atmosphere as well as good food. Get a table by the window and watch the people go by (and the beautiful red-door apartments across the street), or sit outside if the weather is nice. We have had several of the pizzas...all good. Sip a glass of Chianti with your meal and finish with a chocolate gelato (which is more like ice cream cake) before tackling the hills in the other direction.

You can't reserve a table and there's generally a bit of a wait, I'd recommend calling them first to get an idea of how long you'll be waiting before heading over. Definitely worth the wait though!

Wow what a find, a great small trattoria on Nob Hill, a favorite with the locals

Outstanding food and service, good small wine list, reasonable prices, what's not to like. Meet all the Nobs here, this is a favorite with the neighborhood. Easy walk on Taylor St. almost level (for San Francisco), a couple of blocks north of the cathedral. Really good Italian cuisine, not fancy but just great smells and tastes. A few outdoor tables, small spaces inside, maybe 40-50 seats. Good pizza business going on up front all the time, plus a really good chef in the back kitchen. Yum, I want to go back. Also next door to a small cleaners-laundry and market, hard to find up on Nob Hill. Very close to the Fairmont, Mark Hopkins, and Stanford Court, maybe 5 blocks of easy walking. Don't drive, parking is a bear all over this area.

Delicious!

If you like Italian food, don't miss this restaurant. Good menu with a variety of items. Pasta dishes are good and so is the veal! 

OMG. You have to try this place!

Fantastic and reasonable. The corkscrew pasta with prawns, calamari and mussels in a yellow curry sauce was fantastic. Delicious bread and tiramisu, too. Great friendly service. Simple selection of wine but had my fav chianti Classico. Really outstanding delightful experience in a city with a lot of dining choices. 

Good food. Great atmosphere... and a flat walk, thank God!

Staying at the Mark Hopkins and looking for a simple, casual, nearby place for dinner.Found the Nob Hill Cafe on Trip Advisor and decided to try it out - particularly as getting there didn't involve having to walk up or down one of those serious San Francisco hills.Well it's certainly popular. During the 90 minutes we were there, there was a constant line of people outside on the sidewalk waiting to get in.The food was great. The service friendly. The prices fair. The atmosphere great.No wonder it's been successful for so long.

Perfect food and great service!!

We stayed at the Mark Hopkins overnight prior to a cruise. The cruise representative recommended the Nob Hill Cafe as being an easy walk for us with excellent food. The food was, indeed, delicious. We had the sole, marinara on pasta with snow peas. It has an unassuming appearance from the outside, but once inside the service is excellent and the menu Italian with extensive choices.

Quite a hike but worth it.

If you are in down town ( low altitude) San Fran and you fancy a vertical hike to the top of Nob Hill then make the Nov Hill Cafe your destination, it'll be worth the climb. It's small and busy, prices are reasonable, service great, and ambience fine. The food is well above the average, with all the usual Italian favourites freshly prepared. Off the beaten path but a real gem. 

Great neighborhood Italian place

This was one of our favorite dinners while visiting San Francisco! The food was great and the service was great! Even a reasonable price for the quality of the food. You have to try it.

I imagine there's always queues for this restaurant. Understandable, because it's really good. Due to the cold, was not a good sensation. But the food was. I had a Carbonara and my wife a Lasagna.Not cheap but worth it.

Quaint and enjoy labor dinner

We want there for dinner and had a great meal! The spaghetti carbonara was to die for! Great house wine as well. They don't take reservations so go early!

A winner every time; a favorite neighborhood spot

I continue to come back to Nob Hill Cafe over and over again. The service is consistently solid; food is plentiful and wonderful and the price is pretty spot on for the area.At night, especially on the weekends, you can expect to wait outside for 15-45min, but the girls typically come out and take drink orders so beer and wine while you wait == win. Just be prepared for the wait; if it's cold; have a jacket; obviously. Food, as I mentioned prior, is wonderful. I've pretty much had everything on the menu as well as ripped through a lot of their specials. On the menu I tend to fall back to the veal plate as my goto; but the squid ink seafood bowls are bomb diggity! Go here... you won't be upset. See you there

Cosy cafe and delicious food

The concierge recommended this cafe and we are so glad he did. 5 minutes from our hotel in Nob Hill it is popular with locals and visitors. After travelling for 3 weeks you start to long for home cooked food. This is simple, delicious and fresh food. We have eaten there everyday since we arrived.The pasta is perfect. Fresh pasta and home made sauces. The vegetable soup is so delicious, my kids love it! On the weekend they also serve brunch.The staff are lovely and accomodating. It's small so it gets busy and they don't take bookings, but it is definitely worth the wait.

Top notch

I am a frequent traveler and unfortunately I have become a food snob. That said, knob hill cafe is fantastic! I had the gnocchi and my wife had their ravioli on special. They were delicious. It's a must!

Small cafe with a simple design. Clean enough. Lots of staff provided great service. Small wine pour. Pricey but it is SF. Bread was good. The pastas were tasty, fresh and large portions. The gelato dessert was delicious.

Worth the wait!

This cafe was recommended years ago but I could never connect. Tonight my husband and I hiked up the hill and waited about 35 minutes for an exceptional meal. We both tried specials- pasta with fresh seafood for him and spiral noodles with pesto cream sauce for me. I will tell you my dish was the best spiral noodles I've ever eaten. Perfectly cooked, great flavors and wonderful portions. Our waitress Katrina was friendly and timely. We will certainly be back and hope you enjoy it as well.

Delicious and Cozy

Food is wonderful. Service great. Enjoy a lunch outside and watch all of the passers by. Dinner is crowded and you can't sit outside. Pizza and salads are the best.

Very good neighborhood spot!

Wanted some good Italian food in a local neighborhood and this place definitely fit the bill. We like to eat early anyway, so getting there for 5 was not a problem for us. We got there about 10 minutes to opening and there were two couples ahead of us. There are few tables outside about 15 inside with a very small bar. You are right in the middle of Nob Hill, so location was wonderful. Our server promptly opened the door at five and wanted to know who was first in line. We all walked in and were able to grab whatever table we wanted. We opted for the window table, cozy with a wonderful view of the outside. Our server was prompt and told us about the food and specials. Our food was very good and satisfying. The cafe filled up quickly, so if you are not there by 5 you will wait. We dined on a Sunday evening. We were not rushed and left by 610 and there was a long wait by the time we were leaving.
