We decided to try this restaurant based on the excellent reviews.While the service was very friendly and attentive . The food didn't live up to the hype Had the carbonara was not impressed , it was lacking something can't quite put my finger on it , would not order again .The other pasta dish we tried was slightly better but probably would not return with so many choices in the area.

We went to this restaurant based on reviews. The service was super-friendly, and we were quickly made to feel at home. The food was good--not fantastic, but filling. My veal picata was decidedly lacking in lemon and was heavy with the butter, but my wife's ravioli with wild-mushroom sauce was very good. Overall, I'd say that the dishes tend to the heavier sauces, but that can be a good thing.The key here is having a comfortable dinner in a nice, friendly setting.

We enjoyed everything about our visit to Franchino, including the ambiance, our friendly waitress, and the great food and wine. Our waitress was a family member of this family owned restaurant, and her mom, that day, prepared the specialty dish (Pappardelle-Italian Sausage) that my husband enjoyed. The vinaigrette dressing on my salad was perfect, and my husband oohed and aahed while eating his Minestrone. My Prawns Piccata was the best piccata I've ever eaten. The cost of our meal was reasonable, and, did I mention, the food was excellent. We would definitely return for another dining experience if we return to San Francisco.

I think this restaurant has lost its way. They are a family run restaurant and have been doing business for many years. Although the service was friendly enough there was no sense of genuine connection, the contact felt forced and rushed. The food was fine (excellent fresh prawns) but the pasta dishes were pretty bland. I asked one of the servers, one of the two serving daughters, what was in the house salad and was told leaves, tomatoes carrots and red onions so we ordered two. What arrived was leaves, one half of a cherry tomato each, a tiny bit of grated carrot and an equally tiny amount of red onion. For the price it was disgraceful. We didn't complain just decided not to return. We love italian food and go to Italy often. This restaurant disappointed us both, a shame, maybe too much emphasis on profit, losing sight of their wonderful culinary heritage?

6 years ago, my wife and I honeymooned in San Francisco. On that trip, we got off a bus in Little Italy and just happened upon Franchino. It was an unbelievable meal, and the family that run the place were incredible. Ever since then, we have looked forward to the time when we could return to have another meal. Last week, we were able to, this time with our 3 year old (who loved the spaghetti noodles with white sauce that they hooked us up with)As the waitress listed off the specials, she informed us that her mom had a couple of dishes that she had decided to whip up that day that weren't on the menu. One was a Lobster filled ravioli with a tomato creme sauce and shrimp bits. I had to try it. I was blown away. (I have posted a picture of this wonderful meal)I hope our next visit to Franchino will not be 6 years from now. It's a gem of a place. One of my all time favorite restaurants that I've ever been too.

Walked here after returning from our Alcatraz tour. The caprese salad was a great starter. For the main course we had the lasagna and chicken piccata. Both were excellent but the piccata was amazing! We often order meals and then split them half and half which we did this time. My husband loved the piccata so much he ordered a SECOND order of it which he has never done. The noodles are def. homeade. This place is family run and you can tell the care they put into the meals. We traveled to Italy in May of this year and this meal was better than any we had there.

Small place with great food! My wife is Italian and cooks some of the best dishes ever she learned to make from her Sicilian mother. That being said, we're from Chicago and it's still really hard to find good Italian. We chose this place based on the reviews and we're glad we did. My linguini and clams was awesome and my wife really enjoyed the eggplant parmesan! Great wine and food at reasonable prices. Slightly different flavor from the Sicilian I've been enjoying for the past 45 years but wow, really good.

I was in a group of 10, and we were treated warmly and attentively throughout the evening. All the servers were friendly and helpful, and Mama Franchino was the subject of photos by nearly every table of visitors. Their homemade pasta is the best, and I went for traditional meatballs in meat sauce. It was delicious, and next time I'd get the pasta with clams. We had a sampling of appetizers and desserts for the table, and all would be worth a try separately.

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner at the recommendation of a co-worker and we were not disappointed. The owner's wife waited on us and she was so friendly and helpful as well as the rest of the staff who were clearly also family. The service was spot on and the restaurant is cozy with the feeling that you are in their home and you are treated as intimate guests. You can tell that this family prides itself on their service and the food that they provide their customers. I don't know that you can have a religious experience over food, but it came pretty close for us. At the recommendation of the owner's wife, I tried the gnocchi that was on special last Friday and it was literally the best thing I have every tasted the pasta that my boyfriend ordered was just as magical. Just outstanding. I highly recommend this quaint little restaurant if you are looking to have some wonderful, fresh, homemade, authentic Italian cuisine. We will definitely be coming back for more.

Franchino's is a small, casual Italian restaurant that is family run. Grandma greeted us and waited on us most of our meal and was over the top accomodating and friendly. Pasta of the day is fresh - just made.... my Pappardelle with salmon and a pink sauce to die for. She recommended a sampler of appetizers which was a great way to start a fantastic meal. Best thing of all - pasta was around $20 which is at least $10 cheaper per entree than anywhere else we ate....a real find!

We went on a Wednesday night at about 6:00 PM and were able to get seated right away. It is a very small restaurant, only 12 tables, so we were happy to not have a long wait. This was by far the best food we had on vacation and possibly ever! We loved that it was family owned and run. They really cared about the food and service. If we visit San Francisco again we would love to go back!

Wanted to write a quick review here after my second visit to this restaurant. My boyfriend took me here on Valentine's Day and then we came again with our parents for Father's Day. Just...just really nice. I want to come up with a more flamboyant adjective, but that's the one that fits. This is simply a great, family run restaurant in North Beach with truly tasty, homemade food. My personal favorite in the lasagna, but others liked their gnocchi, spaghetti, ravioli and Chicken Marsala. I feel like you can't go wrong with Franchino's Nothing flashy or over the top here - they don't need it. The food and friendly service speaks for itself. Franchino's is quickly becoming one of our regular spots in North Beach.

We found this place through Trip Advisor and were able to get a reservation at the last minute (it was early for dinner but we were lucky since it was Mother's Day weekend). This is a small, mom and pop place. It was obvious that our waitress was a member of the family who owned the place. She was very knowledgable and nice. The only low point of our meal was the bread which was something you could buy at the grocery store. But everything else was very good. The chicken piccata was excellent. The homemade tiramisu and cannoli were fabulous. The service was very efficient and the prices very good. They definitely want to turn tables as the place is very small but we didn't feel rushed. Definitely recommend.

I went for dinner with my cousin who has lived in San Francisco her entire life and she raved about her new favorite Italian restaurant in this city. We went around 5:30 pm and it was already half full but we got a nice table for two by the window. Mama served us and was so delightful. I wanted a Sicilian wine but found they didn't have it; she recommended one off the menu and it was superb and not expensive (compared to what we could have ordered). My cousin had the grilled salmon and it was perfectly cooked and just a little too much for her. We shared a gnocchi with mushrooms in a nice cream sauce that was heavenly! I had the rigatoni arrabiata and it was perfectly seasoned and spicy enough. The portions were generous and although both of us were hungry, we were full and did not have room for desert. I highly recommend this place; it reminded me so much of the old New York Little Italy family restaurants that are sadly diminishing there.

Following one tasty lunch there I have mixed feelings. The place is a nice, authentic, family-run Italian restaurant. The food (seafood pasta) was quite good. The young lady that was perhaps Mr Franchino's daughter (just guessing) was friendly and helpful, and even responded to our attempts at speaking Italian. So why the mixed feelings? Our bill was presented to us flipped to the other side, with an extra $20. That is, the breakdown of the prices was hidden in the back, and the total that was presented did not match the breakdown. When confronted the lady who served us acknowledged it was a mistake, but honestly she was not very convincing in her explanation. I'm giving her the benefit of doubt -- mistakes happen -- and thus four stars, as apart from that everything was fine.

This family owned and operated restaurant is the best of what an Italian restaurant should be. Comfortable, friendly, Intimate - and great food. We were a family group of 7, celebrating the meeting of my granddaughter's fiancee. While we were there another couple got engaged to the cheers and applause of the entire restaurant. Many of us enjoyed the special of lobster and shrimp ravioli. I shared this with my wife who ordered veal picatta - yum.The staff did a great job - Mama kept the water glasses full. We were so full that we passed on dessert. Maybe, next time.

Buddy and I were looking for pasta and happened to walk by this place. He had lasagna and said it was excellent. I got the chicken parmigiana with homemade pasta.

With the Italian restaurant competition in north beach being tough I can see why ristorante franchino continues to get folks in the door. No complaints and I highly recommend. I'll be back no doubt.

We had a family dinner here for my partner's birthday (2 kids, 2 adults). We ordered different things so we could try several dishes. The Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo was hands down the best we had ever had. The lasagna, Bolognese, and Mushroom Risotto were all incredible as well, but the Alfredo just blew us all away.We enjoyed some wine and had tiramisu for dessert, which we shared because we had cake earlier in the day and didn't want to go overboard.The service was wonderful, this is clearly a family-owned establishment. The staff interacted so well, and the mother came by to make sure everything tasted great. When I go back to San Francisco, this restaurant will be on my list revisit.

My wife and I were wandering through North Beach on Friday night definitely in the mood for Italian. This restaurant is tiny, with seating for only a couple of dozen patrons. There was a table for two in the window with a great view so we stopped by. The restaurant is ran by a mother and her two daughters. We started with some minestrone, which was very good. My wife ordered the gnocchi and said it was the best she's ever had (and she has had a lot of gnocchi). The special that night was homemade gnocchi serve three ways (alfredo, pesto, and tomato sauces). The presentation was delightful as it was presented to look like the Italian flag. I had the pappardelle, which had been made by "mama" earlier that day. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the dish tasted incredible. We topped it off by having and a homemade chocolate cannoli, which was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. The service was excellent, with recommendations tailored to our tastes, which were spot on. We will definitely go back the next time we are in town.

Delish--and then some.The restaurant seats about 40 patrons maximum. We reserved for 20 on a busy Friday night, and they accepted, graciously. No contracts, no credit card guarantee, nothing other than a kind ask--please arrive with your full party, on time. Our group of 20 arrived on time and were seated promptly.This is a small, family run business, and they take great pride in their food and service.I'm confident our home kitchen is much larger than the kitchen at the Ristorante Franchino, but you'd never know it.Our waitress was present and prepared immediately. She took appetizer, drink and entree orders quickly and efficiently. What was truly amazing, in addition to the high quality food, was the timing of the service.Salads for twenty arrived almost simultaneously. Entrees arrived subsequently, hot, and all at once.Our crew had most of everything on the menu and not a single person was anything other than delighted. Delighted!About half the group had dessert and also raved. Price was very fair for the quality. Very fair.It was our first trip to Franchino but I promise, not our last.

I have been to Franchino's one time with my friend and ex-wife. The restaurant is small and cozy and family owned. Franchino and his wife and their daughter work at the restaurant. I remember Franchino's wife telling me everything is always fresh since they don't overstock products due to the size of the restaurant. We started off with the Scamorza (smoked Mozzarella) which was too die for delicious. The prosciutto and melon and marinated squid were also outstanding. The appetizers were full of great flavor. For entrees we had the veal pizzaiola, the Gnocchi and cheese tortellini which were all delicious. I had the tiramisu which was spectacular. My friend and ex-wife ordered the cannoli but they were all out so they had the ice cream. I have heard that Franchino sings as well although we didn't hear him sing the night we were there. He usually sits outside the restaurant on his chair greeting his customers. They are a very friendly family and their passion for food is obvious. Outstanding restaurant.

We dined at Bottega in the Napa valley three nights before, so my review may be clouded by apples to oranges. Franchino is a lovely, family restaurant. The service is warm and welcoming. My husband's veal was so tender that it could be cut with a fork. This restaurant does a nice job with restaurant staples and is very welcoming. It is not cutting edge or elevated; but I am sure that is not what they aspire to, I wish that Tripadvisor would create a middle ground category so that there was a better way rate restaurants. This restaurant is better than "average" and not quite "very good."

This was Italian food like I remember my friend's Mom making throughout my childhood. Home made pastas and sauces like I haven't experienced for decades. When the owner is the cook (and you see her there during your meal) and her daughter is your server, you know that a genuine, freshly made and cooked meal lies ahead.I wanted to order every dish I passed by as I walked to my table. Finally, I chose the gnocchi, which was terrific- fluffy and flavorful. This was by far the best meal of my stay in San Francisco.

We would also recommend the cannoli and the Bomba for dessert. Reasonably priced and I ate way too much ( big portions and just so delicious I could not stop eating).

A shame on the name of Italian food! I have lived in Italy and a food connoisseur and was saddened to see that the sole reason why this "26 year old family-run Italian business,* is in existence simply because of its location in a heavily trafficked tourist area. The pasta with seafood was drowned in tomato sauce to camouflage the stale fish which was so chewy that chewing on plastic seems much more inviting. I tried my best to chew, but a futile endeavor and had to spit it out. The only positive comment I can make is that the female server was pleasant and attentive. My recommendation- if your advertising tag line is " family-run," then give a family meal to customers not pasta soaked in canned tomato sauce and chewy fish, making it it a very expensive inedible chewy chow!

I love the fact that it's still family owned, and the family makes many of the dishes from scratch. The servers are friendly and most have been there for years. The food is awesome. My son had the gnocchi and I had chicken piccata. We also shared bruschetta. All were excellent and very tasty. We weren't rushed, and despite the small size of the restaurant, it wasn't too noisy. We were perfectly capable of hearing each other without raising our voices. We will definitely be back!!

I first discovered Franchino in 1997. I live in Georgia and eat there whenever I am in San Francisco. They have the best red sauce anywhere. You can taste the difference with the homemade pasta and sauce. The restaurant's small size and family service are part of what makes it so special. My recommendation is to ask Guiseppina (Mama) or one of the daughter waitresses about that day's specials and order one of those. Franchino is also the home of the best lasagna on the planet. I absolutely love this place and give it my highest recommendation.

Excellent food!

We love this place ! From the homemade pasta to the small intimate seating and Mama's greeting ! This is the real deal ! A family affaire that has been around for a long time. It has been five years since last I was in this place and Mama chastised me to not wait so long before returning ! There are many good places to go in LittleI Italy but this is my favorite !!

We found this little gem in the hustle and bustle of Columbus Avenue. Family owned and freshly made food. Everything we had was delicious...gnocchi with Gorgonzola, linguine with clam sauce, Alfredo tortellini. All perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. You won't be disappointed.

I stopped in one day while wandering north beach and was pleasantly surprised. Excellent Italian American dishes produced with love. I asked the owners if they had relatives in NJ where I grew up. And it turned out they were cousins of my former next door neighbors!! Great marshals sauce with mushrooms

Wonderful experience!

Excellent food at reasonable prices. Family seated us and waited on us -- and probably cooked, too!. Chicken piccata was top notch. My sons enjoyed the cheese ravioli w/ alfredo and tomato sauce. My husband gave the chicken marsala high marks. And they will tweak to meet your tastes or diet restrictions. Only negative comment -- the house chardonnay wasn't the best, but we really went for the food.

Best Pasta Ever!

We had 2 pasta meals after no reservations were made. The restaurant was nice and busy with the hustle and bustle of a lovely Italian family. The lasagna and creamy pasta we had were superb. Some of the best we've ever had, authentic Italian! Will be recommending here for our friends!

The mussels were everything that other people said! Fantastic! Both of our meals were delicious, couldn't finish we were so full but kept trying! As a 1 st time visitor to San Francisco to stumble across this I am more than overjoyed. Best meal we had here! You will not go wrong in dinning here! We can't find anything this delicious back in northern Ohio when it comes to Italian 

Family run, delicious, lovely experience

A friend and I randomly selected Franchino for a Tuesday-night dinner in March 2016. We arrived around 6 without a reservation, and had no trouble getting a seat (though it was probably 3/4 full). Our server was friendly let us know that her mom had made the specials that evening. My friend had one of that night's specials, and I had the meat ravioli with porcini cream sauce. We started with the bruschetta and everything was absolutely terrific. They consulted with us on the wine and opened a bottle to let us try before we committed to it. It was obvious this place attracts lots of regulars, and if I lived in the area I would definitely be among them!

I LOVE Franchino--it's a classic "red sauce" restaurant in North Beach with the warmest family vibe. Old-fashioned comfort food like chicken parmigiana are done well, and the bruschetta appetizer satisfies any lingering carb cravings. Perhaps the thing I like best here is the friendly greetings, the impeccable service, and the frank, honest, unpretentious menu. Nothing precious here, just a comfortable, delicious, warm dining experience.

After working late a few nights at a convention set-up, I was ready for a nice dinner. This restaurant had good reviews, and they were right! The small, charming, family-owned restaurant was just the ticket. While it was full, there were no lines. We were seated in just a few minutes and treated with fresh bread and an incredible family history by one of Zupina's daughters. The pasta special and veal saltimbocca were delicious, and who can resist cheese cake and cannoli for dessert? Yummy! Very good wine selection as well.....love the Amarone Valpolicella!

We dined on a week night in this small ,charming looking restaurant in San Francisco's Little Italy. Our server was friendly and enthusiastic. Unfortunately the food and drinks here are well below par. The Italian bread brought to the table was ordinary and our entrees were awful. I ordered the calamari with pasta which tasted like I would imagine fried rubber bands would taste. Desert was likewise unspired and tasted store purchased. The decaf espresso tasted muddy. The wine by the glass offerings are limited to about 4 whites and 4 reds. Between my wife and I we ordered 4 different glasses of wine all of which were of poor quality and which did nothing to enhance the evening. I tasted three of the whites and all were childishly sweet.

I had called ahead to make reservations for 5 people on a Saturday night and so glad that I did since it is a very small family run restaurant. My daughter and I split the mussels in a delectable spicy red sauce. The sauce was so good, we dipped our bread in it. The mussels were large and plump. We thought the lasagna was excellent and reminded us of our meals in Rome. The servers were friendly and very attentive. I would highly recommend eating here but you should have a reservation or it may be quite a wait.

This tiny North Beach restaurant has an excellent menu and very reasonably priced wine list. I had the Eggplant Parmesan: sliced wafer-thin, tender with just the right amount of cheese. My husband had the cioppino, which had a rich, deep broth. The tiramisu was light, fluffy, and great coffee flavor - not too sweet. The place is family run, with both mom and daughters stopping by to chat during the meal. An overall excellent dinner experience.

If you want to feel welcome by a family and eat the most amazing and fresh Italian food this is the place. Mama and her Daugherty make you feel welcome from the time you enter this small restaurant it what may be considered a tourist area of North Beach. The food is excellent all made with fresh ingredients and prepare like you were the only customer there. It is family run and you can tell by they way you are treated. My wife and I cannot this recommend this restaurant any higher if you want great food and great service. We are in SF for the next month and I could eat here every day.

This place was a lifesaver as we were in San Francisco with an 82 year old looking for real Italian food. The restaurant is family owned and run and the food is good. We especially liked the chicken piccata. The pesto was not as good, though, so we recommend meat over pasta. It's a cute little restaurant but busy so be sure to make a reservation. :)

The best!

This is a small, family run Italian restaurant. Mom makes all of the pasta herself every morning. 3 daughters waitress for this small place, so the service is excellent. I had a pasta dish special of the day, and my wife had the chicken piccata. Both were outstanding, and the waitress suggested an excellent wine pairing. If we lived here, we would be regulars!

Love this small restaurant with daily specials and family atmosphere. Dad owns, Mother cooks, children serve. Have to say the wine list is reasonable. Favorite dish has got to be the Veal Piccata. Totally worth the wait that usually exists as this place is justifiably popular.

We had a large party of 9 and other than the owner of this restaurant being concerned that we all got there at the same time, this small, family run Italian restaurant lived up to its reviews. The pasta, veal and service were top notch. We were too full to try the desserts. The wine list was adequate and affordable. Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quiet delicious Italian joint. It was the real thing.

Great little family Italian restaurant in North Beach. Their best dishes are the pasta specials - homemade pasta and cannelloni. Prices are reasonable and the service is excellent. If you want to avoid the large big-name restaurants and have great food this is an excellent choice. Go early, it gets crowded as the evening progresses.

TripAdvisor sent us to this restaurant. If you want something authentic, small, warm, good food this is your place. We wanted Italian in North Beach. We did not want the place where all the tourists went with long lines. This was perfect. Real family run Italian restaurant. Our waitress referred to Mamma a number of times and we saw Mamma selected wine for some dinner guests. Very good food - I had veal piccata and a side of the homemade pasta ( not all is homemade but they will tell you which ones are). We had a great, wine, a wonderful chocolate cannoli for dessert. We took the bus to North Beach from Mission and 3rd street. We walked to Coir Tower after dinner to see the views and then walked all the way back to the hotel.

Eating at this tiny restaurant is like going to your nonna's house for Sunday dinner. The staff are friendly and interested in your happiness. My kids refer to it as "the restaurant with the nice people." It's a small cozy place, probably seating less than 40 people at once. We enjoyed everything we ordered, from Alfredo to Carbonara. Leftovers were taken home. Dessert was also yummy, but don't expect to share, as they are perfectly proportioned for one person.

Met my friend and her husband here for dinner and the place did not disappoint. Good Italian is rare where I come from, so this place was a welcome treat. We shared an appetizer of mussels in spicy red sauce, which everyone enjoyed. The gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce was perfect. The men ordered two different veal dishes. Both were amazing.Despite the limited seating, we felt comfortable and uncrowded. Our waitress was also very friendly.

Great little family owned and operated restaurant in North Beach. Four of us visited this place while in town and each of us ordered different menu items. Each were cooked to perfection. Presentation was excellent as was the service. Truly a family operated business. The waitresses were daughters of the owners and one of their sons was working that night. While I personally have never had a bad meal in North Beach, I would rate this as the best I have had. Definitely will go back the next time I am in San Fran. Just like being back in Italy.

Randomly stopped by this tiny little restaurant on a Sunday night. They had an usually large table that caused them to be a bit delayed. The staff was very aware of this. They worked extremely hard to keep up with the tables and worked even harder to make up for the delay. When the table finally cleared we ended up with the friendliest service I've ever had. The sisters working were just wonderful and the food matched the service. We had delicious sea food pasta and the best authentic tiramisu I've ever had. I will definitely be returning on my next San Fran visit. Thank you Franchinos!

Every pasta dish we ordered was prepared well in addition to the eggplant parmesan. The cheese appetizer was surprisingly great. No creative dishes. The restaurant is a bit more expensive than the informal presentation merited. Though the wait staff was helpful and in good spirits. The zabaglione was served hot and fresh as it should be.
