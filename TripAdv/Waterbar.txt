We went here for drinks before dinner. It was a great place. The bar and bartenders were fun and the view of the bay bridge at nighttime was excellent. We sat in front of the oyster bar that had at least 6 different specialty oysters. We really enjoyed it. 

The lobster is a must!

Lovely night under the Bay Bridge lights.Had a party of 10 for a 70th birthday party and we could not have had a more wonderful time. Service is impeccable as they went out of their way to make sure our large group got the best possible view. We started out with the Oyster Platters - they chose 3 of the best of samplers from Washington State to Point Reyes. Just delicious. I think they have the best Caesar Salad which they don't serve every night but it was the best I've had in ages. The guests had the Scallops, Halibut and the dry aged New York steak. I can't wait to go back when I can sit outside and just enjoy the Bay with some wine and Oysters. This is a must go to restaurant.

This restaurant is located right near the Bay bridge. What a beautiful site of the bridge and it's lights. The food and service was excellent. The only con was the noise and a little hectic with service staff going back and forth. The shrimp cocktail was excellent as well as the sea bass and halibut. 

The most tasty starters we have had!

We arrived on a Friday evening in early October. The restaurant and bar area were full so we queued to sit outside. Fortunately we only needed to wait 15 mins.We ordered four different starters to share between the 4 of us. The waiters was very helpful, adding one extra portion, to one starter that only came with 3 items.We all agreed that all four starters were superb. I do not say that often, the dishes were well presented and the delicate combination of ingredients were skilfully out to give a wonderful combination of flavours hitting the pallet. Each was better than the other. Device for drinks was slow, however the starters get 5 stars. The location was atmospheric with the sun setting and the bridge above us illuminating as in got darker.Highly Recommended.

Bday FIRST and LAST TIME

We made a reservation one mounth ago. Occasion: Bday. Had confirmation from the restaurant that we are going to have table close to the window with view as requested.We arrived on time, the table was not ready and not even close to the request. We were given attitude on the host station by a gentlemen who might be even a Manager (with glasses) after we asked if would be possible to wait on the bar and having drinks meanwhile...after 15min we were seated and took more than 15 min for someone to come and just water us. No one come at all. We left...spectacular location and view but horrible service and unacceptable attitude given to potential valuable customers.So on the Bday day we did end up looking for place where we can have a dinner and keep the positive mood....

A 30th birthday surprise disaster

Date: October 21, 2017
I surprised my girlfriend with a trip to San Francisco as we had never been and it was her 30th birthday. I made the reservation for 7:30pm 2weeks prior with a request to be seated at a window or romantic table with a view. When we arrived on time the table was not ready. My girlfriend suggested that we can have a drink at the bar. The male hostess rudely said no you have to be seated. So we waited for 10minutes standing around and then sat and then proceeded to wait another 15minutes before we decided that this is ridiculous and that the restaurant staff obviously did not care. A completely cold and neglected feeling and experience. Absolutely horrible surprise for my girlfriend on her birthday night. A beautiful scenery but that is about it. The face that greats you at the hostess station firstly should never say no and secondly should be a positive as it is the first impression of restaurant.

I recently was at an event here and the food was just as spectacular as the views! Chef, can you make me that Risotto every night?! Absolutely amazing service, views, everything. They even have valet, since there is no parking in the area. Definitely a cool spot to go to. I recommend visiting at night to see the amazing views of the bridge that lights up at night. Will go again soon!

My wife and I had a great dinner at Waterbar for our 5th anniversary. I was most impressed with the staff who were very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to ordering. The food was great but there was some variability in what we really enjoyed and what we thought was just good. Obviously when you are at a place where the worst part was that a single portion of your meal was just good rather than great you know you are at a fine establishment. I would eat here again for sure. Check it out if in that area.

We had a group dinner at the Waterbar and found the service and the food impeccable. The restaurant is located almost directly under the Bay Bridge and offers a gorgeous sunset view of the ocean. The food was delicious. I had the salmon and my husband had the sirloin - both were prepared well and served promptly. The wait staff were very attentive and courteous. I highly recommend this restaurant when visiting San Francisco.

Why do we go out to eat? For me it's to spend time with loved ones and friends in an enjoyable relaxed location while eating great food. This trip to SF has been solo with family and friends left behind. I chose the water bar because I thought it would be a lively place with a fab view of the bay bridge and great food. 2 out of 3 is not so bad and if the price had been 40% lower then I would have had a wonderful evening. However at $100 plus for the food it just wasn't good enough. Don't get me wrong, I had a good evening. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful and the maitre'd made a great wine recommendation but generally the food was a just that little bit disappointing. Maybe I am spoiled by British seafood in Cornwall but I expect more; especially for the money. The oysters were small and lacking substance and with hindsight I would have been better choosing for myself rather than taking the chef selection deal. On this one I am clearly spoiled by the oysters from around the UK. On the appetiser and entree I can't make the same excuses; they just didn't quite make the mark. The pork stuffed squid appetiser was over cooked and a little on the rubbery side with too much chilli. The biggest issue was the pork over whelmed the squid. It didn't matter how I loaded the fork, the squid was lost. As my waiter described it - the squid is a casing for a park sausage. Tasty if that's what you want but I was expecting more 'squidiness' from a restaurant that specialises in seafood. The accompanying mango was solid and under ripe. You could argue it was meant as a counterpoint to the softer squid but the squid wasn't soft enough and the mango didn't cut the chilli heat so was somewhat pointless other than making an expensive appetiser with two small stuffed squid seem like better value (on a mouthful to $ basis).The main course of seabass was tasty but over complicated with too much going on, too many flavours on the plate, and again the main ingredient, the bass, was over cooked. Is it just my European tastes that expect my fish to have a little transparency and opaqueness in the middle? The star of the show here was the mussels which were superb, big, meaty and full of flavour.The chocolate tasting for dessert was very good with a selection of chocolate desserts that were deep on flavour and short on sweetness, a perfect end to the meal.Would I go back again? Probably not. I think SF has better to offer and the view, buzz and staff don't make up for the shortcomings in the food. Seafood deserves a little more respect.

Visited Waterbar for our first night of a long weekend / anniversary trip in San Francisco. Outstanding. Location and views are great as you read in most every review. The view of the Bay Bridge as the sunsets and the light show takes over is really impressive along with the water traffic and the general flow of people in The Embarcadero area. With the reservation, I noted our anniversary dinner and Waterbar delivered with a nice champagne toast to start the evening and a nice desert at the end. Our dinner was top notch. The Sea Scallop and Crab dip apps were phenomenal (my wife and I agreed that the sea scallops were some of the best we have had anywhere) and our main dishes (Salmon and Tuna) were top notch. Sadly, we didnt try any oysters, but you can tell that is the pick of the place for most folks. Definitely pricey, but for a fun or special night out, this is a top pick!

Go to Waterbar if you love oysters - they have the widest and deepest selection of oysters probably available anywhere in the US. However, if you look for different foods, you may be in for a less impressive treat: Their starters are mostly excellent, however, as you proceed in to the main courses, we got increasingly less impressed; and, a few of them we just tasted, but left them nearly un-eaten on the plates. The place is too nice for that to happen. Very un-even food experience! On top of that: Slow service where you have to fight for attention. We had expected more from this place! The day we were there, their bathrooms were colsed, so you had to go to their neighboroughs - strange experience!

My husband and I were in town for a conference and I was looking for a unique, highly rated restaurant for dinner. The Waterbar was recommended to us. It's located at the foot of the Bay Bridge and has lovely views. Our Uber driver found the restaurant easily and dropped us off at the front door. We walked in and were promptly seated for our 7 PM reservation. The great service continued and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. The restaurant was full, the wait staff were hustling, however, we never felt rushed. For appetizers we ordered the stuffed squid and the grilled scallops. For dinner we selected blue fish and the salmon dish. All the food was delicious and was presented pleasingly. The menu changes frequently; I am certain that whatever they prepare would be a good choice. We were checked on frequently to be sure that all was satisfactory and appreciated the attention. Add Waterbar to you list of restaurants to eat at while in SanFrancisco.

We were in the City and friends came down from wine country to spend the day with us so this was more of a day drinking, eating and sort of site seeing kind of day. We stared with Waterbar as they have oysters for $1.05 each during the day! So we ordered 24 oysters and wine. Very reasonable choices among their wine list. Were ordered a couple other items to nibble and then went to our next stop. The nibbles and oysters were very good, no complaints. The bartenders were very attentive as we all sat at the bar. Waterbar has a nice view of the bay bridge and I would recommend.

My wife and I are native San Franciscans and have been to many of the fabulous restaurants that our city has to offer. however, my wife had never been to The Waterbar on the Embarcadero virtually underneath the iconic Bay Bridge. She is pescatarian and very cosset of which fish is acceptable for consumption. That being said, the menu at Waterbar facilitated her "picky palate" and more than sustained mine. From the appetizers (Crab cocktail for me & peach salad for the wife) to the entrees (Bluefish for her & whole Branzino for me) and the dessert of which we split a helping of peach pie a la mode, were exquisite. It was the perfect romantic setting, with huge bay windows and gigantic fish tanks next to our table on top of a lovely evening that just made our experience magical! Through all of this we had a fantastic server (Sofia K) that was as attentive as we have had in all of our travels domestic and abroad. She knows the menu and what should accompany the items of choice and has a beautiful spirit and character about her. Thank you Sofia and The Waterbar staff for such a great evening!

For our last night, we chose this restaurant because of the lovely view and the menu. Both were perfect. Service is friendly and efficient. Plenty of oyster varieties to choose from. We had the Fanny May and French Kiss. It did make me laugh to see the note requesting patience for the shucking to order. Living in New Orleans, we know how fast shuckers can go, especially on nights when the oysters are 50 cents each... We each had different fish entrees, prepared perfectly with nice accompaniments. We stuck to martinis all night, but did notice a nice wine list.

My husband and I met some friends who live in the area for dinner at Waterbar. The views are exactly as pictured here and of course better in person! The service was fantastic, the food was incredible, and the views would be hard to beat in most any city. The bridge had falling lights that we watched over conversation and a gourmet meal. The oysters were reportedly good from my table mates (I tried one but just don't have a taste for them unfortunately) however the SASHIMI a rotating chef item I believe was one of the best items I've ever had. So fresh, complex and just awesome! I would also recommend the filet, mine was cooked perfectly and the generous portion of vegetables that it came with were such a compliment to the excellent cut of beef. Yes, it's a pricey meal but absolutely worth it for a celebration, special occasion, or just to get a gourmet fix in a very relaxed, yet elegant environment. We will be back!

The best thing about the Waterbar is the location and views at night! Definitely a romantic restaurant but be prepared for an expensive bill - especially if you are having a glass of wine. Dinner for two including tip was close to $300. I wanted to go here as the vews are spectacular and the food is very good if overpriced. Disappointed after telling the maitreD that we came for our 30th anniversary and made reservations well in advance to have a table by the window we were seated in the middle of the restaurant. We had a lovely waitress Yetem who was attentive and gave good recommendations. We began the meal with tuna sashimi and Corn Ravioli - which were both delicious. For the main dish, I had the salmon poached in olive oil which was much lighter than it sounds. My husband had the miso glazed halibut which he enjoyed. As sides we ordered parmesan fries and broccoli di Cicco - broccoli with a fried egg on top. The broccoli was good but the parmesan fries were cold and not worth eating. Our waitress graciously took them off our bill when we mentioned that toher at the end of the meal.We decided to split an unusual dessert - peach pie with basil - while the pie itself was delicious the basil was not a good addition. We noticed when we got our bill that a nearby table was presented with complimentary hors dourves for their anniversary. We mentioned to Yetem that it was disappointing that after conversing with the host regarding celebrating our anniversary at their romantic restaurant why the table next to ours received something while noone wished us an enjoyable meal. Yetem right away brought us over two chocolate bites on a plate with "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate. We appreciated her gesture but would not return there in the future - there are an abundance of restaurants nearby with the same view - which never disappoints.

This is one of the best dining experiences my wife and I have had in a long time. From when you first walk in you are treated as a special guest. While waiting at the bar for our table (we were early) several staff members ask for our drink order so we didn't have squeeze between people seated at the bar. Once seated our waiter was attentive and charming. and throughout the meal the management staff mingled in the dining room speaking with the patrons, answering questions , and explaining the restaurant's philosophy without being the least bit intrusive. The food was excellent. Oysters , crab cocktail zucchini flowers, Sea Bass and Sole cooked to perfection and served with interesting sides. A bit pricey but worth the extra cash. Lasty the view is the cherry on top of the sundae or should I say the pearl in the Oyster !

One of the places to be seen right now. Place is crowded--full, with lines at 6 p.m. even just to get a drink--at least on pretty sunny June days when nearby restaurants next door and across the street have plenty of room. Say what you will--and there's plenty to say--about the gorgeous water view, the outdoor patio, bridge views and the proximity to the Ferry Building for those arriving or about to leave from/for the other shore, it's all about the cool drinks and the seafood. For out of towners, the plentitude of dishes involving Dungeness crab (as pictured in the photo that accompanies this listing) are a particular treat, and the kitchen showed off great prowess. Loved everything--was definitely worth the wait.

This lovely restaurant is popular with locals and tourists alike. Located on the waterfront with a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge, this is THE place to go for fabulous sea food and oysters from all across the country. We had a table inside between two tall aquarium pillars overlooking the waterfront. The patio is wonderful during good weather, but we went in March when the evenings were a bit too chilly.. We were lucky, as were the guests of old family friends. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to the Bay Area. Try to get there 1/2 hour before sunset and watch the reflections of the sunset in the water and the Bay Bridge lights go on.

So. My partner and I traveled on vacation to San Francisco, a city that we love. We live in Phoenix, have lived in Las Vegas, and are pretty cultured. We have a six figure salary range and we typically dine well. We had been looking forward to our experience at WaterBar since March when I booked our trip. We dined there on July 2nd. The restaurant is gorgeous. The view outside the restaurant is gorgeous. Our weather was gorgeous. We were set-up for a wonderful experience. Except, well, the service. Both our bar and our table service were horrible. The host made a rude comment. And one of the bathroom stalls was disgusting. My halibut was quite tasty. My wife had the "last" duck in the house. The meat was prepared properly. The potato side dish was overly spiced. Not that the server would know. He never checked back once our food was received. He also refused to take our order until we were ready to place the whole thing. We like to course our meals ourselves to ensure that we have adequate time to enjoy things. He came to pour wine once during our meal after I reached around myself to grab the wine out of the ice bucket. While at the bar, we had drinks and a couple of oysters. Again, after taking our order, we never saw our server. In fact, we checked in at the host stand to see how long it would be before we could be seated (15 minutes after our reso time). The host said, "Whenever you are ready. We are just waiting on you." We asked for their help in getting our bill transferred or finding someone who could help us pay out. We did that. When seated, after being told we had to order everything all together, my partner asked about the duck. We were told they were out but that the server would go check and report back. He never did. When he came back to take our order, my partner again asked about the duck and the server said, "Oh yeah, we have one left." Honestly, the meal was one of the most disappointing that I have ever had. This is too bad given that many of our friends had completely different experiences and we were really looking forward to dining there.

The place is really nice with a great view. I had a reservation and still had to wait over 30mins, then they said I didn't had a reservation and after a while they noticed the made a mistake. Anyway, it's a good place to have dinner, just make sure you have a reservation.

Excellent place to have it all!

We visited the Waterbar as our fancy good option for the weekend. The restaurant is more upper class which is reflective in the price. They offer a good selection of fresh oysters and other seafood. Dungeness crab is very popular here, but a bit awkward to eat from the shell in a fancy place like this. The oysters were very good. Save some space for dessert as well. Service was great, very attentive and friendly.Overall our consensus was that this was a 3.5 experience. The service got me to round it up to a 4. I would suggest we had better meal experiences at a more affordable price elsewhere. 

Unimpressed.

Sorry, not impressed. Great view of the Bay Bridge, service was impeccable but the food-not so much. Octopus appetizer was a huge piece bread in a bowl of broth. We had to search for the octopus - 5 little pieces! My fish was over salted and dull. For the money I spent I was expecting to be wowed. Party of 4 and none of us were impressed.

Lovely restaurant with great views. If you can get a table where you can see the harbour all the better. Food also was great, menu is a bit limited and I would have preferred to have options such as a shellfish meal, but you have to order this on a platter. Service was also great and very engaging and friendly. So happy to recommend with some reservations. 

So many bourbons!

Went with family after having dinner next door at La Mar.Pleasant hostess did us a solid getting us a table without reservations.Very busy on a Friday night. I recommend reservations. Four and a half pages of single spaced bourbons and ryes, some from West coast of U.S. I'm from east coast, so I particularly loved the opportunity to try some of these. My daughters loved the champagne selection, and son and wife went for the craft cocktails.We'd already eaten, but food looked superb. A must-stop selection.Vibe is amazing. Right on the Embarcadero.

Waterbar is a very nice restaurant with an amazing view of the Bay Bridge all lit up at night. The food was good, albeit a little pricey (the again, what isn't in SF?!). My starter soup was tasty, but could have been warmer...the main course was also good, but not spectacular.

Great service, tasty food and outstanding view of the Bay.

Very well recommended restaurant and it was definitely a pleasant lunch. Very good food and interesting menu. Good drinks and good service. All tables have a view of the bridge(not golden gate, but very pretty)Fairly kid friendly and I would recommend and return for dinner when I'm back in town.

Outstanding views of the Bay bridge, inside and out. Unfortunately the food was marginal at best and WAAY overpriced.

I was at the restaurant with about a dozen people for a business outing. The service was fairly slow even though we were there early mid-week. The appetizers that we ordered were quite small and many people didn't get to try everything. Seems the server should be better prepared to recommend portions appropriate for a table of guests. My dish was a special - halibut on a corn husk with a southwestern coulis preparation. For $39, the portion was quite small, and the fish was dried out. I was surprised that a seafood restaurant would have trouble preparing fish correctly. Others at the table enjoyed the company and view far more than the food. Overall it was a "meh" place to eat. There are far better dinner values in San Francisco, stop by this place for dessert and pictures (even outside) but skip the meal.

We are a group of 8 and good thing we had reservation for a Friday night. This place is busy at 9:00pm.We were seated right away. The first thing that catches you before you even enter the restaurant is the awesome view of the bridge. All lit up and glorious to look at. We took a few pictures and the meal was equally fabulous. We all had different choices. Not one dish was amiss. The butter they put on the table was perfect. Room temperature, touch of sea salt, spreads well on the sourdough warm bread. We all love the butter!!! The service was spot on. Water filled every few minutes, our server had all the right answers to our questions. If you plan on going, make a reservation. Come at night time to get the full effect of the bridge with lights.

To start off, we made reservations for Waterbar, and they had a table waiting for us overlooking the Bay Bridge. That really set a fabulous tone! Everything I ate was delicious, and the variety of flavors within each appetizer, meal, and dessert was unique and well appreciated. The food was extremely fresh and cooked very well! And the service was great, too! I definitely recommend Waterbar.

My wife and I were on our honeymoon and were recommended Waterbar by some friends who had been previously. If you like seafood then Waterbar is definitely for you.The view of the Bay Bridge is fantastic - we sat next to a window looking out at it as the sun set. The lights at night on the bridge are very nice. The food was superb. We started off with some oysters and prawns. The selection of oysters is great with many bought in from all over the country. For main we had the halibut and the duck breast. The halibut was cooked to perfection and the duck was also very nice. It is quite highly priced but this is the norm for seafood and the location so this did not bother us. The last thing to mention is the service - it was probably the best service I have received at any restaurant in the world. The manager Leeann was absolutely lovely and went to extremes to ensure we had a nice dinner (and bought us a shot for dessert!). Waterbar was amazing.

We went here for a group dinner (200 of us). This restaurant is right by the water near the Bay Bride. They did an amazing job of serving our group. The appetizers were delectable as was the main course. We enjoyed short ribs or sea bass and no one was complaining. This would be a great spot for a romantic dinner, although I hear you have to reserve well in advance. During the evening, you get to enjoy the light show on the Bay Bridge.

We were recommended by our hotel to dine at this restaurant on the last night of our stay in San Francisco. My husband wanted seafood and our teenager wanted a view of the Harbor. This restaurant delivered on both these points. The location near the Oakland Bay Bridge was beautiful and the food was really good, especially the oysters. Inside the restaurant are two tubular- shaped fish tanks with beautiful fish! Nice touch. The issue we had was that it took an hour and three quarters to finally get our entrees from the time we finished our soup and salads. Although management sent over two additional appetizers almost an hour later (we were originally told that this was compliments of the hotel we were staying at, which was not the case), we still sat for another forty five minutes. Had we known that a long wait was usual for this restaurant, we would not have booked here since we were planning to leave for home by 5:00 am next morning. So, although the food is good, the atmosphere is lovely and the staff are polite, do plan on spending a few hours at the table if you go. This is a very busy place whose kitchen obviously could not handle the demand.

Classy restaurant with beautiful view. Great service. Fun drink specials and excellent wine list. Fabulous fresh oyster selection. First class dining experience. Seafood was fresh and well prepared. Had five guests and everybody had an outstanding meal. Crab salad appetizer was fabulous. In life you get what you pay for and while expensive it was worth every penny. Been to a lot of restaurants in San Fran and this was one of the best!

We booked a 5:30 table and glad we did as we had a great window seat with a view of the harbor. The restaurant filled quickly. We had the duck confit which was cooked just right with a sour berry sauce and a potato granita on a lentil sauce base. The other dish was Hawaiian Walu fish with chunks of lobster, baby carrots, gnocchi and greens in a broth. Both dishes were fabulous. We also had a side of sweet pea leaves and stems which were steamed, lightly salted and served with pine nuts. Had never eaten this before and it was great. A couple chocolates and espressos finished the meal. Nice decor, a bit noisy. Service was excellent.

After a full day touring San Francisco, we ended out day at here. Its a bit outta the way from the tourist places at Fisherman's Wharf ... a good 35 minute walk down the Embarcadero. However, they have excellent food, generous portions, and exceptionally good desserts which makes the walk worth it. It's a fine dining experience and a bit pricey. The wine lis tis extensive but overpriced compared to most places. The oyster bar is a specialty and a great place to meet even if you don't want a full meal.

Stopped in here for drinks and appetizers and decided to stay for dinner. Great place to spend some time enjoying the view and the libations. No reservation? No problem - outside seating and bar seating is first come first served, inside reservations required and book well in advance. Wait staff did a great job! The oysters were well presented, swordfish and steak were delicious. Hope to return!

Despite a late reservation (9 pm) our table was still not ready when we arrived and there was nowhere for us to wait, the bar was full. We had to wait in the aisle trying to avoid waitstaff and other customers, very awkward. When we were finally seated, in the back room, our waiter insisted on reciting a lecture on every course and could not answer a simple question without injecting his personal opinions, likes and dislikes, yet he had never heard of Russian dressing. the Dungeness crab was very fresh and the cocktail sauce had a perfect balance of tomato ketchup and horseradish. The swordfish was overcooked (it was ordered medium rare) and over-salted but was so thick that you could cut then salty crust away. The ahi tuna dish that our friend ordered looked very good and I would order that if I went back. We did not order dessert as it was quite late.

I had dinner (with reservations) last week at Waterbar, we got there on time and had to wait at the bar nearly 15 minutes, it was a little upsetting. After that, the dinner was good, we liked some dishes more than others, the short rib and the lobster were both fantastic, but found the restaurant to be a bit more expensive than it should be. Of course, the bay view is the highlight.

The best attraction is the view without a doubt. The oysters were also a must try for some local flavor. I sat at the bar near the window and found this to be a great sit to enjoy a great seen both indoor and out. The bartender was very knowledgeable and recommend fantastic food and wine options. It can be a tourist trap as the prices are slightly over priced, but I enjoyed the night.
