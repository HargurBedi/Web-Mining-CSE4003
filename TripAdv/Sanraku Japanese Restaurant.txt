Really enjoyed our lunch at Sanraku. The hamachi sushi was delicious. There were so many tempting choices on the menu that it was hard to choose and we were both very pleased with our choices. The calm of the restaurant was very pleasant and very Japanese. We will be sure to eat here again on our next visit to San Francisco.

If you like sushi and try to search in San Francisco for the best...you will find many very good places. That said, you owe it to yourself to find Sanraku and even if there is a line, wait long enough to dine here. You will find the staff to be very professional, the Chefs to be highly skilled and the sushi beyond compare. Excellent. It will be on your 'must' list from that point forward!

I like any restaurant that is loaded with locals. It bodes well for the quality and service in my book. We ordered a number of rolls to bring back to the hotel and have a quiet night after a lot of walking. Great tasting, fully fresh sushi. And the service was fantastic with a reasonable price.

Booked a table for 7 pm. It was not ready. We had to wait for nearly 20 minutes for other diners to finish eating to get our table. From the minute we sat down we were made aware that they wanted our table for another party at 8 pm. Those people arrived and then stood and stared at us making it very uncomfortable for us . While the food was okay the crowded atmosphere was horrible. And having our plates taken away almost while we were still eating was very poor. As was getting the check while we were still deciding whether we wanted anything else to eat. This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner. Sadly it was a just horrible. Won't be back.

Nice restaurant, good professional service and great Sushi. We shared the sushi & sashimi platter which comes with a salad and miso soup. The soup was lovely, much better than we tasted in The Netherlands. We also had the Futomaki and the Sanraku Special roll. All sushi and sashima was freshly made and tasted fantastic. Adding 2 glasses of wine and we had a great dinner.

Sanraku is probably one of the best overall sushi places I've ever been to. We went there on a Wednesday night for dinner and it was already very busy. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table as we didn't have a reservation, but the food was definitely worth the wait.I was so happy when we saw Onikoroshi sake on the menu (this is my ultimate favorite Sake and I've had many, many different kinds before), so we ordered a glass each of this. For our food we ordered three kinds of sashimi: Chu Toro (fatty blue fin tuna), Hamachi Toro (yellowtail belly), and Hon Maguro (blue fin tuna). The sashimi was especially fresh and delicious, especially the Chu Toro which felt like it was melting in my mouth. We also ordered a couple of rolls, the spicy trio roll and volcano roll. For those of you that have seen my other sushi restaurant reviews, you'll know that I love very spicy rolls. Both rolls were phenomenal in taste, although the roll itself was a little small in diameter (probably about 3/4 of an inch instead of the 1 inch that I am used to). The Spicy Trio roll was my favorite between the two, with blue fin tuna as the fish, and in the roll itself was cucumber, avocado, and wasabi pickles, topped with jalapenos. The flavors really mixed well together and the jalapenos and tobiko sauce just made the roll perfectly spicy! Definitely would go back to this place again. I highly recommend making reservations as this place gets really busy.

Some of the dishes did not arrive until we asked about them.

I had very high expectations in general regarding the sushi in San Fransisco. I am a tourist and this was my third time in the city. Although the sushi here was good, I would not qualify it as great nor the restaurant as a must.If you want good quality sushi with reasonably fast service with either some sake or craft japanese beer, then this is the place. The ambiance and the sushi isn't flashy nor very creative.

Went there for dinner without reservation but the restaurant was very busy. I was lucky to get a seat at the bar after 15 minutes wait.Ordered the set menu as it's easier for one person. The set had sashimi and teriyaki salmon, and both were ok, but nothing exceptional. In my opinion definitely not "the best sushi or sashimi ever" nor is it exceptional. However it's not an expensive restaurant, set dinner is just US$20ish. Think quality of food is ok at this price range.

Based on this restaurant's ratings I had high expectations. Food was good, not great. Service was BAD. We were clearly forgotten about as 15 min after someone took our order someone else came over and asked if we were ready to order. Tables around us received their dinners before we got our soup and then were told "he must have forgot". Not what I expected for an expensive restaurant. My sushi place in PA is much better than here.

Seeing that it had a very high rating online, and knowing we were in San Francisco, I expected amazing and innovative sushi for my birthday dinner. While it was solid, there was nothing new, interesting or exceptional about the sushi here. We live in central Texas and have at least 3 restaurants in our town that taste fresher, which came as quite a shock to me. The atmosphere was, again, unexceptional, and the service was moderately poor.

We didn't book, so it's our fault at the first place but they still managed to offer us a table and requested one hour to finish and we were ok with it because we were always quick to finish our meal. I think they are more specialized on sushi because our hot dishes were really average especially my order of salmon was overlooked and very dry and tough to chew. For a restaurant with this reputation should not take care of food so lightly even they want to serve more customers with little time to concentrate on cooking. I can not fault their service but food quality is the number one priority for a restaurant and I didn't get that impression.

We dropped by without a reservation last night and were after 5 minutes were given a table. Ordered some drinks and shortly after ordered our starters and mains. The food came out gradually and was all delicious. Portion sizes were fairly big as well which I was not expecting. In the end I ended up leaving some amazing sesame chicken as I just had no room left. I would recommend the dinner combination as it's great value for money and covers all the food you might enjoy like sushi and also meat. Overall a lovely meal and attentive staff.

Honestly speaking the California version with all the mayonnaise is better for your mind and your soul then for your hips. Oh sorry this is a review on not a food blog...Sanraku is a typical Japanese restaurant with sushi. The style gets 3 out of 10. The service is 7. The food and the people are a 10.Everything always fresh tasting from the sea and serving very fast. Not a place to go for a date. A Place to have safe good food... however the carpet inside needs to be refurbished......a safe place for a fast food...not a place to stay the whole evening...

We picked Sanraku after reviewing the stellar reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. Initially we had a reservation for 8:00 pm and called to change it to an earlier time. Little did I know that there are multiple locations in the San Francisco are and the listing in the internet was NOT the one where I had made my original reservation. So beware.... English is not the primary language for most of the folks who work here. Thankfully Linda recognized our situation almost immediately after we showed up an hour before our official, first reservation and was able to accommodate us. The food and the service lived up to all the stellar reviews on Trip Advisor (and I spent a year in Japan). The folks here are very friendly and the fish quality is superb. I would definitely return and thanks again to Linda for your pleasant personality and accommodating us!

We have been directed to Sanraku by a local Japanese and we did not regret it. Yes, it's not a cheap sushi place, yet it's not over the top expensive. Portions are nice size and everything we had was very fresh. We tried 10 different nigiri, plus some sashimi, couple of special appetizers (which were very good) plus had an excellent sake (Hakutsuru) at reasonable price. Service was at just a right pace (not too fast). Place is relatively small, yet we never felt overcrowded. Overall, while it wasn't as good as Takashi in SLC, it was a very much recommended place for fans of sushi.

A really good Japanese restaurant: I have spent time in Tokyo and my Tokyo friends tell me that San Francisco is one of the few cities outside of Japan where you can get good Japanese food, and Sanraku does not disappoint. Non high end Japanese restaurants in Tokyo are usually about food rather than ambiance, and plain is a good sign , and Sanraku is plain; but comfortable and relaxing. Still its the food that counts , and here we have tasty toro , moresish sashimi ,crispy tempura, tangy teriyaki. Just a good place especially for the price

I arrived around 12:20pm and ordered 4 maki rolls. I waited 30 minutes for my rolls. The restaurant wasn't completely full, but the wait staff was non-stop busy like last time I went. I was a bit bothered by the long wait. If I didn't have my phone to distract me, it would have been a problem. However, once I got back to my office and started eating, I completely forgot about the wait. Delicious. I will go again. I just wish I could order over the phone or online in order to avoid the long wait.

Yes, the sushi and maki rolls were indeed excellent and very fresh. And when you see the many Japanese people eating there you know the food must be good. So why not the maximum rating: mostly because of the uninspiring 'canteen-like' setting. Although this is certainly not uncommon in Japan as well it was a bit too basic for me. Tip: although you strictly speaking do not need a reservation it is advisable (certainly for larger groups).

We waited about 15 minutes for a table at 9:00 on a Tuesday night. After ordering our food - the service was minimal - we didn't see our server much after that. Two people - one app, chicken udon, two rolls and two drinks all for $70.00. We had an unusual experience with the bill. When they brought the check to our table they said the credit card machine was down and asked for us to pay in cash. We didn't have cash. The staff said "ok, we will run the credit card the old fashion way". Then when we got the credit card and receipt back it was processed electronically with the "chip". We thought this was a little unusual and we overheard them say this to several tables. If the credit card machine was down why could they all of a sudden run the credit card with the chip? Interesting to say the least.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed two roles...one special with Tuna and the Salmon Crunch. Both rolls were delicious, with the Salmon being the stand out. Nice presentation, fresh fish, lunch specials and combinations. Only wish I was hungry to try more!

I'm a bit of a sushi snob but I'd put this place in my top five, and I've been to Japan a couple times. We ordered the Sakura option which is a bit more of a top-shelf omakase experience. We also had some of the best o-toro I've ever tasted, smooth as butter. Best meal we had in San Francisco, did not expect it to be this good. 

Good Value, Curt Service

Don't go to Sanraku looking for TLC. The service is abrupt and no-nonsense, but it is efficient. Clearly the staff was trying to move people in and out during the lunch hour.That's fine, because the food was well worth it. For $11, I got a heaping plate of chicken teriyaki, preceded by a small salad and bowl of miso soup (tip: don't expect a spoon; drink from the bowl). My companion got several sushi rolls, which he enjoyed.If you want a great value for solid Japanese food, and you don't mind not having a solicitous waiter, this is a good bet.

Sushi good, miso not so much

I had the miso soup and crunch roll, skip the soup and just get the roll. It's a small place, but at 4:10 on a Wednesday we got right in.

As a woman travelling for business this restaurant was perfect for me. The service was quick and friendly and the sushi was the best I've ever tasted. Highly recommend the sashimi and sushi platter 

a delightful dinner

Busy Lunch Spot - Great Sushi and Sashimi

I arrived at 12:30pm for a lunchtime business meeting. The place was very full with little room to walk and this caused some issues for the servers. One server bumped our table and our server spilled some tea while delivering it to the table. The servers just need a bit more mindfulness. Despite how busy the place was, the food came fast and it was very good. I ordered the Sake Nigiri Sushi and the Eskimo Roll. Both were excellent.

Traditional Japanese right in heart of SF!

We walked down the block and spied this jewel, thought we'd try it, lots of people inside already enjoying their food. Oh my, it was a crown jewel. Specialty drinks, memorable soda from Japan, great choices, wonderful appetizers!We went back twice more and tried other dishes, too bad we were only in town for a week.

Amazing food, good lunch deals

We had a bento box at lunch time and it was really good. I had a vegetarian version and staff were nice to accommodate my needs. It's very good value for the price you pay and also tasty!

Good sushi, fresh, and good service. Yellow tail tuna carpacchio was delicious appetizer. Pricey but no more so than anywhere else in SF. Decent servings. 

Decent Japanese food at decent prices in the city

We were surprised we were able to get a table so quickly on a Saturday night. Ordered an appetizer, sushi, and a combination dinner and it was more than enough food for two people. If I recall, we ordered the special clam karaage and it was just so-so. The sushi deluxe (10 pieces plus 6 pieces of California roll) was fresh and had a decent portion size of fish. The combo dinner consisted of a tasty salmon and tempura plus miso soup, salad, and rice. Nice service and atmosphere!

Excellent food and service

Not the most appealing establishment on the outside; but it's magic on the inside. We made reservations for 8PM on a Saturday. Place was jumping. We were seated near the front of the restaurant at a small two top table. Waitress was kind, and pretty on point. We got the combo meals. It came with 4 pieces of sushi and then salmon teriyaki as the entree. Sushi was fantastic, and the salmon teriyaki was cooked to perfection. Besides the lack of atmosphere everything else was perfect, I will definitely be back on my next trip to San Fran. 

Straightforward good Japanese

Went with a group who love this place for sushi. As I did not want sushi I ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempura and the beef udon. Both were excellent. The tempura was crispy and cooked well; the beef in the udon was particularly good - thick slices very generous and tender as well.

Excellent Japanese

We went here with the kids. Food was excellent, with great choices for everyone. Food served quickly and with a smile. Flavors are authentic and fresh. I can recommend the katsudon, the tempura plate and the mixed sushi. All were nicely put together and very tasty.

Found this little restaurant last year and on returning was just as delighted with the food, service. Small restaurant or sit at the bar and watch the chefs make the sushi up - excellent set lunch with choices for most sushi lovers with miso soup - pick your own bento box basically - excellent price and ongoing tea

Great lunch spot

Fast and yummy. SF roll is great, Bento boxes split well for kids. Two Bento plus a roll fed a family of four lunch. The green tea is amazing. The chicken teriyaki is filling.
