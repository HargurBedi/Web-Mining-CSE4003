This was our third time at Tony's. The pizza and service is always amazing. The location is fabulous and if you get a table outside and the sun is beating down on you, you are blessed.This time we tried a smaller pizza, which we were thankful for as we always have so many leftovers with some of the larger ones. It is a little pricey but its well worth it to have an amazing slice of za. I highly recommend getting here for a meal if you are in the City.

Such a sour reception in the city of lights!

Jetlagged and a little confused, we arrived at the restaurant asking directions as to where to order a fabulous take-away ... holycrapymoly ... did we run into the personification of a bad attitude 'welcoming' guests ... pretty brown-eyed girl trying to stare down someone who could have been her mother with a Simpson-family look, complete with rolling eyes and pauses. Totally disrespectful and I am happy did not raise her or have to work with or around her. Honeybun, lighten up! You are not the centre of the universe and not an asset to your workplace. Ps ... we found the place, no thanks to you and the pizza was fabulous!

This was our last meal before heading out to the airport and we saved the best for last! If you can, sit at the bar for a full experience, especially if Robvel is the bartender. Robvel has been with Tony since the beginning and he will not disappoint. He made us feel right at home, giving us a couple of complimentary meatballs to begin our experience. He described the whole pizza menu to us. Tony's has 7 different pizza ovens to suit your fancy. Yes, you may wait a bit for the pizza, but you won't be disappointed. Just grab a fantastic cocktail from Robvel, be patient and enjoy!

Visited last week due to the good reviews we had read. Went at 8pm but restaurant was still full so had to come 2 hours later. This was great for us and as we wanted to try the food we didn't mind waiting. It is easy to access as it is just off a bus route and there are several bars around the area to have a drink before food. There was lots to choose from and lots of different types of pizza, even if you were a vegetarian.The service was good, although they were really busy and the staff were friendly, overall the food was reasonably priced. Well worth a visit, some of the best pizza I have ever had

What a great experience in Little Italy in SF! Quaint Pizza place that has won awards. Our pizza had a great unique flavor on a standard pizza. The Tony's beer was awesome and the staff was above great. Couldn't be any better. Great outdoor seating as well to watch people and enjoy the SF experience!

Have been wanting to try out Tony's for a while but you know how it gets with the huge lines and their 1.5 hours wait especially on weekends :( Ugh!!! I hate SF city only for the silly lines! Let us eat people ;)We found the perfect trick though - put your name down and go hang out in the city do some close by sightseeing (Ina Coolbrith park or Coit Tower) and roam around for that miserable 1 hour and something and come back ready to eat the best damn pizza in town. You heard me!We got lucky with our plan and it worked out perfectly because they messaged us saying our table was ready as we were walking right in. I was too happy!!!We didn't want to wait extra time to be seated outside (which is perfect on hot days as it gets quite hot inside due to the wood fired ovens) so we opted for inside seating. Who cares about the heat when I'm lucky enough to try Tony's pizza? Move over!!!Our waitress was super friendly and bathrooms were pretty decent and clean so all that checked out!Between the 4 of us we shared:- Margarita pizza (only 73 a day)- Diavola (the best!!!)- Marinara (could pass on it)Let me tell you about how much i loved the pizzas. The dough was thin, that beautiful red sauce had the homemade taste and those toppings were the shizzle! Pizzas were soooo light I cannot get over it. Simple and clean taste, just how I like it. I must go to Napoli now and find out if they make better pizza than Tony :PJokes aside, you must try Tony's at least once if you come prepared for the wait strategy.Tony Amore Ti Amo Tanto! A Presto!!!

I came alone and was sat at the bar. Watching the bartender work that day was amazing! He was meticulous and tried each drink to make sure it tastes right. I was impressed. I ordered the jersey style with the sausage. A basic pizza with just the right flavours making a basic thing taste amazing!! I highly recommend this dish. The pizzas are large. Be mindful of how many in your party and people willing to share. Most are marked that they feed 2-4 people. I picked mine as it didn't and I still couldn't finish it. I highly recommend this place!

I waited an hour for my postmates delivery. Pizza and even the box were COLD. I called to try to speak with a manager and was given the cold shoulder by the receptionist who didn't even want to patch me through to the manager. She abruptly said "you need to call the delivery company" and "he'll tell you the same thing". It seems like this happens quite a bit. If you don't value your customers enough to pick up the phone and address issues, you shouldn't be in business. Waste of $30. There's plenty of restaurants in SF. Try somewhere else.

My boyfriend and I went here on our last day in San Fran (on vacation from Vancouver) and WOWZA! We got a salad and the New Yorker pizza and it was more than enough for both of us (actually we took some on the plan back home. The pizza is fresh, crust is on point, and they make HOME MADE RICOTTA FOR THE PIZZA!!! Would happily return upon our next visit to San Fran.One quick note - there is usually a long wait for this place, but you can leave your number and go walk around in the Italian district until your table is ready (they'll text you to let you know when). Definitely prepare to go hungry, but also prepare to wait!!!

We've been to San Francisco three times and this was the first time we've been able to score a table at Tony's. It was well worth the wait though. The biggest problem is trying to get a table - they don't take reservations and everyone in your party needs to be in situ before you can put your name down for a table. We rocked up at 5.30 on a Thursday night and got a table straight away. The range of pizzas is mind boggling but in the end we went for a Gold Medal Coal Fired New Yorker and it was fabulous from the crust to the topping. Service was great and there was a really bustling vibe. Can't wait to go back next time we're in town!

All in the great fall sunshine on the patio. Lots of good people watching. Definitely do not miss this place if you are in North Beach.

I'm italian and from Naples exactly, so I've tried many pizzas in my life. Quality in general is not bad at all, considering how far SF is from Naples,the pizza is not bad but...rest of the menu, specially the pastas, are defo not Italians at all. Most of the pizzas on the menu do not exist in Italy and let me tell you that 60$ for 2 pizzas is extremely expensive!!

The reviews are true, the pizza was GOOD! We shared the New Yorker and a few wines for lunch. I'm assuming everything else is just as good. The maitre d who initially showed us to our table was a bit 'interesting' - she was completely disinterested. However our waiter was excellent and the service was great from then on. We only had to line up for a short time but I would imagine it would get really busy at times as it's so popular. Would recommend it.

Being from New Haven county, I'm a bit of a pizza snob. I'm very critical of my pizza, and I'm harsh. However, this place was surprisingly good. We were able to watch our pizza get cooked in front of us, so it was a great atmosphere. Our waiter was wonderful, and also an east coast native, so we had a nice discussion and gave us his recommendations for food and wine. A+ on the service.Because we were from the New Haven area, we both decided not to go with the New Haven style, as we would probably compare it too much and be too critical. We went with the two award winning pizzas - the Margherita, and the Cal Italia, and also an order of meatballs because they were smaller pizzas. We ate everything and drank an entire bottle of wine. The dough was cooked perfectly! I'm still particular to my hometown's sauce, but it was pretty good here. I was shocked how much I enjoyed the Cal Italia because I usually don't like sweeter pies. And the Margherita is a must.I still can't say it's better than New Haven pizza, but you probably can't get a better pizza in San Francisco anywhere. Everything about this place was fantastic and I will definitely return to try more pizzas.

The most over rated pizza joint ever. After waiting 30 mins for a table the waiter had such a bad attitude we should have left right there. After another 15 mins we got water and were told "your drinks are coming when I get a minute." We got them and they were WRONG. Ordered our pizzas ($39 for one) and when they arrived they 25 mins later they were WRONG. one was to have extra cheese and anchovies and it had NEITHER! Save your time and definitely save your money! Go elsewhere. Oh, we made our displeasure about the atrocious service very clear to the waiter with tip. Want a good tip, prove good service.

By far the best pizza restaurant we have ever been in. This is not your usual pizza joint, some amazing and unusual pizzas on offer cooked in one of their seven ovens all of which cook in different ways. The lady who greeted us and showed us to our table must have been having a bad day but after that the service was quick, very proficient, slick and the staff could not have been more friendly or welcoming. We had two types of pizza both were superb. If you are visiting San Francisco you must pay a visit to Tony's.

No matter where you are from and what type of pizza you like, you will find a slice here to your liking. They have every style of pizza you can think of. My husband is from New Jersey so maybe it's no big surprise that both of us loved the New Jersey Tomato Pie. We also had the calamari and the garlic bread, both loved by the entire family including the kids. We tried the American pizza as well. Although it was good, just not my kind of pizza. We ate here twice during our stay in San Fran! I agree with the other reviewers, we were given a wait time of 45 minutes and we were seated in 35 minutes. Yes, the service is not refined or super friendly, but it's a great pizza joint and that's why it's so crowded..popular for a reason. Awesome atmosphere and good bartenders. Wish I had one here in Washington DC! If only I could get my hands on their recipe?!

Went to Tony's after hearing a friend rave about it. Was not disappointed. We knew the popularity so we got there about 15 minutes before it opened on a Saturday (it opened at 12). Already a line of about 30 people. Once it opened we were seated within 15 minutes. We ordered the meatballs and the Spicy Grandma pizza. The meatballs were incredible, and I'm not even a huge fan of meatballs. But the showstopper was the Spicy Grandma. They only make about 10 of these a day I believe. The sauce on this pizza was so unique but absolutely delicious. If you have the chance, get this pizza. So good! Expensive for a pizza, but so worth it. We had enough leftovers for both of us to eat lunch the next day! Can't say enough good things about Tony's. I will be dreaming about the next time I can go back!

Read about Tony's in a guide book and went to check it out. Hostess advised us it was a long wait but we were then able to be seated right away outside (raining and cold, but heaters were on so all ok). Two of us had burratina di margherita and garlic bread, which were amazing, but we couldn't finish it all. Went back 2 nights later and had Detroit with red top - also amazing! Wish we lived locally so we could check out other yummy sounding pizzas on their menu...

I read all the reviews about Tony's and had to check it out. The wait was nearly 2 hours, even on a mid week night, however they take your cell phone # and text you when the table is ready, so we wandered around the North Beach neighborhood rather than stand in line.They have lots of pizza choices -- wood, gas, electric and coal ovens and choices of crust and toppings. We had a coal-filed NY pizza. The sausage and pepperoni were obviously house-made or made by a local and were unbelievably good. The crust on this pizza was paper thin and crispy. I could have done without the dollops of ricotta, I'd ask them to hold that next time.We sat outside, which was cold even with heaters in late July. Mark Twain was right. We had to wait 6 minutes to get the hostesses attention while she politely dealt with an a-hole who had asked for first available rather than inside and thought he deserved to be seated inside ahead of those who specified inside. Kn my fantasy world I would have grabbed him and tossed him into the street 2 minutes ibto his tirade. Folks, if you want an inside table don't ask for first available.

we checked in with hostess and left our cell #. were told "at least an hour and a half wait" that we would be texted when table ready. We asked if we could go somewhere and come back "yes, you have at least an hour and a half before you even get the text". We ask how far We can go "go wherever you want" We walked about 10-15 mins down the street to get a drink. 25 minutes after checking in at Tonys, I get a text that we have 5 minutes to get back or my table will be given up. I try calling, no answer. We settle the bill and walk back (25min from text). Our table has been given away, which I understand fully. They say we will be at end of the list. I explain that we were told we could leave. That we were told it would be at least 90 minutes, not 28. That I called when I got the text, etc. Finally she said she would try to help, and after a 10 min. wait we got a table. I was fully understanding I would need to wait again,I just didn't think we should get put to the bottom of the list. We ordered the New York pizza. It was very good, notably that the crust could hold up the heavy toppings and didn't soak through. Excellent, friendly service from our waitress

It took us two tries to get in for dinner - both times on a Saturday and Sunday night took two hours of being wait-listed. We got put on a call list from our hostess so we were able to do some more shopping in the area. We finally got in on Sunday night. Service was friendly and good - recommendations were excellent. Wine selection was good and paired well with the pizzas. We shared two of the award winners - Cal Italia and the New Yorker - both were fantastic. We also shared the house specialty friend dough with sea salt as an appetizer. There was plenty of food and lots left over so we had no room for dessert. The restaurant is not fancy and is always busy so prepare to be waitlisted for a significant time but it is worth it. The menu has something to appeal to everyone and despite being a hopping place, the staff do not rush you.

This pizza restaurant is named in the Eyewitness guide Top Ten: San Francisco so we thought we'd try it as we walked back from Fishermen's Wharf area.If you want good pizza this is for you. We ordered Tartufo, a delicious topping of goat cheese, wild mushrooms, prosciutto di Parma and arugula. It was served quickly by a friendly waiter. Other diners' choices looked very appetising.If you want a nice setting this is maybe not for you. We were seated in a cafe-like area, with tables crammed close together, and so cold by the open door that we wore our coats. We didn't linger for a second drink or dessert.

I've been to Tony's numerous times, and as far as I'm concerned, you can't beat this place for location, great quality, consistency, and variety. Tony's is walking distance from the FiDi, the Embarcadero, Chinatown, and Fisherman's Wharf. They offer 12 different styles of pizza, as well as salads, meatballs, pasta, and calzones. There can be a bit of a wait for a table, but you can order food at the bar - first come, first serve. There is a full bar with decent taps (Anchor California, Fort Point, and Lagunitas are always offered), and the bar staff is friendly and attentive. Highly recommended!

We went to eat here because of the Yelp ratings and were not disappointed. They do not take reservations and the wait was 2 hours but we had Sangria and waited to see if something opened at the bar, which it did. The bartenders were amazing at service (best I have ever had as a matter a fact) they make amazing drinks, the food was fabulous- great pizaa and homemade pasta. Overall a great Italian place to eat. If I lived there I would be a frequent vistors.

Ate at the bar on a recent trip and had the most amazing experience. The bar tender guided us through the extensive pizza menu featuring at least 3 different oven types, gas coal and wood--never seen this before! He also offered us a wine tasting and some complimentary meatballs which were simply amazing. The pizza was absolute perfection and I would place it in the top 3 in America with Pepe's in new haven, and Lombardi's in NYC--its that good!

Amazing pizza, well worth the long queues

We visited Tony's twice during our stay in San Francisco - you often have to queue for 1-2 hours but it's well worth the wait and there are a few other bars across the street to get a drink in whilst you wait. The service was friendly, atmosphere cosy and the menu is the most extensive pizza menu we'd seen - absolutely delicious and good for breakfast the next day too!! Definitely worth a visit.

Just as described, great pizza. Cooked perfectly in the coal oven. Met two nice couples eating dinner as well.

We stopped in for a late lunch, and even though there was a line outside we were able to quickly get seats at the bar. Service was special, we took recommendations from the bartender for meatballs, margherita pizza and wine. The food and wine pairing was spectacular, meeting/exceeding anything we've had in the US or Italy. Hats off to the chef and our bartender! 

Decent Margherita pizza but really expensive

As we were staying close by, we ordered a take-out meal, deciding that waiting for a table in the restaurant would not be fun.We ordered the Margherita and the Sicilian. I can't believe how expensive these pizzas are!At first I couldn't find the takeout place as it's a separate entity from the restaurant. Then, as I waited to collect my pies, a delivery driver who entered after me decided he needed to go first. Not cool.Anyhoo - we got the pies and took them home. The Margherita was tastey but was it the best ever? No! I do prefer its thin crust however, as compared to the Sicilian, which was a rectangular, thick-crust pizza. It was a disappointment.Probably won't be eating at Tony's again.

We stopped to get a slice when we were taking a break from our Segway tour. Our family shared two slices (4 cheese and Margherita I believe). The slices were about $5.50 each. IT WAS DELICIOUS! The crust was perfect as well! I can definitely say this was the most delicious pizza I have ever had.

My hubby and I were visiting San Francisco and were told Tony's was the place to go for great pizza. So we walked over a mile after a long day to give it a try. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and the infamous Margarita pizza. They only make so many Margarita pizzas per day, so it has to be awesome, right? Wrong! It was about a 12" very thin crust pizza with little sauce and what appeared to be clumps of mozzarella sporadically positioned on the top. $23. It was also burnt and cold! How does that happen? When the server asked how it was, we told him it was burnt and he said that was normal. What? Guess San Francisco style pizza is not for us! He did ask if we wanted something else, but we declined. Oh! They also do not have proper wine glasses. They served wine in a hi-ball glass. 

Literally the worst attitude I've ever witnessed

We stopped in for just a small bite to eat, not that hungry. Decided to order just a smaller pizza between a few of us. Never in my life have I witnessed a server act as angry and disgusted that we would only order one single $30 pizza. He shook his head and stormed away, returned to provide cutlery and other stuff, and despite us remaining polite - he refused to speak with us. Ridiculous 

Perfect for lunch

Great recommendation from concierge for pizza! The restaurant is authentic Italian and delish! The New Yorker pizza was thin crust, sausage, roni, and homemade ricotta - so good! If you are looking for anything Italian this place is the real deal!

Native Michigander, grew up on Buddy's Detroit pizza, made in the auto workers steel pans. in fact had a Detroit pie for my last birthday, in Detroit, on Conant, and it was just as it always is (perfect!) moved to San Francisco over 25 years ago and discovered Tony's in North Beach creates a Detroit pie, which i have had many times, turned on many groups/friends to, more birthday celebrations. i am even a long time fan of Brown Dog Pizza in Telluride, CO; a former U of M football player who makes a mean Detroit pie. Returned to Tony's w/my sister on a weds. night craving our detroit pie, put our names in and went for drinks in the neighborhood, fully expecting the hour to hour and a half wait. i have worked in North Beach on Columbus Ave. for over three years and I know the summer tourist traffic and I'm very realistic, however 2 hours later no text, we went back (my sister insisted, i said let's not bother them, they're busy) we were told that they had texted us, although i had only received the initial text two hours before. we were quickly seated at an available spot outside, it was sf summer cold, but then came the big blow; the server announced they had been out of Detroit pizza since 4 PM (it was after 8) i was devastated. yes, i should've asked about availability, but this has never happened before. if you run out of a popular pie , shouldn't you notify people before they sign up for an hour and a half (2hr)wait? The server kindly offered us alternatives but they paled by comparison to my beloved Detroit. i cannot return to Tony's, something has been breached here. if you google 'best pizza in sf' you will find a few excellent alternatives (albeit none serve Detroit), none with the insane wait at Tony's, which , until tonight, has been worth it.

Pizza is great and service is stellar!

During our last stop to San Francisco we stopped by this place to have some pizza. The pizza was absolutely fantastic. What really sealed the deal was the bartender Robvell. You can tell that Robvell is a people person and loves his job. We loved the way he broke it down for us and helped us order our pizza and drinks. His drinks were top notch and made with care. The next time we are in town we will for sure stop by!

A local who we met on the street recommended this place and he was spot on. Great pizza and the calamari was some of the best we have have had. Jose at the bar was wonderful. Be prepared to wait, but well worth it.

Came here based upon reviews and arrived at 4:00. A very rude hostess stated that they do not seat anyone from 4:00 to 4:30????? We walked around a bit but still decided to come back and waited in line. Once we were seated it was worth it as the pizza's we had were very good and outside of the normal.

Our only regret is that found this place on our last day in town and that I only have a family of 4 if not I would have had an excuse to try more that one of their award winning pies. When you see the menu and read that each type of pizza may have a different oven temperature, oven fuel (wood, coal, gas) and dough composition it may sound like overkill but on your first bite you'll correct yourself and know that it was absolutely necessary. Have your first SF meal here so you have time to come back.

On a Wednesday night you wouldn't think a 2 hour wait would be happening but it was. So we decided to wait but try the other pizza across the street, do our own tapas with pizza. So 1.5 hours later we got to eat the best meatballs I have ever eaten. With the best margarita pizza I have ever had. Regardless of the wait go to this place!!! 

Normal pizza!

We went in the afternoon to "Tony "and had a nice place without reservation. Outside you have the best seats, the air is not so bad as inside.There is a good variety of pizzas and the quality is OK, but not more then that. If I take into account the prices my expectation was not met.The staff is friendly and qualified.In many tourist guides I read a lot about this place but most is execerated and not conform my experiences.The bottom of the pizzas is too thick and the overall taste has not much to do with italian food.Therefor I do see no reason to go there again knowing that SF has a lot of better italian places in a better surounding.

Fantastic pizza, lots to choose from including Gluten Free

Recommended by a work colleague who has been here before. Didn't disappoint the food was awesome, everyone was happy with their choices. If you like pizza you have to go here. We went around 1pm on a Weds and only had a 30 min wait for a table which we sat outside in the sunshine in Washington Park. Perfect!

The pizza is absolutely yummy. You can choose different types of it according to the cooking style you want or prefer. The place is obviously full most of the times but it is totally worth either wait or sit at the bar. Please visit and make sure to hang around Little Italy too :)

High quality ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes) and wood oven make Pizza here really great. Beware not all pizzas are made the same so I recommend the one I tried which was margherita napoletana. Recommend also salads. Espresso could have been better. Great service, ambiance is OK. Recommended.

A two hour wait? You bet!

We heard Tony's had good pie and as a guy who has had his share in the US and abroad I had to check it out. Showed up on a Saturday evening to a two hour wait - normally I would not, but it's pizza. They took our cell number and we left for a walk. Eventually got in and it was great-nice staff, good drinks, and killer pizza. Thin crispy crust, big variety, good appetizers, even gluten free options.Definitely return.

This place was outstanding! As out-of-towners, my husband and I decided to risk it and try to sneak in a table at Tony's on a Saturday night. When we arrived, our hostess told us it would be a two and a half hour wait, but the bar area is first come, first serve. Tip: Wait by the bar! Something WILL come open! A wonderful older couple saw us patiently waiting and gave us their seats within 30 minutes of us getting to the restaurant. (I saw everyone that waited for a seat get a seat by the end of our visit.) The couple next to us got the New Yorker pizza, which looked and smelled like the most heavenly pizza known to man. We ordered a glass of IPA, a glass of Cab wine, three meatballs, and the New Yorker- all so delicious. The New Yorker has the best sausage/pepperoni combination I've had. Its huge- my husband and I couldn't finish it together. I would highly recommend it! Our bar service was outstanding and helped to make the experience great. We will be back to Tony's when we return to San Francisco.

My husband and I went to Tony's for lunch after a tip from a Lyft driver - we were so happy we did! We got there at 1230 and were quoted a 45 minute wait, which we were fine with, they will text you when your table is ready, but you must claim your table within 5 minutes of receiving the text, so don't wander too far. After perusing the menu, which is a bit overwhelming given all the oven choices (yes, each group of pies is sorted into oven type and cooking temperature categories), we asked our server for a recommendation and he quizzed is about preferences and then gave us category suggestions. We decided on the Coal Fired New Haven Lou, which has a thin but flexible crust that is a bit charred on the bottom, topped with ricotta, buffalo mozzarella, spinach, garlic, and crushed red pepper - it was so good! Keep in mind that not all pizzas are available all day, for example the margarita is limited to about 75 pies a day. We took the cable car down to Hyde St in the late morning and the walked along the wharf; Tony's is about an 8 block walk directly up from Pier 39 (only 2-3 manageable hills along the walk). The atmosphere is lively, but not loud; the space inside is small, but there is also some outdoor seating available too. I highly recommend and will return here should my travels ever bring me back to San Fransisco.

The girls at the entrance did not even greet us, simply noded and impatientlly waited for me to speak. Bad start.Asked us to wait for 90 minutes and come back which we did, they then seated us in the back of the restaurant, last table back to the wall of the kitchen but wasn't that bad. The red wine we ordered came warm....we had to have it chilled, weird that it is not in a cellar. We ordered 2 pizza's and 6 meat balls for 4 people, was plenty. The waiter suggested 1 pizza per person, doesn't make sense, it's a 12 inch pizza sliced into 8 pieces....who eats 8 pieces of pizza? The pizza is HIGHLY overrated, DON'T wait 90 mts, go to others just around the corner who will probably have a smile and be happy to have your business when you walk in. Disappointed.

Adorable!

Our waiting time to get in was about 20 min, so we decided to hang out around Washington sq. The place was very busy and full, luckily we gots large table at the window. Kids chose favorite classics - Margherita. My wife and me opts for some "less usual". All of them were great. We spent 5 years in Italy and know a couple of things about pizzas. This was really good. Service was not at its best, but reasonable given the amount of guests. Recommended. I would definitely come back.

This Pizza is not only the best pizza I've ever eaten in any city but the best food we had in San Francisco. We enjoyed the New Yorker 16 inch and a 12 inch custom. Great service! Only a 15 minute wait for lunch. Staff was knowledgeable about local area.
