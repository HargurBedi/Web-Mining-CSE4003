Breakfast in America

It used to be said of England, my home place, that, if you wanted to eat well there, the solution was to have breakfast three times a day. It might well be true of the U.S. now. Outside of Michelin starred restaurants, the best meals we've had in the U.S. have been in places like this. And this is one of the best of the best. The ambience is casual, welcoming and friendly. The staff are wonderfully warm and efficient. And the food, served up speedily, is superb: tasty, plentiful and beautifully prepared. You can get a superb breakfast/ brunch for two here at around forty dollars. And if you sit outside you can watch the world go by as you enjoy your food. Perfection.

Top place for a great breakfast. Chorizo scramble had more than once rather than sampling others - sorry, but it was so good!! Great choice but be prepared to wait - it is very popular! Not sure about the method of tipping......asking for it before you get your breakfast so how do you know what sort of service you'll get? That said, it does seem to be pretty good.

Great breakfast, huge choice

Tripadvisor reviews led us to this place. We found twh queues to sit down walking out the door so we had to wait 15 mins before we got a table and placed a order.But once ordered we had great food, in a real relaxed urban restaurant . Had a good feel about the place and the other customers seemed to range from all walks of life.

Quite a treat awaits anyone visiting this little treasure, tucked away at an unassuming corner just down the street from SF's Union Square. Great breakfast, friendly service and even WiFi. Not only is the coffee barrista level, but if you like crepe, this place is a must.The line speaks for itself, but is well worth the wait.

We were staying nearby so went Honey Honey on our last morning in the city for a late brunch. There was a fairly long line but orders were taken quickly and we were able to find a table. We had an omelette, eggs Benedict and fruit cups and both dishes were delicious, arriving quickly and with generous portions. Worth a visit if you want a decent breakfast or lunch near to Union Square.

The place is lighted with neon lights and the interior is Mexican in style. It has a very relaxed, comfortable feeling. Of course, what is best is the crepe, be it as a dish or as dessert. The staff were also very friendly giving tips on what to expect in the dish offered.

At the cornet of Post Street and Taylor, this colorful downtown eatery is frequented by locals and tourists alike. Arrive early for breakfast, because the line is often out the door and around the corner after 8:30. With a menu displayed on the wall, choose your item, step up to the counter to order, pay and get your number, hopefully find a seat and wait for your meal to be delivered to your table. Omelets are massive, the fried potatoes delicious, the crepes looked amazing, the pancakes light and flavorful. The juices are freshly squeezed. We dined at breakfast, but would like to return to sample the wide ranging lunch choices.

Honey Honey could get pretty busy and line outside the door, but it's worth the wait. Amazing breakfast, just about everything you could want for breakfast. The price was not bad at all. If you're ever in the Union Square area of San Francisco you should give Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery a try.

Went here for breakfast after hearing good things about the place. The breakfast menu was extensive and you certainly had plenty of time to chose what you wanted to order, the queue to the counter to place your order before sitting to wait for your food was really long. We got there just after 8.00am on a weekday and the counter queue was 20mins. But the food was really good. If you don't mind the wait you will get a great breakfast at a really reasonable price compared to other SF breakfast eateries

Arrived outside restaurant at 7.10am for 7.30am opening as we read that there is usually a line. We were first there. After waiting til 7.30 with loads of other people arriving, some staff actually turned up, then came out to inform us that they were not opening until 8am without even so much of an apology! Most people left, but we had waited this long so at 7.50 the doors finally opened and we went in and got a table (first in, well we had been waiting since just after 7am). Couldn't understand why everyone was rushing up to the counter and not sitting down only to be told that another customer you order at the counter. Every single person who arrived after us was served before us. Even after giving out order we waited 35 mins for our breakfast to arrive. So it basically took just under two hours for me to have a Nutella crepe which was extremely mediocre anyway!! My husband said his savoury breakfast crepe was extremely good. Good filter coffee with free refill but you have to take your cups up to the counter and none of the staff told us this, again it was another customer. Guys, you need to improve your customer service somewhat.

We were there on a Monday morning. It was lined up.We waited for at least 45 minutes standing in line to get seated. (Almost all the breakfast place around the tourism zones have a line up). Once we were seated, the food came fast. Two crepes, an Italian soda and a coffee plus tips cost $32USD. You can also have mint or orange infused water for free while waiting.

One of the best things about San Francisco is its abundance in restaurants and cafes for breakfast. Honey Honey is one such Cafe that we planned on visiting after reading its reviews. We had to power through a 30 minute queue, but it was worth it. We all really enjoyed our dishes. It was a wholesome and satisfying breakfast. This place is vegetarian friendly ( I am assuming eggs is Veg). We being Vegetarians found it a refreshing change to the same old boring breakfasts available in most hotel buffets.

I made the mistake of going here on Labor Day, at about 9:30am - the queue was through the restaurant and down the street! But the reviews on Trip Advisor were so good that I really wanted to try it, and I knew the big queue had to be a good sign lol so i waited. After about 45 minutes I got seated and ordered the banana and nutella crepe with whipped cream. It was huge and absolutely beautiful, I was so full I didn't eat lunch lol. If I am ever in San Francisco again I will head straight here for breakfast :)

The girl at the front desk of our hotel recommended this place. It was an excellent recommendation. Honey Honey does crepes right. Whether you like sweet or savory they have you covered. There was a fairly long line which moved quickly when we entered the restaurant. The chalk-board style menu is up on the wall when you walk in. They have counter style ordering. After you place your order they give you a number and someone brings out your food. I decided on the special Dulce de leche crepe. This was hands down the best crepe I have eaten.

Everything was perfect nothing greasy or oily and there are many options to choose from. Will definitely go back of I am in San Fran.

The menu consists of good old American breakfast favorites - their Egg Florentine was delicious. The eggs were soft on the outside and runny on the inside. The spinach was fresh and the English muffins were lightly toasted. The OJ was freshly squeezed. The only downside is the slow cashier service but once you order, the food is cooked to order and served to the table fairly quickly. Centrally located - 2 blocks off Powell from Union Square. Will certainly be back.

The staff is very helpful and attentive. We had the Mediterranean Omelette, Salmon Benedict, Eggs Florentine, and Nutella Banana Crepe (yum!) - everything was fantastic.

When you arrive the line outside the door can be disconcerting; but it moves well and there is a good reason for the line. This is a casual all day restaurant with well prepared comfort food. As you get closer to the order counter you are assigned a table number where you sit until your order arrives. They are flexible at substitutions, altohugh if you change orders to crepes from tortillas for the Huevos Rancheros there is a $1 charge. The meals themselves are very good and the service friendly and efficient. Price wise the costs are prteey much average for similar meals

While on vacation from Texas, us a family of 5 had breakfast here 7/17. I think it opened at 7:30am and we got there at 7:45am, which was just before the Monday morning rush! We had also tried to go the morning before, but a Sunday morning at 9:30am, the line was out the door so we had given up. All 5 of us got something different for breakfast and loved it. A must go-to eatery, if you are in town but get there early or be prepared to wait in line.

They were also very accommodating for my son's tree but allergy and prepared for him a banana chocolate crepe. If you get the chocolate nutella crepes, I recommend the scoop of ice cream with it. Wide selection on the menu including pastas, salads, sandwiches, in addition to the breakfast items.

Honey Honey is a very popular breakfast restaurant, just a couple of blocks west of Union Square. Specialties are crepes, but also offer fruit, pancakes, croissant sandwiches, and breakfast burritos. The way it works is, you stand in line to place your order and then take a seat (if you can find one). They always seem to be busy, and it doesn't appear that you can get a second cup of coffee without getting back into line. But the food is very good.

If this were near I worked it would be a favorite among colleagues. Since this was a late lunch for me I had the benefit of no line. Turkey/Bacon/Avocado sandwich on baguette was very good and more than filling. I tend to think of bread as the most important ingredient in a sandwich and this one was good if not french. The home fries that come on the side had cilantro (yuk!). Really, I thought Prop 65 should have handled this! They were quickly remade without fuss. If I lived here, it would be on my lunch rotation.

We dragged my exhausted 10 year old out for an early evening crepe here, based on the trip advisor reviews, and really wished we hadn't bothered. Admittedly it was a Sunday at the end of the day but the whole place needed a really good sweep and wipe down. We had a couple of crepes and a burger - the burger was pretty tasteless and a bit of fried onion in my strawberry and chocolate crepe was not a great combo. Struggling to understand how it has got so many rave reviews but I would give it a miss and recommend 'The Grove' instead.

I went here for breakfast on a weekday, and the wait time was still about twenty minutes or so.We ordered the breakfast crepe, the Nutella strawberry crepe, the Milano omelette and the crab cake florentine.Everything besides the crab cake florentine was marvellous. So my advice would be to stick to the basics here - they do brilliant crepes and eggs. Their breakfast potatoes deserve a special mention too! The crab cake florentine was the only dampener - so probably steer clear from that.The place is quite small, so be prepared to wait - specially if you're planning to come on a weekend.

We stopped by based on the many excellent Trip Advisor reviews and they were right on the money. This place was so incredibly delicious! The line was out the door but moved at a decent pace. The menu was extensive with offerings of both sweet and savory crepes, sandwiches, drinks, etc. We had a lot of fun mixing and matching our choices and ended up with a wonderful selection of their offerings. We took sandwiches to go and they were equally delicious. I highly recommend a swing through Honey Honey during your visit to SF.

Great food...just be patient

Just look for the line at the corner of Post and Taylor for the Honey Honey Cafe. Don't be too discouraged though - they do a decent job of moving you along. As you're ordering, a member of their staff is finding you a table. If you are coming as a large group, I would break up into smaller groups as they have limited seating. We had the chocolate waffles, chicken burrito (a daily special) and banana crepes. Everything was great! Location is convenient to Union Square. Would definitely go again!

The Dulce crepes were on the day's specials. And they are pretty special. It's very crowded at breakfast, like, like many of the restaurants during summer vacation in San Francisco. All the food was great. The home fries are great.

Great breakfast place!

We knew it had to be pretty good when we arrived and saw the line out the door. It moved really quick and a staff member came by and assigned everyone a table before you ordered. My hubby and I had the Breakfast Crepe, and my son had the Nutella Banana Walnut crepe. Oh. My. Gosh. I took a bite of my son's and thought I'd died and gone to Nutella heaven. My only wish is that we were here longer so we could go back!! 

Ok

Nothing much to say, good omelette and crepes but not the best. The potatoes are over fried and very greasy. 

My favorite breakfast place

This is definitely a hidden gem and the best place for breakfast in union square area! I couldn't finish the crepes, they were amazing! The coffee was great too! The have lunch/dinner food too. Ate here 3 mornings in a row after finding it. Good prices as well.

Fine, but didn’t live up to the hype

Mozzarella Bagel
Rating: 1

I ordered the mozzarella bagel and it was the worst food I have ever been served in a restaurant. I have never left a review for a restaurant before but I made an account exclusively to leave this one. The bagel was cold and soggy because it was sitting in a pool of canned tomato juice, it looked and tasted like it has been made the previous day and left out overnight. I am not picky but the bagel was inedible.

Good American Breakfast Spot

If you're looking for a classic American breakfast then this place has it all. Extensive menu so something for everyone although not perhaps for the health conscious individual. We visited as an indulgent treat on a Sunday morning. We got there early (8:30am) or so we thought but the queue was out the door. However, we were glad we waited as it went down very quickly. We thought the system of ordering first then sitting down was great as it sped things up. Coffee was good too and they had a variety of milks including almond which was a plus. 

Better Skip this One

I should have looked on my app for reviews before wasting my time and $ here. A local luxury boutique hotel referred me to this place, and um, feel free to skip this one. Why did they refer me to a restaurant that reminded me of a Tijuana bar? I ordered a crab cake sandwich and my husband had a salmon sandwich. The crab was fried on dry white bread, and it came with hard potatoes that were as crispy as the croutons. The salmon sandwich was a sliver of lox. I didn't know how to handle this situation? Do I eat it, return it, or just leave? Out of politeness, I attempted to eat it. Terrible, through and through. The employees are all depressed. The atmosphere is grungy and sticky. There's something missing at this restaurant and I think it's called love. Honey honey has so much potential because it's in the middle of so many hotels, but it is overpriced and completely under delivers. 

Great crepes with lots of different fillings!

This place was about block from our hotel, and it was so good we ate all our breakfasts there. The salsa crepe was my favorite: great tasting and lots of healthy veggies. The coffee is good as well. I'll have to go n=back because I never got to the waffles and pancakes, which are a favorite of mine. We did manage to check out the nutella and banana crepe one evening for dessert.Excellent!

Overrated- auto tip charge

Overrated. Long wait and food quality was average. Tables were not cleaned (assumed it's a volume issue, but needs attention). There was a forced tip when paying w credit card. Seemed odd since you have not received your food and only just ordered. Either call it a service fee for delivery to table or work into food cost. Turn off to be chanted for a service that should be optional, done at the end of service. 

A cute little place - Very busy &amp; Noisy

We called in for a 10am breakfast and got served at 11am so be prepared to wait. The line up was actually out the door. They do sweet and savoury but my advice is stick to the sweet. Their sweet dishes are excellent - pancakes, crepes, waffles etc. Savoury dishes like eggs benedict are not so good. Nice Latte, nice orange juice. A good spot overall.

No long queue. Went approx 12.30 on a Monday and only a couple of people ahead of us. Fantastic freshly made food served hot. Will definitely visit again. Extensive menu for breakfast lunch and dinner. Looking around at other diners all the food looked great. From salads, pastas, burgers, omelettes, eggs all ways!, crepes and soups. So much choice. Highly recommend.

We were walking by looking for a place to grab some breakfast and found Honey Honey. There was a line but it moved fast and our food was ready at our table very quickly. Cute, clean restaurant with a good variety on the menu. We had the two, two, and two (two pancakes, two strips of bacon, and two eggs) and the sunrise burrito. Both were delicious! Also had the iced mocha which did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend this place. They were super busy but the customer service was excellent and they handled it well. 

Friendly service and great variety @ value

6 of us bored of hotel breakfast found this gem, fantastic choice on offer of crepes both savoury and sweet, breakfast, omelettes, burgers. Queuing out the door, but don't let that put you off, the super friendly team have a system that just works and will always find you a table. Pretty reasonable too, around $15 for a breakfast banquet to set up your day
