My wife and I ate there for our last meal in SF. Everyone was very friendly and there was lots of energy. The food was very good and hearty portions. The bread was excellent. For me though, it was very loud. Difficult to have a quite conversation. Host yelling at the waiters ( not in mean way ), it's just what they do. Waiters yelling at each other. Just like being in a large Italian household during a holiday.

Ate dinner here tonight. The place is small and hot but the food was sooo good. Fresh pasta and fantastic service. Not sure but I think it may be Dad and a couple of his sons that run/own it?? They are hardcore Italian and such nice people. They are loud!! Lots of Italian shouting from waiters to the bar and kitchen! A truly authentic Italian restaurant that should not be missed when in SF. 

Magnifico!

The most enthusiastic family owns and runs this place. The menu is small, but offers amazing Italian food with over the top authenticity. Pasta is made in house, seafood and meats are fresh, wine selection is great. Staff is prompt and friendly. There is something for everyone. Sit by the windows and watch the world go by.

I can't recommend this place enough, the food was sooo delicious. I recommend going hungry if you want to get the full meal experience. If you are just looking for a little something, any of the pasta dishes will more than delight your taste buds. The meat dishes were good, but honestly I would stick with the pasta if you are choosing one over the other. The wait staff was so incredibly friendly and made you feel like family which I also loved. If I ever make it back to San Fran, I will go back to this place!!!

Good food, a really nice space, and a great staff made for a good experience. Unfortunately, they claimed to be unable to provide separate checks, which was a real pain. That's a customer-unfriendly thing to do, and I haven't come across a place making that mistake in a VERY long time. My advise is to definitely go there with your significant other, but avoid it otherwise (unless you enjoy doing the math the split up the bill on your own).

Friendly crazy and cozy ambiance, food is nice.

Our taxi driver struggled to find this location very restaurant as it has only a small corner door. But behind that door is a San Francisco gem. We were met by a great guy who sat us down by the window and our waiter chatted to us about everything possible to make us feel at home, and explain the menu and his recommendations. We chose the bruschetta and raw beef to start and they were both lovely. For our main course steve had a pasta with sausage special and Kathy had Sea Bass and we followed with two different types of Tiramasu . The wine we chose was from the Godfathers vineyard so tasty. Luckily we found horse head on our pillow later. LolAs some one else from U.K. said a bit pricey but then it's San Francisco Loved our evening so busy and the singing happy waiters give the place a great atmosphere

We visited here after looking at the trip advisor reviews. We booked a table, but there was a queue when we arrived and the booking didn't seem to matter as we still had to wait and were seated (next to the door) at the same time as others that had been queuing without a reservation. The place is really buzzy with a good atmosphere, and the staff are all upbeat - if you want a quiet dinner then this isn't the place for that! Food was just okay, I had pasta and my partner a pizza. I also ordered a dessert of a chocolate truffle, which when it came was basically a scoop of ice-cream and not what I expected, this should possibly be on the description that it is frozen. Luckily my partner loves ice cream so ate the dessert! Not a bad experience at all, and the staff and service as I said were great, but just not sure it is more than 3 stars in my opinion. 

Very nice place- don't miss it!

This is in the 'Italian' section of SF known as North Beach. The food was authentic and very good. We had a large party of 9 and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. We ordered a pizza for an appetizer and it was a big hit. The bruschetta was also delicious. Ravioli di Castagne - Filled with chestnuts in a buttery sage sauce was amazing and was the Gnocchi - Potato dumplings with your choice of Sorrentina or Gorgonzola sauce! Everything here is made in house - yes....that means house made pasta & the Gnocchi! Others in our group tried the chicken and fish dinners and loved them as well. The server was friendly, helpful, efficient and eager to please...and did I mention that he was also good looking??!!!! We will definitely be back on our next trip to SF!!!!

Great evening in a very buzzy place and delicious authentic Italian food. Only Italians could make you feel so welcome as this place does. As someone else has remarked, it feels as though all the waiters (and manager) were serving us alone so attentive was the service. .. Quite a feat in a very busy and obviously popular place; it's clear there is a local following as well as serving tourists like us. For us it seemed expensive but then San Francisco is!

Found this place on the web. Situated in North Beach on Columbus just after Chinatown. When you walk in Andrea greets you in Italian and Gaetano serves you in Italian because they are Italian.

I had dinner here dining solo on a business trip a couple of weeks ago. Food and service were both great. My waiter suggested the Paccheri Golosi, "large tube pasta with Prosciutto, Porcini Mushrooms & Truffle Oil in a cream sauce," which I understand is their specialty. It was very tasty!The waiters are friendly, attentive and high energy. Be aware that although you will have a primary waiter, you will probably be waited on by all or most of the other waiters throughout your dinner. They seem VERY Italian!Dress: You would fit in here wearing anything from casual (jeans, tee shirts) to business casual.

When you are touring San Francisco one of the things you want to know is where to eat. When being at Little Italy, it is so crowded of restaurants that is somehow ends up being confusing. We finally went to E tutto Qua without knowing anything from the place. It was a right choice. They are italians (which is something good to expect because a lot of then are not). The food was so tasty (i recommend the pizzas, because they are so well naturals and lighty cooked). The service was fast and gentle, they brought us water and bread at no extra cost, and they didn't ask for tip!!! The prices ar eon average (20$ per pax). I would totally recommend it, specially if you are a tourist!

Another day in SF, after walking for a while we stopped by an Italian restaurant. The reviews were pretty impressive so we jumped in.A quite busy place on a Saturday evening, but staff is very good and fast to get you a table.As appetizers, we had eggplant pamigianna and the bruschettas.Both were well prepared and good.We opted for a bottle of Chianti, great red Italian wine.My wife had the Paccheri Golosi, big tube pasta kind with cured ham (unsure), mushroom with truffle oil taste in a creamy sauce. It was delicious to her.I ordered the Tonarelli do Mare, a dish made with fresh spaghetti shrimps calamari in a sauce with white wine. Never had any before and I can say this delicious. The calamari and shrimps were perfectly cooked . I really loved it.For dessert we shared a very good homemade tiramisu, great wit an espresso.The place is not over priced for San Francisco so we really enjoyed our dinner.

The service at E Tutto Qua was the best I have ever experience. The wait staff are very Italian, very friendly, lots of fun, and full of energy. It's like being in an Italian home. Their signature dish Paccheri Golosi is an incredible mouth watering dish. It's definitely a must and I highly recommend it.. We could not get enough of it. We should have only ordered the Paccheri Golosi.Nothing else could compare. We ordered their thin pizza, which was recommend. Yes, it was paper thin and the sauce was fresh however, it lacked flavor. The gnocchi were over cooked.The establishment itself is bit worn and is in need of a little TLC. Their bathroom could be cleaner. Nonetheless, the food was still good. We had a fantastic time and a magnificent experience. I would recommend the restaurant.

E Tutti Qua may, at first glance, seem to be a tourist restaurant. It's not. This is a serious, first rate Italian restaurant that I very highly recommend. The food is authentic and very good. There are some standards, but there are also some dishes that are unusual that are really terrific. For example, our scallop appetizer was first rate.The service is very friendly, professional, and fun. The wine list has a lot of choices at a variety of price points. And it is a serious list.My only quibble: the restaurant is noisy -- it's not a place for an intimate romantic dinner. But the food is great. Definitely worth a visit.

From the moment you step inside and are greeted by your host, you are swept inside a frenzied, crazy vortex of Italian culinary madness. From the waiters communicating in robust Italian to the host, to the host belting out an old Italian classic, to happy birthday being sung at the top of Italian lungs and glasses breaking, you know when you're dining at E Tutto Qua. Our meal was excellent. My family all had pasta dishes and they were fantastic. Desert was amazing as well.

The service is fast and the food is superb. On our last visit, we started with the Fritto Misto which is lightly fried shrimp, calamari and zucchini. It was excellent. For our entrees, my wife chose the classic pizza which is topped with prosciutto and fresh arugala. The crust is wafer thin and it is one of the best pizzas we've eaten. I chose one of the dinner specials, the linguine with crab and scallops in a tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes. Again, way good. We shared our entrees; So, we both got it all. They have a reasonably priced wine list with a good selection to choose from. There are many good Italian restaurants to choose from in North Beach, this is one of the best.

It was VERY busy at 9:30 and we were greeted by SINGING servers and friendly smiles. They found a table for us right away. Our waiter told us stories of the family behind the restaurant and spoke to him for quite some time about their home - Sardinia. Learned quite a bit and appreciated their kindness. Since we were there so late, we saw them ALL set up their own dinner at a huge table for after they closed. You can tell they all are family and it was a warm feeling restaurant. I didn't LOVE my dish, but everyone else I was with licked their plate clean and felt they HAD to order dessert bc the meal was so good!

First, I called to make a reservation for 10 people and when we arrived they had us waiting at the bar. FineWe ate and food was good. However, when we asked for separate checks we were told they couldn't do it. I asked to pay separate at the register and they couldn't do it either. I asked the manager and all he could tell me was "I already did my job." He left and the waiter brought me the check trying to apologize but nothing else. After they ran my card, I see an automatic til for 18%. Follow? They didn't want to break the check because of the auto tip. Money hungry? Had they given us separate checks we would have had given them a bigger tip. It's math.Never going back.Nevertheless,

Beet salad, and octopus appetizer were good, not great. The big disappointment was the flavorless linguine with clam sauce, which was the main reason we went there - very bland, no hint of garlic or lemon, had to sprinkle salt to give it some flavor. All very unremarkable. The staff was very friendly.

If you are Italian and miss a grandma pasta dish this is your place. If you're not Italian after that meal you are going to miss it too. 

Amazing!

Earlier this week, I decided on this restaurant for having a mother/daughter dinner. It ended up being close to our hotel, a nice atmosphere, had good food, and a great wait staff. We enjoyed a good meal, with many options to chose from. It was a corner lot restaurant, adjacent to two busy streets. That made for a fun people watching San Francisco experience. My mother especially enjoyed watching one of the waiters dancing by to the music that was playing. They clearly are paying attention to having attentive service. Everyone is friendly and there to make your evening a good one. They are bucking the long standing reputation of San Francisco waiters having snobby attitudes. We got hugs on the way out..... and somehow it didn't feel odd. Fun! We had a seafood pasta with crab and scallops in a red sauce. Yummy! It was a special, but they had many items to chose from, so all was good. Their pear salad was tasty and even their simple field greens house salad looked tasty and plentiful. I didn't try one, but their itallan wine list was large.This was not inexpensive, but fun for a special evening, and not overly priced for the city.

The food is good but waiter forgot to bring out main course

We made reservations for a Sunday evening following a performance of Beach Blanket Babylon. We arrived early and were were greeted as if we were old friends. We had a few minutes to wait for the table, but we were whisked inside to be seated at the bar and made to feel right at home as we waited. It is lively and energetic, but also a lot of fun to watch in action. We visited with 2 teenagers, all had an AMAZING MEAL and it was by far our favorite dining experience while in SF!

True to its name! Worth every dime! Exquisite food! Exiting and welcoming environment! Lovely staff!

Firstly, don't let the ambiance or set up of this restaurant put you off. The restaurant itself is a little noisy, and comes across as a little budget. However the food here is incredible. We ate the steak which was perfectly cooked, and delicious. The service and waiting staff are also very good. If you're looking for an evening meal I world highly recommend this restaurant. 

But for the noise, it is a six.

This was a great, fun and satisfying stop. The service and food was excellent. It is loud however. People having fun loud makes this an okay place to go. Everyone was happy and genuine. We went without a reservation on Friday night and were seated right away. The place was crowded, but food and drinks were swift and service attentive. Next time I am in San Francisco, I would not hesitate to return. We walked here after having drinks at the Top of the Mark and were very glad we did.

Excellent dinner

Absolutely enjoyed our 3 course meal. Scallops for app were incredible. Dinner was lamb chops and paccheri golosi were mouth watering and perfectly cooked. Tiramisu was the perfect ending. So good!

Not the place to come to for a romantic dinner but great atmosphere and food good too. We had the seafood soup. Lovely. And a nice red wine. Great choice and well priced.This was our 2nd choice as 1st was too full. We walked a few blocks n came across this place. The area was not particularly nice but would recommend restaurant.

It opens at 5 PM. Plenty tables at that time, then it got crowded. Staff was very pleasant and we got excellent service. Food !!!!! I was kind of disappointed. I was expecting better taste, quality and portions. My chicken was very salty and very small portion for the price. I want some small plate of pasta and what I got, was small but very pricey. Other dishes that my party ordered, were also small and nothing amazing. Also to be in California, wine list was limited and expensive. I will try another Italian restaurant next time.

Great atmosphere, enjoyable food

My sister and I popped in to E Tutto Qua on a recent visit to SF. We were looking for some fresh pasta and happened to be in the perfect neighbourhood. Immediately upon walking in, we were overwhelmed with the energy of the place. The food is simple and good. The service was engaging - the waiters all seemed to have been imported from Rome (not sure that they were all legit Romans, but they played the part well.)We ordered the burratta appetizer - can't really go wrong with cheese, arugula, tomato and olive oil. The pastas were good, though a little on the saucy side. We didn't do dessert as the pasta portions were big enough.It's really the atmosphere that left such an impression. If you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this isn't the place. If you want to have a bit of festivity, by all means, go to this restaurant.

Much of San Francisco's little Italy is alas overpriced, Americanized, dingy, and inauthentic (of which only the dingy part applies in comparison to the Italian restaurants that they all claim to emulate). Worst of all is the manner in which many of the restaurants in little Italy rush their customers and rely heavily upon fruit-bomb California wines which pair strangely with the foodNot so E Tutti Qua. What a treat!Fabulous Roman and Campagna styled food, replete with octopus, fresh mozzarella, and lots of Italian wine to pair. (If you prefer the fruit happy Napa wines they're on the menu as well).I noticed a good number of customers speaking Italian, always a good sign. Plus the singing brothers/cousins seemed to be having a great time. Fresh food. Tastefully done roomy interior, and good views. Look forward to returning!

It's authentic Italian food AND also great!The taste was just perfect, like the size of portions and the mix of ingredients.Well located and warm atmosphere, the super nice and friendly staff makes you feel like at home. We went there twice during a 3 days stay in SF and we would have definitely come back again if didn't have to leave!Recommendation: keep space to try the desserts!

Magnificent!

This was hands down the best eating experience I had on my trip in San Fran. The food was great and the service was even better. Every restaurant in San Fran should take notes on how these boys handle their restaurant 

Our very favorite Italian restaurant anywhere

The food is authentic and wonderful. The historic building's location is unique and its exterior is iconic. Its interior is special. The ambience is right on target. They bring in Italian waiters, who are cheerful and playful, as well as very passionate and knowledgeable about food. I have been their with family and with international business clients and the experience was special in all cases.
