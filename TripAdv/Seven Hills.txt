First time and not last for sure!What a delicious dinner we had. We started with Burrata I had a salad with pomegranate and persimmons that was delicious.We shared a pasta filled with ricotta and truffle special and we ordered a second plate because it was so good that it was not enough. The rest of my party had the fish and they loved it. I had the meatballs. Everything was super fresh and could had not been better. We are coming back! Worth every penny. Excellent with food allergies. Michael was our server and he was terrific. Thank you!

The most amazing meal &amp; service!

Seven Hills is an Italian restaurant on Nob Hill - on the cable car route. It is relatively small & busy - so you need reservations even on weekdays. The menu is limited - with specials. They do not have a traditional Italian menu - eclectic & unique gourmet preparations- everything we tried was excellent. Very good service.

Based on the reviews, my husband and I booked this restaurant for the last night of our stay in SF and were anticipating a great dinner. Lesson learnt - read the negative reviews as well as positive and don't jump to good conclusions. Service was bad - in a passive aggressive way, the server Louis commented that his day was 'living a dream', was unhappy that we asked for a decanter, did not poor us the wine, forgot to poor us the water - but was happily doing all those things for the table 50cm next to us (I am guessing they were his friends?). Then we did not see him for the entire meal, and nearly the entire service was provided by the busboys and a very nice waitress (I am very sorry that we could not get her name).From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the manager ignored us coming in for at least 3 minutes, even though he clearly saw that we were there; he did not even acknowledge our presence. That would not have been so bad (there are bad managers all over the place) had I not found out after I came back to the hotel that the "manager" is in fact the owner of this place! The guy does not even step away in a small corridor to let his customers go through to the washroom - Alexis, you should learn from your busboys how to treat your customers with respect.It's ok that the place is small and you can eat off the neighbor's plate, that's expected. The prices are high, but that's expected too. But the level of attitude that the manager establishes in his staff is atrocious and ruins the entire experience. The food is good, but not good enough to compensate for it. I realize that this review is a drop in a bucket of 700+ great reviews, but want to do my part in a hope that it will help others.

The concierge at the Fairmont suggested this place and what a surprise. Located up on the "hill" neighborhood it is truly a local restaurant with all the aspects of a national winner,Small and intimate it takes you to a European bistro. Ok enough the food! everyone had a different dish all prepared superbly, the pasta is a no brainer, some of the best I have had, certainly outside of Italy. I ordered the carpaccio which was a bit dry, it appeared to have be prepared earlier and kept in the cooler, dried a bit. If there is anything that was annoying was the smaller serving plates which caused food to commingle. Just me.Wine list is ok, I would guest proportionate to the size of the place.

Wowwwww you HAVE to go!

Everything from top to bottom was delicious. Michael's recommendation for the wine was numero Uno. We shared parpadelle and pasta with truffles and, after tasting the ones in Italy last year, I can assure you that Alexis and his team toped that experience. And the dessert, just delicious! From Quebec, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you for this gorgeous meal. It makes the end of our trip memorable. Allain & Sylvie

This is a nice, small, local place. They did a really nice job with the homemade pasta with truffles. They weren't cheap with the truffles either. Service is excellent. They have a nice wine list that is reasonably priced. We are Italians from New York where there are a lot of great Italian restaurants. My wife is also an excellent cook. We have to really be overwhelmed to get to 5 stars. This restaurant is close but not there.

My husband had the black cod special, probably one of the best dishes we have ever had. I had their delicious squash blossom ravioli, light, tender and tasty.The beef carpaccio appetizer and the meatball were spectacular. By the way, it was our 45th wedding anniversary celebration!!

Went to Seven Hills on the 2nd night of our honeymoon in San Francisco on the basis of good reviews on trip advisor. Before we even arrived I was extremely impressed with Alex the owner's correspondence with me to make the booking. I can only describe our night in Seven Hills as perfect from beginning to end, we were warmly welcomed by the staff whom know when to intervene and assist and when to leave you alone to enjoy your night (something which a lot of American restaurants don't do as they feel the need to constantly bother you asking are you ok). As for the food, it was fantastic and great portion sizes, enough to satisfy you but not too much that you eat too much that you are then too full so thankfully we could enjoy all 3 courses. As for the bottom line, it definitely offers great value for money and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone in San Francisco, definitely the culinary highlight if not the absolute highlight of our stay in San Francisco.

Dish after dish of delicious food was brought before me, and each plate became a battlefield of my sheer will versus a plate of decadent delight. The war was hard fought, but in the end, I waddled home happy. Please go here and eat everything. The tomatoes, the truffles, the pasta, everything. Try the desserts, too. The staff were nice, the place was pleasant - and the food was worth it. Thank you for making tonight magical, Seven Hills! <3

This was some of the best Italian food we have had (and we have been to Italy many times). Each dish was prepared in a unique and immensely flavorful way. On top of that, the owner is wonderful and accommodating. Knowing that it was our 10th anniversary he made arrangements to squeeze us in and with complimentary glasses of prosecco! But be forewarned. This is a small, neighborhood restaurant that seats maybe 20-25 people, so reserve early. This is a special place not to be missed,

Visiting San Francisco and decided to try this spot since it came well recommended. The food is good, the wine is great, and our server was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was nice and the background music was pleasant. The only complaint is that there was a charge of $3 for bread we were offered while we waited for the appetizers. I thought this was a bit silly and if they are going to charge for bread/butter they should mention it in advance. Otherwise, a nice spot for an intimate dinner.

Service and food were both suburb! The restaurant is small and cozy -- and with its reputation, you had better have a reservation.I had the special, which was lobster ravioli with black truffles. It was divine. The salad with prosciutto was also excellent. Seven Hills has a nice wine list, including several served by the glass, and the wait staff can assist you in making your selection.Highly recommended!

We took the cable car back to the hotel about 8 pm when it was no longer crowded.

This is THE restaurant you should consider for a special date. I think that at least 6 of the couples were celebrating anniversaries or birthdays.

As appropriate to a California Italian restaurant, they have a good wine list with both California and Italian wines.

We own a restaurant in NOLA, and we handmake all our pasta. You'd think we'd have had our fill and wouldn't seek out other pasta making restaurants. Not so. Seven Hills is a cozy restaurant cranking out some of the best pasta dishes I've ever tried. We began with the polpetta and the macheroni with ricotta. I could have eaten that pasta all night long. The sauce was spectacular. Next we had a special pappardelle with summer black truffle butter and shaved truffle. Earthy and heavenly at the same time. Finally, we finished with the beef/pork/duck ragu. It was meaty with huge chunks of meat. Do not skip the bread simply because there is a charge for it. It's only a dollar and worth 10 times that. You're gonna need, it, too...to wipe up your plates with. Service was friendly and efficient. Make a reservation, this place is quite popular.

We went to Seven HIlls the first night of our 30th anniversary trip to S.F. The restaurant is small (nicely so) and very intimate. The owner made sure everything was exactly as we wanted. The truffle pasta was wonderful. Service was fast and we felt lucky to get into the number one rated restaurant in S.F. (in my opinion).I recommend the Ramini Buffalo Mozzarella appetizer, the Tortellini for the main course. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Bodino (to die for). Even the coffee was amazing.The service was swift and we were never waiting a long time for any part of our meal. Put this restaurant on your S.F. list.

They had a Halibut special local caught served sushi style that was delicious. All the pasta is home made in house. The special was made with truffles from Britain and was melt in your mouth good. All three of us loved it. Bread was home made. Everything was wonderful. Service was good, not excellent, space was intimate.

I came here three years ago with my childhood friend and knew I had to go again with my husband when we were celebrating our anniversary! He agreed that this was a great meal to start our romantic trip to San Fransico. We called for a reservation as the seating is limited and fills up quickly. Alexis Solomou, the owner, attentive bartender, and host has a winning menu of great food, and when we mentioned it was our anniversary he went out of his way to make sure we had a lovely meal. We started off with the burrata, Creamy heirloom tomato bisque, Tomatero Farm pan roasted padron peppers and the melon salad. All were delicious and the melon was an especially refreshing way to start off the meal. Our waitress brought over a tasting of homemade ricotta cheese and corn on crustini as an anniversary surprise. For the main course, we had Tagliatelle and Tortelloni, which were both great. Our only complaint would be we never heard the fish of the day which we saw someone have and wish we had heard that as one of our options. We declined dessert since we were full but Alex hand delivered a Choclate Budino with a candle to celebrate our anniversary. Definitely save room for this - a decadent hazelnut pudding with fresh whipped cream that was a wonderful ending to a great dinner. The service was outstanding and if you want to impress a new date or your sould mate this is the place to go.

We called on the same day hoping to have a table. Lucky that the owner, Alexis, same there are 2 pots at the bar and he can hold them for us if we go right away. When I travel, I always ask "I am a tourist. There is a chance I may only come here once. What do you think I must try so that I will dream to come again?" They told us pasta is their signature. So we ordered 2 to start. He was amazing that he told us to hold on to the side dish, and we can order if we feel we want more food. Glad he suggested it, the pasta dishes were amazing and we ended up ordered a third one. The pasta has a great texture and they put a lot of effort for all the sauces. Freshly crashed tomatoes sauce, bolognese that takes them 4 hours to cook, and buffalo ricotta filling. Everyone of them are way above expectations. The taste of freshness is remarkable. Service swept me off my feet. I will definitely go again if I go SF. I will even make my reservation right after I book the hotel.

Dinner for two at this unpretentious restaurant on Hyde street was a very good experience. Yes, bread was an extra charge, but worth it.The duck pate crostini was superb. The ferro salad very refreshing. The sashimi good, needed a little punch. My pappardelle pasta as well as my wife's spaghetti with mushrooms were both very tasty.Menu is short, but with addition of specials, good. Service was very even and unhurried. Wine list not extensive, but covered all all budgets and palettes. Parking is an issue, but with the advent of Uber, not a problem.Will certainly pay return visit.

Went here for my son's 27th birthday. He had the Tomato Braised Polpette and Tortelloni I had the County Line Mixed Baby Lettuce and the Truffle Ravioli. The tastes were amazing - all around! My son loved the meatballs filled with cheese. I thought they were delicious and a bit spicy. He also loved the Tortelloni, and said it was one of the best pasta he ever had (he tried my truffle and that rate the best ever). My salad reminded me of my grandmother's - Brought back wonderful memories. I also loved that the salad was on the larger side and that the pasta course was the perfect size. This is now my favorite Italian restaurant. That is saying a lot in San Francisco.

For our last night in San Francisco I booked this intimate little restaurant in the Russian Hill district. I made my reservations based on Trip Advisor reviews. This beautiful little restaurant was only a mile from our hotel on Fisherman's Wharf. It was cozy, intimate, and the perfect romantic spot for two. The food was the best Italian I have ever eaten. We had the prosciutto plate, meatballs, salad, spaghetti, tuna, and a chocolate dessert. The host and the waiter were amazing. The host remembered me from when we spoke on the phone and was very welcoming when we entered. The server was absolutely awesome - he knew everything about every dish, including the elaborate specials. He was very helpful, and everything we ordered was delicious. At the end of our meal I told them that it was "perfect." I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you're in San Francisco.

It's small and friendly, elegant but not in any way stuffy and the food is superb. In a city filled with great Italian restaurants this one (not in any of the typical neighborhoods where you would look for Italian) stands out. They have a specialty Bellini made with Elderberry instead of peach that was very tasty and some very interesting dishes. A salad with fresh figs and prosciutto was delicious and a black ink pasta with shrimp was mouth watering with an avalanche of flavors in every bite. The chocolate budino was a rich dark mousse and an excellent way to finish the meal.

We had traveled to San Francisco as the beginning of a week long California birthday celebration for a dear friend. Seven Hills was at the top of our must try in SF and we were so excited to get there. We ended up sharing plates for each course as was suggested. I have never had a more delicious meatball...EVER! Course after course were all unusual and just lovely. Wine just added another layer of happiness to our meal. One star off for service...which wasn't because of timing of food, but more for the aloof manner of our server. Maybe she was having a bad night?? Overall, I would definitely go back and give it another try.

I reviewed an excellent meal at 7 Hills and managed to give an incorrect rating - the opposite of what was intended. It is excellent and deserves that rating. It is truly a fine restaurant and we had an excellent meal.To repeat, what we had was simply a good meal. We had eaten there early on then there were some changes in management. We were assured it was back to form and it was.That's the truth. Eat there and be happy.

Our first time here and not sure what took us so long! We read all the hype of the "other" Italian restaurant Cotogna that opened about the same time and went there first. I can tell you Seven Hills beats Cotogna hands down on food, service and ambiance. The house made pastas are one of the best we have tasted even comparable to our meals in Rome. We had the white truffle addition and it reasonably priced at $15 supplement.The suckling pig pork chop was out of this world. Wine selection was well selected for the menu.The tables were a bit cozy for me but with the ambiance and decor, it fits overall to the setting.Right on Hyde cable car line, so San Francisco! A "must" if your are visiting and want to eat like a local

A visit to 'Seven Hills' has never disappointed! When booking a flight to SF (from Australia) we also make a booking to eat at Seven Hills. Our favourite restaurant in this great city because, no matter how long between visits (sometimes 2 years), the food and service just keeps getting better and better with each visit. We had a very special night there recently with local friends, who had not been there before and they loved it! The food was exceptional as was the service. Alexis and his team are committed to making your night with them a memorable one. Alexis, you are a very generous host and we love, love visiting your restaurant. Congratulations to you and your staff. See you again soon. 

Fabulous local gem

What a delicious find! We had this restaurant recommended by a friend and it was the perfect introduction in to San Fran local dining. The service was terrific, wonderful wine list and the pasta made fresh in-house was sublime. We loved our evening at Seven Hills and will definitely recommend this restaurant to all our friends.

This comfortable Italian restaurant encourages diners to share dishes of food. If you don't know what a Raviolo is, wait till you try it. It is my favorite thing to start with. This dish is a miracle of timing and taste. I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu.

this was a small quaint restaurant with excellent Italian food! They also have appetizers and entree specials not on the menu. I had the pork chop which was perfectly done.I read about how challenging the parking was in this area and parked at the Jug Shop for $10. It's only two blocks away and worth avoiding the aggravation of finding parking

Best food in San Francisco!

Everything you order here is magnificent!!! Chef Anthony Florian is outstanding. We come from New York City and this is our favorite place to dine. Start with the meatballs. Insanely delicious. Last night I also had the gorgeous mozzarella salad with greens and sweet strawberries then the snap pea salad with creme fraiche. Then came the wild king salmon. My husband ordered the special pasta, black squid ink pasta with shrimp and tomatoes. Now dessert! They have mastered the smooth as silk and not too sweet Panna Cotta . A delicious Italian custard. Seriously the best I've ever had. We started off splitting that but ended up ordering another. Your stomach will say enough but your tastebuds will keep you eating. Lastly the owner Alexis, a very handsome gentleman from London makes you feel like you are at his home. Warm and inviting. We sat next to 2 couples who had never been here and they were so impressed. One couple had had dessert and paid their check and decided after my husbands rave reviews on the meatballs, ordered the meatballs. And boy were they glad they didn't miss this one. Ask for extra grilled toast to lop up every drop of the red sauce. It's beyond delicious. 

Lots of High Points, with a small exception

Very quickly. My wife and I ate here after reading many reviews that were very positive. Overall we LOVED it! Our favorite things were....the best meatballs I've ever had (stuffed with fontina cheese!)....fantastic breads....great swordfish and glazed pork chops....and really great service by the waitstaff.On the down side....let's talk about the gluten-free pasta. My wife is gluten-free, so we both know very well the consistency and texture of gluten-free. At Seven Hills, the chefs must've had a bad day when they made this one....it had a strange texture, and no real feel of "bite" at all. While the sauce was on point, this was a downside.With that, and a pretty steep price tag, you might think I'm dropping my score more. However, NOT true! There's so much goodness and yumminess at this place, and the workers and chefs do a stellar job! Highly recommended!

We had the wagyu beef and felt like it was the best bargain. We have eaten at steakhouses in New York and Vegas and a number of high end restaurants that serve this cut. This was the best we have eaten. Everything in the meal was incredible from the asparagus and kale to the salads and desserts. Also appreciate that the servers were able to pair wine for us and did a wonderful job. Look forward to a future visit

Family just recently moved to Nob Hill and this has become their "go to" place! They are now known to the wait staff, who could practically order for them. We shared lots of small plates: the duck liver pate, the snap pea salad, the mixed baby lettuce salad, the tortelli and the kale tagliatelle, one over-the-top ravioli uovo! We brought our own wine and skipped dessert (too full). Everything was super fresh, and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the snap pea salad and the ravioli in brown butter sauce. It's not on the menu, you have to ask for it, but our server told us right away there were portions available on the night we visited. An amazing, intimate restaurant, quiet enough to enjoy dinner table conversation without being drown out by music or other guests. We will be back!

As many on here point out, must haves are the grilled octopus (very tender) and squid ink pasta. We did not have a reservation and planned to sit at the bar (not a good plan - the bar is very small). But we asked the owner if any tables became available and he gave us one right then.Our server was just as friendly, and helpful. When we come back to SF, Seven Hills will be a first stop.

This is a wonderful restaurant that you won't be disappointed in . The food, farm to table is like eating in your grandma's house Sunday night in Brooklyn. The food is fresh and more importantly home made. Great location , easy to get to and priced fairly for San Francisco or any major city. The seating is tight but the gastronomic feast is worth the wait, you will love it,

A small and intimate foodie experience awaits diners at Seven Hills. Nick greeted us and sat us in a cozy booth at the back of the restaurant where our group of five could have a lively conversation. David was our very knowledgeable server who informed us of his upcoming sommelier exam. We know he passed with flying colors! The food is exquisite, colorful, healthy, and most of all satisfying. To choose a favorite dish is impossible. The Spanish octopus was divine, the truffle filled pasta so glorious we could have devoured more if our stomachs were larger, and the squid ink pasta amazing. Although scrumptious and beautiful, the beet salad was on the small side. My daughter adored the asparagus soup, such a brilliant color of chartreuse that is was almost too pretty to eat. Our table shared many of the dishes and by the time the main courses (halibut, pork chop) were served, we were too satiated to imbibe. Thankfully taking home these delicious bites made for a wonderful lunch the following day. Make reservations and enjoy an outstanding evening of attentive service and food that will make you sing. This is as great as it gets-an authentic culinary experience.

In recent years, San Francisco's nice Italian restaurants have sometimes disappointed - not any more! Seven Hills was just wonderful. Every dish we ordered was wonderful, and the atmosphere was very comfortable. It isn't an easy reservation, there's no easy parking, and the cable cars to and from are so crowded they can't be relied upon - but, hey, it sure was worth it!

My wife and I had a wonderful meal at Seven Hills. We went based on the recommendation of friends and also the excellent Trip Advisor rating. This is a gourmet Italian restaurant with excellent specialties. We tried the truffle tortellini (my first truffle tasting) and it was amazing! David, our server, was excellent and provided great information about both the menu items and wine suggestions. We enjoy Italian wines and his detailed knowledge of the three Nebbiolo offerings was very helpful. A great dining experience in an comfortable, neighborhood setting.

Probably the best Italian I've had in SFO: the restaurant is small and kind of dark and relaxed. The pasta was extraordinary and appetizers (crudo) were delicious. Wine list is extensive. Great place!

Park at the Jug Shop (great wine store) at 1590 Pacific and pay at their cashier. Seven Hills offers upscale Italian cooking with gracious service and an excellent wine list. We plan to return.

Our first dinner at Seven Hills and I hope to have many more. My husband and I saw the "Check Please" TV segment and were intrigues by the menu choices.We particularly wanted to try the Ravioli Uovo, one large ravioli filled with ricotta cheese and a poached egg, some fried sage too. Finished in a pool of brown butter. Decadent, rich, delicious. Save some bread to dip into the sauce!A special was the pasta pouches of ricotta served with a buttery black truffle sauce. Fresh dark truffles were grated over the top of this dish. It had a darker, more "forest floor" flavor than other truffle dishes we've had. Delicious, good serving size, and pricey at $45.As many reviews mention, the duck pate is very rich and flavorful! It is spread on top of 2 pieces of crusty, delicious crostini. Served with a piquant assembly of greens, pickled baby carrots, and pickled radish.The polpetti (2 meatballs with a little Fontina cheese baked inside) is served in good tomato sauce.Finished with my favorite Italian dessert, panna cotta. The flavor was vanilla bourbon with a surprise zest of kumquat at the bottom. Panna cotta (cooked cream) is rich and creamy, and this one filled that craving for me.Wine list was interesting and reasonable. Recommend the Falcone Syrah as a delicious wine to go with most of the dishes.Service was very good - there when we needed help - but not overly zealous. A charming dining room that made us want to linger.

I could be in a small intimate neighborhood restaurant in NYC or Paris when I enter Seven Hills. It's charming. It's the kind of restuarant you hope to get an insiders tip to when you are traveling. The quality of the food could rival a good restaurant in either of those cities. I love it!

This feels like a New York neighborhood gem - just on the other coast. One of those well kept secrets the locals know about and once you go you feel like you're "in the club." Beautiful food, they make all of their pasta and it shows. The grilled calamari was INCREDIBLE. I continue to recommend this place to friends: for dates, intimate dinners, anytime you you want to be able to actually communicate. Not a hushed atmosphere, but quiet enough to actually have dinner and hear your friends/guests/family across the table. Love the wine list, too!

Absolutely delicious pasta, wonderful waiter, terrific restaurant.
