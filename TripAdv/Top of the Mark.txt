We were recommended to visit by friends and arrived at 5pm on our final night of our honeymoon. Were were staying at a hotel on 5th Street and it's a 20 minute walk though beware it's all uphill so I would recommend flat shoes! When we arrived we requested a table with sunset view and were immediately impressed with the skyline of the city. Sunset was c7pm so we had a good 2 hours to take in the views and enjoy the cocktail menu. The drinks are pricey but it was an experience not to be missed! We enjoyed a flat bread from the tapas menu which was delicious but again pricey. Our waiter was very friendly and always asking if we wanted more details drinks. I ordered a Frisco cocktail which was too strong for my liking and our waiter kindly got it changed for me. A great experience and memories we will treasure forever.

My wife and I had never been here despite living in SF for over 10 years. We walked from Powell Station which is okay for us, but some would most likely prefer the 10 minute cab ride, especially if you don't want to walk up hills. We decided to go grab some cocktails and see the view. The menu had some great items but we ended up only ordering the nut mix appetizer to have with our cocktails. The nuts were very good, a nice mix that was a good size to go with our drinks. The view from our table was great! We could see the Golden Gate Bridge, the Transamerica Pyramid, Salesforce Tower, The Palace of Fine Arts, and all the way to the east bay. I can't remember our waiter's name, but he was great: low key & attentive. The host, George was great too in helping us find a good table. Luckily it wasn't too busy when we went so we had a few tables to choose from. The piano player played some nice selections to set the mood. We plan to bring family here during their next visit.

We came here twice for drinks on our most recent trip to San Francisco. The cocktail list is delicious and extensive, and the Happy Hour menu is great, and the view at Happy Hour is even better! I highly recommend the Mission & 16th cocktail (if you like tequila). The only unfortunate thing that happened here was that I was sitting in one of the chairs in my wedding dress (at the very end of our evening), and some of the varnish from the chairs transferred onto my dress. They were closing so I didn't get any help from the staff at the time, but the Intercontinental hotel was great to deal with the following day. I will be back...but I might not chose to wear white!

After our low key visit to the Tonga room we ventured across the road to the Top of the Mark and it was a far better experience. The place was more upmarket with great staff who were friendly and fun. They had a drinks promotion to commemorate the Summer of Love with great cocktails at reasonable prices served with smiles.The views outside the bar at night across the city was worth the trip up to the top floor and it was a nice end to our night .I would recommend this place for a nice evening treat on your visit to this beautiful city

This is a very popular spot for a libation in San Francisco. It is very crowded on the weekends, less so during the week. They do not take reservations, but we only had a 10 minute wait to be seated. We shared a bottle of wine and had 4 sliders (which were excellent). Note: the normal order is for three sliders, but they will add an extra one for an extra $8.00 or so. This proved to be a sufficient light meal after a day of sight-seeing.

Stopped in with the wife and a couple of friends early evening to check out the views.We were not disappointed. Great views right when you step out of the elevator...picture op of the Transamerica building. Then we headed to the bar for a drink as we were not staying for dinner. Bartender was friendly and attentive. He also let me charge my phone!I was quite surprised that they had Chandon for just $40. We enjoyed the city views while sipping the champagne and then headed out. Night time I am sure the experience is different as you get city lights.....we would go back and recommend.

We met friends and really appreciated the leisurely pace -- one of the couple we see maybe once a year and the other it had been quite a few years. Drinks and talk. The service was perfect. He knew when to stop by and never rushed us -- very professional. We probably occupied a table for too long, but there was no pressure. I don't get spirits often (I'm more of a beer or wine guy), but spirits seem to be their specialty. I simply asked for recommendations and was very happy. Of course the view was amazing. We got there early (5pm? on Saturday) and there was a big line when we left.

We were staying at the hotel right next door and ended up visiting TotM 3 times during our week long stay. Get there by 6pm if you want a window seat (or you can ask to wait for one) and stay for sunset (ask for a table on the sunset side). It has a really interesting cocktail list, a good selection of snacks and a lovely atmosphere. The waiters and door people were all friendly and helpful.On our last day, we tried to visit the Tonga Bar in the basement at the Fairmont, but it was jam packed with hotel convention clients (& charges a $10 cover charge if you want a table) so we crossed the road and went back to the top floor TotM for a farewell cocktail in a much more civilised atmosphere.

Went to see the fabled view at the top of the Mark. We were lucky as the skyline was totally clear. The price of the view was cocktails all round. The cocktails themselves were fine but they were fairly knocking them out on the day. Would advise to go early afternoon to avoid the long wait and you can off course have food but we didn't want to stay beyond the cocktails and the view.The views on the day were well worth it.

Awesome views from the Bay to the Golden Gate and beyond. Day or night you will be impressed. Famous cocktail lounge on the 19th floor of the storied Mark Hopkins Hotel atop Nob Hill in picturesque San Francisco. As seen in notion pictures through the years. Excellent service and drinks. Top shelf selections all the way. Expensive but well worth it!!!Not quite the same as "back in the day" when there was a dress code and everything was elegant, but like everything else, times have changed. A must visit for any reason during your stay in the City by the Bay. Highly recommended!

We learned about this place from Sean, our electric bike tour guide from Dylan's Tours. So we had to check it out. I don't believe there is a dress code, but it's definitely better to dress to impress - at least khakis. We were there in the nine o'clock hour of the evening of July 21, and the place was full with a small wait. There was a live band that evening that was terrific - they played great music and managed to get people out on the dance floor consistently. It was fun to listen and watch. The post-sunset nighttime view of the illuminated city was spectacular from high atop this building - the city seemed to stretch on forever. The cocktails aren't exactly cheap ($15 for a Bailey's on the rocks), but it is definitely worth a visit.

One of the perks of being a hotel guest is being able to visit Top of the Mark without paying the $15 cover charge. There was a line when I got out the elevator, but not for long. I really only wanted a quick peak, rather than a drink by myself, but I relented and I'm glad I did. The atmosphere is very stoic and calm, in the company of more sophisticated guests who are likewise there to experience this treat and its stunning views. A bit pricey, but then most good things are in life.

Since we were staying at the hotel, there was no cover charge for us. If you are not a hotel guest, then there is a $15.00 per person cover charge in the evening. Food and wine were ok but you really come up here for the view, drinks, and the live music.We saw quite a few people turn back and leave when they were told about the cover charge which made it a short wait for tables. Much better system I think than the free for all cluster f&^$ that we experienced at "The View" located at the Marriott Marquis which had no host or hostess seating people.

We visited Top of the Mark on my birthday for an after dinner drink, dessert & view of San Francisco. We didn't have a reservation, but only waited about 10 minutes for a table. The drinks and dessert were good, and price-wise about what we expected for an upscale establishment in San Francisco. Our server was friendly & attentive. Wish there had been some music playing...a beautiful piano but no player and therefore nobody was dancing. The weather turned foggy that night, so you couldn't see a whole lot but it still looked cool. Overall, glad we visited Top of the Mark and recommend going when there will be live music playing.

It was only about a 10 minute wait to get a table and we were seated at the window as requested. Everyone working was very pleasant and one gentlemen even went to get my mother a chair to sit in while we waiting.

I was a guest at the Mark Hopkins Hotel and when I arrived I wanted to check out the view and have something to eat and drink, so I went upstairs, You have to wait to be seated and the guy(s) doing so were just very rude and unhelpful. I requested a table by the window, yes given it was a table that could seat 4, all tables were occupied by couples. I saw that one couple was paying and I asked if I could have that table, he insisted to seat me on the bar. Another couple arrived shortly after and they were given that specific table. I asked the guy why he wouldn't give it to me, he said it's a table for 4 and they are a couple. Understood.. However, I am guest of the hotel, this couple wasn't (I overheard their conversation as we were waiting), they only ordered drinks, I orders a full meal and drink, so surely they made more money from me. Seating a single woman on the bar is just very very rude! How does this come across??? Like I am here alone and want to pick up someone??? This is exactly the picture a single woman on the bar portrays. NO! I just wanted to enjoy the view and have a bite to eat after traveling for 30 hours. I am really sorry, but your guys who seat people up there, really need to learn how to treat hotel guests and woman. It was really one of the most rude and embarrassing experiences I have made so far when traveling alone.

Your STAFF can make you or break you !! Top of Mark has a superb staff whose professionalism adds to the overall dining experience. Michael our server was extremely attentive making this special occasion everything we wanted it to be.Brunch is spectacular, appetizers, drinks, Champagne, piano bar, and views. What a great way to spend a special occasion. It is well worth the money with food selections of the like of caviars, prime rib, special seafoods, fruits, vegetables, breads, pastries, vegetables. It's not just a buffet so should not be labeled as such it is a Brunch with high end food items and delicious selections careful thought out and offered in a very festive celebratory way. There are wonderful deserts and food for the most sophisticated palate or "pickie" of palates. We tried 4 types of caviar alone. Reservations are a must and I think for any special occasion you should book in Advance. Top of the Mark is the restaurant on the top floor of the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins Hotel it is a wonderful way to celebrate a special occasion with Sunday Brunch. If you have questions contact Joanna she was so helpful to us in our planning.

Top of the Mark is the restaurant on the top floor of the Mark Hopkins Hotel and well worth the wait time and money.We went for the Sunday Brunch, and was not disappointed with the buffet they had set out.Honestly could not tell you what was my favorite, because I enjoyed everything I tried. The choices maybe be overwhelming, but I don't think you can go wrong.Adding to the atmosphere, was the live entertainment. The piano player was friendly and not above chatting with you.The view of San Francisco is the icing on the cake. This will give you some bearing on the city. There is one particular corner, called the Widows (?) corner. According to the story, this is where the wives of Navy sailors would gather to watch their departing husbands ship leave SF.Just be aware, during the holidays, setting up reservations can be difficult and waiting to get to the restaurant can be time consuming.

Top of the Mark opens to the public at 4:30, so I didn't have the experience Judy Garland sang about: "...climb Nob Hill just to watch it get dark from the Top of the Mark" because it wasn't dark, but this has been on my bucket list for a long time.The "climb Nob Hill" part is accurate - it is a very steep couple of blocks from the Powell and California cable car intersection, but wow, it is worth it! I sat at the bar rather than take up a table by the window for just me, and could see perfectly. The drinks are, as expected, pricey, but hey, who cares? We're hobnobbing with Judy Garland, after all. The 360-degree views are beyond spectacular. Don't even think about going on a cloudy or overcast day - under those circumstances, it's just another very lovely restaurant - but it is a must-see stop on a sunny afternoon or clear evening. Appetizers on the bar menu weren't too bad in price, except that you do pay for the most basic of basics - nuts and chips. I didn't look at the dinner menu so cannot comment on that. Re the question on whether appropriate for kids - well, if "appropriate" means for a bunch of kiddies at a birthday party, the answer is no. If appropriate means would kids have a good dinner there, yes.

There were, however, a huge number of new, tall buildings, which is to be expected in all that time. The drinks waiter was excellent, and looked after us extremely well. The cocktails were also top class, as was our window table. It certainly didn't disappoint in any way after all that time.

We went to the Top of the Mark as it is supposed to be the "it" place. Well I can tell you it is NOT. We walked in to a line of people waiting at the elevator. No wonder they were waiting their elevators are I would bet 100 yrs old!! The elevators are super small to boot. People would get on the elevator and the elevator never failed to beep because according to these ancient elevators people were too heavy and two to three people would have to get off. Then after we waiting for the elevator for 15 minutes we got up to the Top of the Mark. What a cluster!! Tons of people and no where to sit. To get to the bar it was a twenty minute wait. We were so over this place that unfortunately we turned right around to the ancient elevator to take us back to reality. Then finally an employee came and got us and took us down to the first floor in the service elevator. Thank God there weren't more than four of us in the service elevator. Avoid this place at all cost!!!

Absolutely epic view of San Francisco and the bay. Definitely worth seeing. Very elegant room. We read about their famous 100 martini list. It no longer exists. You are lucky to have a dozen to choose from although we were told the current abbreviated list does change occasionally. This was disappointing. Service was slow both times we were there. Prices are very high, especially for Sunday brunch. The worst thing is the waiting area. You step off the elevator and you quite literally have only room for about 6-8 people and the hostess stand. They make EVERYONE wait. We couldn't understand why. In order to avoid this we once arrived right when they opened. They still made us wait. Tables were always available but we had to wait. It is so bad people just stay on the elevators! We just could not understand this.

Our visit to the Top of the Mark" was a planned add-on to our San Francisco visit.We arrived via public transit and some strenuous climbing of surrounding hills. Our quick elevator ride to the top put us in a small lobby area filled with waiting patrons. We added our names to the list and were advised that because we were not staying in the hotel it may take longer; and that our visit was subject to a $10 per person cover charge.It was about 30 minutes before we were seated in the third row of tables away from the windows; but the view was still outstanding.The staff are very friendly, and the entertainment was enjoyable.Glass of wine, a Tequila Sunset, and an order of Nutella Churros $43.00 before tax ~ no additional charge.This is a one time experience, but I am very glad we did it.Highly recommended.

We had a great experience at Top of the Mark. We enjoyed a very pleasant bottle of sparkling wine, the Kobe Beef Sliders and a plate of the spiced olives. Service was very friendly and prompt. The view was magnificent. Tip: Arrive right at 5 pm to get a good evening seat. The restaurant fills up quickly, especially on the weekends.

We didn't have food, but cocktails and the view are a great way to end a day of exploring SF. We had to wait about 10 minutes, but it seemed to turn pretty quickly. 

Best Easter Sunday Brunch Ever!!

Every couple should go here at least once! We've gone twice and a third and fourth time are certain. This is the place to go to be on the top of San Francisco with amazing views all around. We prefer the nighttime view but a clear day view is also spectacular. Go early, or stay aware of tables opening, so you can get one of the tables by the windows, particularly the corner tables near the bar. Enjoy their signature cocktails, like the TOM martini or the Army & Navy. Let the excellent bartenders lead you down the right path. The tapas/small bites offerings are also very good. The wait staff are friendly. The decor is minimal, mostly pictures of days gone by, but that's not the reason to go here. Go for the company you're keeping, the views of a great city, and the conviviality of drinks and tapas.

Top of the Mark's views are amazing when there is no fog. I think the interior needs some sprucing up. The service is good and it is fun with a group.

I had read about WWII military members going to the top of the Mark for a drink and a passionate adieu. So we went for our 51st anniversary. It was very crowded on a Saturday evening aand we could only get a seat at the bar. met some interesting characters there and watched one enjoy several steak sliders appetisers. We only got s few glimpses out the many windows due to the capacity crowd. so maybe next time.

Great views - very expensive

Get there at 4:30 opening so you can get a table for drinks in the evening, it gets packed pretty soon. You can't beat this place. There are only 8 seats at the bar so you will have to get a table but don't worry, at this time nobody is trying to order food, just drinks. If you have never had one of their Old Fashioned's, you haven't lived. Try one, they are not that expensive. Just one. It will do you in. Best view in town if there is a view, with all the fog and rain you never know, but go anyway. You can dress casually.

Thank you to Maitre D, Brian for the delightful table with a view. His kindness in topping off a great day of theatre and beautiful views from Top of the Mark has made my friend and I very happy. We enjoyed the Margherita Flat Bread but nothing beats the view of the bay!

We visited here for my 30th Birthday on our trip to San Francisco. We were only going to visit for one cocktail, but ended up having tapas and a lot more cocktails!The atmosphere was so nice, we watched the sun go down, in one of the best places to see it!Our waiter was impeccable, one of the cocktails I ordered wasn't to my liking, so he replaced it free of charge for another.The live music was great, we got up and danced. Fantastic evening, worth the price tag!

This place was recommended to us and boy were we glad we went. Panoramic view of San Francisco. Whilst you sip into a cold drink. Bar is a little pricey, but for the view it's worth it.

Well it's a neat place to see but our server Mario Acted very put out. He served our drinks to us and placed our appetizers on the table and never came back so our water glasses stayed empty and we were never able to order a second cocktail. The view way amazing the rest was overrated !

As the title says the view is unbelievable but add in an upmarket cocktail bar with delicious food served and it's my idea of heaven.A little pricey for my liking $68 for four G&T's but the view makes it a must do when in the city.

Excellent Views!

The Top of the Mark is at the top of the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins Hotel. The views of the city are stunning. I tried to get a table on Saturday night, but found that the restaurant was quite crowded. However, I came back on Sunday night to find far fewer people. I got a table alone by a window and enjoyed a drink and dessert, which were both excellent. The bartender was accommodating to my request to alter one ingredient in the drink I ordered.

Top view but how about all the rest?

In my mind, the Top of the Mark is a kind of 'view places'. It was an amazing panorama of SF lights but nothing bigger. We weren't residents of intercontinental so we had to pay extras of course, so that I was kind of disillusioned about this place. Music was too loud (but anyway so beautiful big thanks to the Adele piano man) everybody were trying to outvoice it and it was a terrible hubbub all over the place. Food there was not very impressive but ok, so delicious desserts but VERY expensive and low quality tea seriously (I got the idea that people visit this place not to drink tea but I love tea and it was really disappointing so sad). To sum up, it is an ok place for tourists visiting SF for the first time.

Cool place

pricey food, but it is worth the try. After all, it is on the top of the hotel, and provides great service and the great environment. I loved every moment in there! parking is awful and the walk to the hotel is pretty tiring (uphill). take uber! 

Great for happy hour to watch the sunset.

This is a great spot for sunset but you have to you arrive very early in order to get a spot at the bar. You can get dining reservations as well but we enjoy going for a sunset glass of wine.

I was there for a drink, the view and some nostalgia in the late afternoon on a Friday and it was packed. It was a sunny day and the view was beautiful and the service was great. I had one drink, no food and the waiter was still attentive. I tipped appropriately for that. The first time I was up there was the early 60's and the last time 20 years ago or so. At that time the bar was in the middle of the room and there was window seating all around. Now, the bar is against the southern windows. The view is still great, just less of it. What I SHOULD have had was the Foggy Martini for $40.00, made with distilled fog! I tell everyone about that!

Pricey, but FABULOUS!!

I had heard of the Top of the Mark for years. Schedules just never worked out to be there for Sunday brunch ... until last week. FABULOUS! Truly FABULOUS! Five stars over and over and over.With more than 50 choices (yes, I counted!!) for caviar, soups, veggies, breads, fruits, salads, entrees, desserts, etc., etc., and with each more scrumptious than one could ever imagine, and with champagne glasses that were always refilled without ever asking, one is willing to overlook the high cost of the "event." And I call it an "event" with the highest kudos possible.And table 62 offers the best of the best views of the city, too.Do it .. at least once in your lifetime. You won't regret it!!

We didn't have dinner, but enjoyed a drink as we watched the sun set over the city. The service was friendly, the views fabulous. Come early enough to avoid the crowds - when we left, there was a line to come in.

The decor is tired and from a bygone era but somehow it has a charm that works. Clearly the views over San Francisco are wonderful (assuming good weather!) and the main reason for going there, but it is still a fun place to get for a pre- or post dinner drink. (There is a food menu as well though).

Sunday Brunch

Our first visit to San Francisco we were lucky enough to become acquainted with a gentlemen who loves San Francisco and has many years history here. He insisted we be his guests at Sunday Brunch at the Mark-- we had never heard of it, and let me tell you-- it was fabulous.The setting is ridiculously awesome. Gorgeous Mark Hopkins Hotel- historical and beautiful building with views to die for of the entire area. We were looking at the Golden Gate Bridge along with half the city from our table!The food?! Not one thing was less than fabulous. Every single bite of anything we tried was delicious!!! The service?! You couldn't drink a swallow of your champagne and set your glass down without it being topped back off! I swear that's not an exaggeration!! The service was excellent. I know it's an expensive Brunch but I think for a real treat and if it's a special weekend- it's a must do and we plan to do the Brunch our next time in San Francisco. My husband and I both enjoyed it immensely. Also the elevator to the top won't even take you up until right at 10am when. Ranch starts so if you're there ten min early do what we did- our friend walked us across the street to the lobby of the Fairmont hotel- another jaw dropping gorgeous old hotel- so that we could have a peak at its beauty. San Francisco is such a neat city- we will be back- perfect lovers getaway weekend!

The view from the Top of the Mark is well worth it. I would say don't waste it on the kids my teenagers were not nearly as impressed as we were and the food is great but not kid friendly.

We were staying nearby so decided to try Top of the Mark for a pre-dinner drink. Good (and pricey) drinks. Very limited menu items. The view and history of the Bar is well worth the price of a drink or two.
