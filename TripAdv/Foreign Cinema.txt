I had the lavender goat cheese which was noteworthy and the Kobe steak which was also very good. For dessert I had the apple pie which was great! But the BEST thing about this restaurant was the ambiance. It has a movie playing in the outside seating area with beautiful little lights hanging. Very cute!

My son and I dined at Foreign Cinema when we were on a short stay in San Francisco in October 2017. What a gem! We booked for 6pm and had a table in the main dining room which is so charming. The big fireplace and the beautiful big fresh flower arrangement in the centre of the minimalist industrial decor room contributed to the overall ambience. Service was prompt and professional. We started with Warm Mediterranean mixed olives followed by the half Dungeness Crab which was delectable. My son had the Sesame Crusted Chicken while I had the Fillet of Duck. Both were outstanding! Highly recommended as a fine dining experience.

Foreign Cinema is about the only restaurant I return to every time I have the chance of staying in SFO. Great food and nice setting in the heart of the Mission. One only thing - it is loud, as is the case in too many restaurants in the U.S. - quit this or at least offer some quiet times!

i live in the area so have visited this place on and off for years and not sure i'll go back again. pros: food is very good. squid starter unusual and delish as was the flat iron steak cooked perfectly. ahi and pork chop good. fun to watch old films while eating. $15 valet parking as its a royal pain in that area. cons: portions, especially starters, are tiny for price especially brie and smoked trout. service was slow. we brought some very special wine to celebrate and got bit by the 2 bottle limit. corkage is $30 which isn't usual for sf but the 2 bottle rule is and there are so many other better ways to handle this (like just charge more corkage for subsequent bottles.) ended up paying just over $100 per person including corkage for the 2 bottles we shared. probably last time there as there are too many fantastic options in the city with a better overall experience.

The day was sunny, the doors open to the patio, and the feeling just right for brunch. We started with oysters and the salmon picnic. Loved the salmon eggs on top. Loved the selection of raw oysters. A glass of Italian rose proved a fine pairing. The meal finished exquisitely with grape granita with wild strawberry sorbet. So light and delicate on the tongue. The reservation was definitely worth it.

Absolutely delicious!

We were here for a wedding rehearsal dinner. It is such a professional restaurant. The food and service were amazing. The atmosphere is unique. A huge screen plays an interesting old film (without sound) providing an entertains back drop.

Had a reservation but arrived just over an hour early, it was super busy so couldn't fit us in before our reserved time. Ended up eating by the bar which wasn't too bad at all. The lady who greeted us I think could have given us regular updates on our likelihood at being seated before time but it appeared that she just didn't bother.The food and wine was nice. The atmosphere had lots of vibes. Very pricey. The area isn't one I felt comfortable in after nightfall. The film that was showing was The Princess Bride. Never watched it before but I understand it's a cult classic. If in San Francisco again I wouldn't go back.

I highly recommend getting an outdoor seating when going to this restaurant. The mix of the lights as well as the movie playing on the wall adds to a very romantic atmosphere.The meal is not inexpensive, but you get great quality. Both of us loved our starters and main courses. Best of all was the service. Our waitress was a true professional and we could not have ask for better. Some reviewers have commented on the restaurant being loud, but I felt the tables were far enough apart we could easily have a conversation with each other. There is no denying that the space has a dynamic atmosphere to it, but for us that added to the experience.

Went here with my bestie last week through a friend's recommendation. Loved it. Atmosphere was fun, good food and you get to watch a good old classic film while you dine - what more could you want? :)I would have given it a 5 star but it was quite windy when we went so it was a tad cold. But would highly recommend! Service was really good too!

the building in which this restaurant is situated is interesting. A hip place. The food was generally good although the clam dish was too salty. Service was fast, excellent and very friendly. the one negative aspect was the noise level. With so many guests it was very noisy and it became hard for us to hear each other.

We had a delicious dinner and outstanding friendly service. The atmosphere is fun and casual and conducive to engaging your neighbors in conversation. There is an indoor dining area that gets noisy and an outdoor one that is quieter and has the bonus attraction of being able to watch the signature outdoor movie screen if you are there past dusk. Heaters keep the temperature pleasant outdoors.The food was creative and tasty and moderately priced. The wine selection is outstanding. I have never seen a better or more diverse selection of intriguing wines by the glass.

Atmosphere was amazing - even without a movie playing in the background (I think we went to early, 5:30 reservation). I would have loved to know ahead of time that they only play movies at dark (I only overheard the table of locals next to me saying that was why nothing was playing). Aside from that minor hiccup, dinner was delicious. We got 3 starters, that were all pretty light - but that was great because our 2 mains, the Sea Bass and their signature chicken, really filled us up. Not too much so that we didn't save space for a cheesecake - which was the highlight of the meal for me! The service was unreal - could not fault it at all!

I decided to have a long and relaxing lunch at the Foreign Cinema a couple of weekends ago and as I was alone, I was very happy to see the counter and received a warm welcome from the front of house and the bar staff.I opted to kick things off with half a dozen oysters from Vancouver as well as a Pilsner from Fort Bragg and I was very happy with this start! Moving on to a main course of grilled yellowtail Jack with Moroccan spiced cauliflower and progressing to a much stronger Green Flash Coast IPA that worked extremely well!Lunch was delicious and I opted to move back to a few more of the Pilsners and got chatting with the bar staff. It was a good afternoon, a lazy lunch that was followed by a 4 mile walk in the sunshine and I am greatly looking forward to returning again next time I am in town!

FC has both an interior and and outdoor seating area. Unless it is filthy out, sit outside if you can. There are many heaters and it is sheltered from most of the wind, and it is fun. Wherever you sit, if you are into wine, spend some time with the list. It is huge, and very interesting, with good choices available by the glass and several tasting flights that let you try new things. Service is attentive, professional and our server was very knowledgeable about the food, wine and drinks. As to the food, it was simply great. An unusual calamari starter with an impressive mole sauce was generous, delicious and fit for sharing. Carpaccio was beautifully presented, and a vegetarian soup disappeared immediately. The mains kept up the action, with a delicious pork chop and superb fried chicken most enjoyed. Don't be put off by the Mediterranean spicing of the chicken, it is subtle and delicious. A good vegetarian risotto rounded things out, but made you wish the vegetarians had more choices of mains that reflected the talent in the kitchen. Desserts were also excellent, with the cheesecake being the winner, as our server advised. Oh, and don't try to stay for the whole movie, you can't really hear it anyway, and I understand that that is not encouraged. But, it makes for an even more fun evening, punctuated by heat food. 

Thumbs up experience!

Our first time to Foreign Cinema in the Mission District was for brunch. Everything was outstanding. Wide range on menu. Must start with picnic menu items of sticky bun and organic pop tart. Their take on these is crazy good. Great bar with brunch standards, newly imaginative cocktails and extensive wine list. Eggs all ways, duck, bacon, French toast etc. all great! Now must go back for dinner menu and a movie!

Reservations a must

A hot spot with locals. We originally made reservations with the thought the movie idea was unique. If that is part of the experience you want you have to be sure your reservation is after dark. Ours was too early for the movie, but we enjoyed the people watching along with a very nice meal. I started with a martini which was served in a wine glass. I am a traditionalist in the martini department so would have preferred a martini glass. There is a very extensive wine list and our server guided us to a very nice pinot noir . I started with their corn soup which was yummy then onto the duck which was cooked perfectly and very tender, one of the best duck I've enjoyed. Desert was cheese cake. Service was very good and professional and not intrusive. It can get very noisy so it can be challenging if you want a quite intimate conversation, or if someone is hearing challenged.

I've been eating at Foreign Cinema since it opened, and these days I not only marvel at the amazing menu, service & setting but also that they can deliver an experience today that is as good, if not better, than when they first opened their doors.Much as I do love the film projection in the courtyard - and try and book a table outside - it is really just a backdrop, and not meant as a great cinema experience. So don't sweat it if you can't get seated outside, or the film isn't one you like.

Hmmmm for all the hype I was greatly disappointed. I came from Ann Arbor, MI to visit my daughter in SF. She said she had heard great things about Foreign Cinema and made the reservations weeks ago.Our drinks came but not cold enough. Appetizers delivered in timely fashion but then we waited waaaay too long for our dinners. Mediocre service. Small portions. Decent food but just not worth the price.

Dined with wife and in-laws while on holiday. Fresh, clean food. I ordered the Baked goats cheese as a starter and backed it up with the dry-aged new york steak... both were excellent.

Was visiting San Francisco and always had a good experience eating here but this time it was marred with a serious attitude problem exhibited by the hostess.

Ate here second week of June. Complex menu and great food. Waiter Leo was awesome in his patience and suggestions for both food and wine. Tried the oysters (much different than Guld of Mexico oysters), June antipasto, and cocoa rubbed steak. My wife never eats red meat and loved it. Thisd menu changes daily so the main items change daily. My wife is wine lover and I'm a beer lover. Leo helped my wife pick a bottle of wine and got their beer connoisseur Eric involved in helping me on beer. Hit 2 of my 5 top beers in my life. they want you to enjoy the experience and atmosphere. WE DID!!. No rush, great food, great spirits!!!

This restaurant's promise of a romantic experience having dinner under soft lights while watching a foriegn movie seems like the perfect place to have dinner in San Francisco right?? Unfortunately, this restaurant has forgotten the key element of eating in San Francisco - great food. Fortunately, the company of my beautiful girlfriend made up for the mediocre dishes. If you are visiting San Francisco and are looking for great dining experience , I suggest you try Gary Danko or one of the many other fine restaurants in the City.

Industrial chic
Rating: 4
Date: June 1, 2017
Foreign Cinema is a fine dining restaurant in the buzzing San Fran Mission District with a cinema attached (in a separate outdoor courtyard section) for those who fancy a movie with their 3 course meal. It's a good idea and a definite point of difference. I have heard the setting described as "industrial chic" which is pretty accurate. I'm not sure where the "Foreign" comes from (maybe it used to be a foreign film cinema that was turned into a restaurant?) though as the night we visited they were showing 'Gravity' with Sandra Bullock which is not a foreign/independent film.The food was good and service friendly, though there were a few long waits for drinks and some incorrect billing, which the staff dealt with well. I tried the beef sirloin carpaccio (not what I was expecting, the meat was cut incredibly thin and whilst the flavours were good, I didn't feel it was worth the $17 price), skipped main ("california features") and had the pistachio cake & cardamon ice cream for dessert (fantastic)All in all, a very good restaurant (listed as one of San Francisco's best in many local guides) and worth a visit, especially given the attached cinema. The bar adjacent to Foreign Cinema, Laszlo (turn left as you exit toward the street down the red carpet) is excellent with great vibes and excellent music (some nice 90's dance tunes the night we attended), so I'd recommend a visit on the way out.

This is definitely a unique dining experience. We arrived early to find parking (highly recommended or hire a car) and chose the outdoor seating although it was a rather cool, crisp afternoon/evening. The outdoor seating is akin to dining in a large open courtyard with a movie screen on the far wall, and lovely outdoor strung lighting to create a fine ambiance. The wine list is extensive and terrific with a broad selection of wines by the glass. We began with a fine seasonal salad, seasoned to perfection with herbs and a select cheese. The Beef Carpaccio was unusual and unique in its presentation, but unremarkable in taste--too much going on there. Foreign Cinema is known for its Sesame Fried Chicken, which was excellent, succulent and tasty. Members of our party also enjoyed the sirloin and steak selections. Finished with a chocolate pot de creme and a wonderful port. Great evening - but a bit pricey!

This is an unusual imaginative restaurant with a great menu and wine list.The food is a little different and very well presented. Try the salt cod if on when you visit.I have given 4 rather than 5 stars because of slightly over confident service which resulted in a couple of admittedly minor problems. Would definitely return.Area a little rough, drive or take a cab.

So this setting is unique you dine under the stars and fairy lights. A great menu with dishes that can easily be shared. The Sommelier was amazing and he happily helped us select our wine according to our tastes. As the sky darkens they screen old movies on the wall... so much fun. The staff are friendly and really look after you. Just make sure you take an extra layer of clothing as you are outside however the outdoor heaters were fabulous. A fun experience for all of the family.

The "Baked fromage in a fig leaf" sounded great, but was ruined by having the olivada with made it like eating salted cheese... for me, salted to the point of being inedible!If I returned for the wine, I'd order only bread and butter, which was good and all that I could eat.

we (2 couples) enjoyed an early 5:30 dinner on Friday, and preferred the inside sitting. The restaurant filled up fast and noise level increased dramatically. Comprehensive wine list with 0.5 L carafes available along with regular size bottles. We had warm olives and baked brie as appetizers, duck confit and pork chops as main, along with bottle of Zin... followed with 2 shared deserts and tea/coffee. All were good, with duck confit not overloaded with high calories sides, just some greens-which was good. Service was reasonably good, valet parking available for $15. As far as movies are concerned, they would show it when its becoming dark....later in the evening, but I think movies is not a main attraction. All in all, good food and service if you do not mind a noisy environment

We met friends for brunch on Sunday and were pleased we had made reservations well in advance as there was a wait for walk-ins. There were six of us and we were seated at a large table right in the middle of one of the rooms. We started with oysters and each of us had a different dish. Each rated their meal from good to great and our service was very good. Although the room had high open ceilings the noise level was also high.

One of my best friends got married in SF in April and chose Foreign Cinema for her 'reception' dinner. We were seated upstairs on the mezzanine level with a beautiful view looking down over the main dining area and the garden. The servers were wonderfully friendly and attentive - we were never left wanting for anything. The menu was a set one, but every dish was not only beautiful to look at but delicious to eat. I had Lavender Baked Goat Cheese for a starter, Pacific Tuna Seared Rare for my entree and the Creme Caramel for dessert. I wouldn't have changed a single thing as I was pleasantly surprised by each and every dish.

I visited for first time as a place for dinner before attending a Theater production that was not far. We arrived just at opening time, about 5pm, and while you may not expect much as you walk in, once your are inside the setting is fun. We sat in the open area in the center which while open still has protection should it rain. There is this large wall at one side, multiple stories (side of adjacent building) where they project old movies. I loved the setting and was very pleased with the menu and service - both was wonderful. I started with a cocktail that was unique and wonderful. For a main course I had a lobster special that was outstanding. We also shared some appetizers at the start and dessert at the end. We told them we needed to get out at a certain time, and they were great about it. I definitely plan to come back.

Been here several times over the years and sort of take things for granted, as I don't remember having a bad meal. Had friends in from New York and wanted to take them to something that was different than what they have experienced and did not want to do something "crazy"...thought the "Foreign Cinema" would be a bit different and hopefully memorable...it didn't let me down! Our table had the Miyagi Oysters, my standard - they were fresh, Smoked Salmon - nothing to write home about, carpaccio - had better, Sea Bass - which was moist and done perfect, Duck Breast - excellent, the New York - cooked as ordered, and the Pasta, which I don't order but my guest had a desire for some, was done nicely! We ended up sharing every dish and while stuffed, ended up ordering the Goats Milk to share as our dessert. We all ordered wine by the glass and each one said they enjoyed theirs. Our guests were delighted and indicated on their next trip, they would not mind coming here again.

We booked Foreign Cinema for a special meal on our honeymoon. We booked well in advance and requested a nice table outside. When we arrived, we were seated at probably the worst table in the whole restaurant - inside, next to the fireplace so that I was sitting next to a wall. I asked the (very uninterested) woman at the front desk if we could be moved outside and was informed that if we wanted to go outside, we'd have to go on a list. Massively disappointing as technically, we'd been on the list for a month! There was another guy at the front desk (potentially a manager) and when I got back to our table, he came over straight away and moved us outside. He also gave us both a tiny glass of fizz to acknowledge that we were on honeymoon. The patio is absolutely gorgeous and we were much happier once we were outside. Our server was also friendly and attentive. The wine list is very comprehensive but very pricey - the majority of reds are $100+. The food menu had lots of things we fancied but we went for the beef carpaccio and the calamari which were both good, but there was actually very little calamari in the calamari dish - it was a very small bowl of spiced chickpea stew with a few bits of squid, served with a load of tortilla chips. For mains, we ordered the fried chicken and the bavette steak. The first thing we noticed was the vast difference in the amount of food on our plates. The fried chicken dish was huge and the steak was tiny. It had already been cut up and the presentation was probably designed to disguise the fact that it wasn't a full steak. There were also only two or three tiny bits of potato on my plate. It did taste good though and luckily my husband donated some of his chicken to me so that I didn't leave hungry. A shared chocolate pot for pudding was decent but nothing special. Foreign Cinema has all the ingredients to be a great place but at the moment, it's a little bit style over substance.

The atmosphere of this restaurant is gorgeous and one of the main things that makes up for the menu and food. Their bar selection is also amazing and I had a delicious cognac while waiting for our table. The food was not what I expected. For the price (and the selection) I expected fresher oysters, a more delicious shrimp cocktail, amazing entrees. The oysters I ordered were okay, and one was definitely not my favorite. They weren't served along with much (though had they been amazing freshness and quality they wouldn't have needed much.) The prawn cocktail was just okay. My entree tasted like salty rice-a-roni. My date's entree, the pork, was much better though and I did enjoy the bites I had of his. All in all, I've definitely paid a lot less and got much better food. But the restaurant looks unique and is a fun spot to see. Not sure if I would return, unless only to sit at their bar.

Had to Google just about everything on this menu because I didn't recognize so many of the different things that came in each dish. Came with a group of 8 and we all got something different, shared 3-4 bottles of wine and ended up paying about $80 per person with appetizers and dessert. Very cool restaurant and a lot of bars and stuff to do afterword. Good for a date or for big groups. Service was impeccable, food was amazing and reasonably priced. You're probably going to have to eat something you've never had before, but that's a good thing, right? Make a reservation at least a week in advance though.

We had dinner with a group at Foreign Cinema last week. We were upstairs in the restaurant and we could see they played a movie on the wall. I had the carpaccio as a starter and it tasted really nice. It was the thinnest sliced carpaccio ever, but it tasted very good. As a main course I had the swordfish which I also liked. Some of the group were somewhat disappointed in the chicken though. Overall good food but maybe a bit overrated.

We were really looking forward to visiting Foreign Cinema as part of our honeymoon trip to San Fran. The interiors are beautiful with a relaxed & cool atmosphere. We were greeted at the front desk by a very accommodating lady who managed to squeeze us in earlier than our pre-booked reservation which was very helpful!We were then seated by another lady who did not smile, speak or do anything but walk us to the table and then walk off abruptly. The menu was a dream! There was plenty to choose from and each dish sounded more delicious than the next. I opted for the sea bass and my husband went for a trio of meats dish. The waitress who took our order was quite taken aback that we did not order starters, only main dishes, and then seemed disgruntled again when I opted for a lemonade over an alcoholic drink. We waited a very long time for our drinks which arrived just before the food. The food itself was absolutly delicious, we could not fault it! It was very filling so we were glad we did not opt for starters (we are not used to American portions just yet!). We were offered the dessert menu which I browsed and then declined which seemed to agitate our waitress even more.When the bill arrived it was around $70 and we put down a $100 bill. The waitress asked if we would like change which we responded that we would - worst mistake ever. She then stormed off to the cash desk where she spoke to a waiter who looked like he could have been a manager. The two then proceeded to openly talk about us and laugh between themselves. It then took around 20minutes before the change arrived to the table, at which point my husband had already got up to leave. It was such a shame our experience was ruined by such rude staff as the atmosphere (minus the staff) and the food was absolute perfection! We had just been on a long flight before we arrived, we were tired and did not fancy a three course meal with lashings of alcohol (as I normally would!) but we should not have been judged on that. We were planning to come the following night to properly enjoy the restaurant again however we changed our plans and wouldn't return based on our experience.

This is a terrific hip restaurant in the Mission ... with valet service. Superb food, expansive, fair wine list, excellent wait staff. Easy access with curbside valet in a tough area to park. Unique interior.

Was here on a Friday night with a couple of friends and had made a reservation beforehand. The reception was a little cold. We got a choice of sitting outside or inside, and since it was a little windy in the courtyard (our table only had one heater rather than a heater on each end), we decided to sit inside. The waitress was patient with us changing our minds multiple times as to where to sit.At this point I don't remember what we got, but I do know that if someone were to bring me here on a date, I'd be impressed.

We totally enjoyed our dinner at Foreign Cinema. Besides the great food and service, the setting and atmosphere of the restaurant is wonderful with high ceilings and minimalist, stylish decor. They even screened Dirty Dancing on the wall of the covered patio section of the restaurant. The grilled coffee-rubbed Kobe bavette was excellent. The only slight hiccup was that we had to wait quite a while for our food as there was a large group that night, although our waiter was extremely apologetic throughout.

We had an amazing meal at Foreign Cinema. This restaurant was highly recommended to us so expectations were high. Foreign Cinema did not disappoint! Both my husband and I got the swordfish and it was perfect. Absolute perfection! To top things off the cheesecake was marvelous. One of the best meals we have ever had!

Foreign Cinema's been killin' it for a while now but they keep it fresh and fun. It's a truly unique dining experience. Each of their three dining rooms (the middle one being a covered dining patio) are unique. We sat in the patio and it was great fun having Dirty Dancing playing on the wall. The appetizers were tasty and my steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sommelier knew his stuff and recommended a very good Spanish wine for those having fish and my half bottle of a little known but awesome cab. My only gripe was that the bathroom was a mess. And hey, just about everyone visits the facilities at some point during a leisurely meal. The physical restroom was just fine, but the patrons hadn't been very neat and clearly no one from the restaurant had stopped in to keep things in order. I'm hoping this was just an aberration or an off night for the crew because an establishment that attends so well to so many of the other details of running a truly fine dining establishment shouldn't tolerate letting their guests feel like they've just stepped into the bus station when they stepped away to use the restroom.

My daughter recommended this restaurant. It was our last night in san fransisco. A bit away from where our hotel was in sutter street but her friend had recommended we go. We took the Bart and walked about 10 mins to this restaurant. Glad we went as the place was a lovely atmosphere and the staff are wonderful. It is a bit pricey . I had Sesame Fried chicken and moroccan - spiced cauliflower. We sat in the main restaurant rather than the conservatory. We were made to feel very welcome and the staff are amazing and very attentive. Because of the staff and the the food was first class I would recommend this restaurant. It was a great place to go before we flew back to Scotland the next day. Really made our holiday a special last night. Lovely place great staff and atmosphere the food is first class.

The food was delicious. I had the duck and it was perfect. We were happy to be seated outside (they have heaters) where they project a movie on the wall. Lights are strung giving it a homey feel, like I was at my friend's house on their patio. Service was a bit slow but the place was packed, so I understand. Plan ahead and make reservations. You will be glad you went!

Went here to have a birthday dinner with my boyfriend. They were willing to keep my surprise birthday cake. Our waitress, Melanie (I think) was super nice and friendly. The entrance was a red carpet which was sooooo cool. I don't think anybody really watch the movie but the ambience is great. The outdoor seat is pretty cold despite the many outdoor heaters. The food was BOMB. Great for the price.

Overall, really like the vibe of this place. Beautiful space, food was really good, some issues, though with service.We had a 5:30 reservation (they open at 5:30) and were made to wait outside the restaurant until that time. I noticed one couple was allowed to go in early - they clearly were not employees and that was confirmed when they were seated at a table next to ours. I was annoyed. It was freezing and it would have been nice to be able to at least wait inside. Once we were shown to our table, we sat and waited. An employee finally came to the table and informed us they were printing out the menu. Really??? In my opinion, if you're going to drop $300 on dinner for 3 people, the menu should be ready to go by 5:30 when they open. At about 5:45, our server finally came to the table and took our drink order. At first, I thought she was a front-of-the-house person jumping in to help. She wasn't very friendly, but nice enough. When we finally got our menus we ordered our app and dinner. We ordered crab legs to share probably could have done without as they were nothing special. For dinner, my son ordered the sea scallops, rock cod, mussels, spiced sausage, in broth; my husband ordered the mahi mahi, and I ordered the pork chop. My son loved his dish and my husband/I liked ours very much. Desserts were excellent. We ordered the chocolate pot de creme and the butterscotch pudding. So good. I guess if I were to summarize, I would say the ambiance is wonderful, concept is super cool, food was very good, service was just okay. Also, not cool allowing certain special people early entry while the rest of us wait outside. I might go back for the chicken, which I heard was great. We'll see.

Striking art on the walls, three very different "vibes" in each of the three large dining areas, with a menu that was difficult to choose from because everything sounded so good. The service was professional and classy. Our meals were delicious - we ordered the warm olives to start, a stuffed quail appetizer and a beet salad (both excellent) and then two very different main courses: kobe steak and a sesame fried chicken. Both of us were impressed by the meal and the value. A lovely evening in SF.

Is Foreign Cinema. The adjoining cocktail bar is a great place to linger while waiting for a for a table, but don't take the risk of missing out and OpenTable a reservation if you can. Definitely start with a cocktail - they're excellent. We decided on several small dishes to sample as much had as we could from the menu. Everything was great .. not just good, but considered, appealing and beautifully presented. There's great care taken with the glassware to enhance the extensive wine list, and wine fans might enjoy the 'flights' available, which again allowed us to taste as broadly as possible. Service was attentive, the terrace and dining area smart, atmospheric and slightly whimsical. We weren't uncomfortably squashed in either - rare in our dining experiences in the city. It's way more than novelty dining - we loved it and it was a great final night dinner in the city. Take an extra layer - I found the temperature on the low side despite the fire, but not enough to detract from the experience. Oh - and they do show movies while you dine. Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious!

The place is good, the neighborhood a little seedy! Love the movie playing in the background, we went with kids and they loved it. There are old fashioned heavy, metal sturdy Drive-Inn speakers which you can put on your table if wanted. The food is very good and original! It was hard getting a reservation for 8 people and took the only one available at 21:30! This was the only issue, because 2 people in our party arrived a little late because of car trouble and were told that they had to order immediately because the kitchen was closing. Did not appreciate that!! San Francisco is not Duluth! If you take late reservations, then you feed your customers late! Other than that, the place is definitely a good spot for a new original restaurant with very good food.

For something a tad different, try this quirky but elegant restaurant in the Mission. There are 3 rooms to choose from--an art gallery-type room, a covered outdoor patio, and an elegant room with a fireplace. The food was fantastic--better than I expected--and the service was really great. We were there on a cold January night, and it was warm inside or out (plenty of heat lamps on the patio) with Mary Poppins playing on the big screen. We sang along with a neighboring table full of Brits. It's just an interesting mix of chi chi and kitch! Would definitely go again.

Watching Mary Poppins on a chilly wintry night with wonderful food could be, and was, entrancing. The front of house really let this lovely restaurant and themed food place down, lacking any charm or ability to make welcome even when, as we had, booked. However the bar area, bar staff are what make this place exceptionally good, they are knowledgable not only on the wines but the menu and are everything FOH are not, welcoming, keen to let you try the wine before you buy and offer alternatives to go with the menu choices you make - would I return - you bet, the food is beautifully served, cooked and delicious just remember that you wont be welcomed with much charm!

The restaurant delivers on all fronts. The food is exquisite with an eclectic interpretation of modern dishes. The service was thoughtful and courteous; however, what brings the restaurant to another level is the setting and the people. A seat on the patio is a must with the theater playing on the big screen in the background. If it's a warm day in The City, then you may never leave the table. The fusion of a gastronome's delight and the visual splendor of the restaurant makes for a memorable experience.

This place is a Home run! Large outdoor patio and a beautiful indoor space with fireplace and a pretty bar. It is always hard to hit the mark with beautiful or interesting interiors and excellent food. This place does it all. It's one of those menus that you want to order everything listed as everything sounds so good and it is. We had a group of 7 so we ordered several appetizers, lavender goat cheese, their version of nachos and calamari. All INCREDIBLE. Great drinks and wine list and everyone raved about their meals from the champagne omelettes to even a hamburger that was better than most. We had brunch but it must be fun to come at night when they show films on the back outdoor patio wall for ambiance. Just a cool place in the Mission District. About a 12 minute drive from Union Square.

We were visiting San Francisco for three days and we've been told to go to Foreign Cinema by a friend of us who lives in SFO.We didn't seat in the movie room, but I've preferred to stay "inside".Food was absolutely delicious and it has been the only place in US where we 've ordered wine, really delightful.It was a little bit too noisy, maybe because the restaurant has an informal attitude starting from service.

Foreign Cinema derives its name from the fact that it shows a foreign film (sound muted) in one of the dining areas. "Casablanca" was on view the night we were there. Not foreign, but who's quibbling? We were a three generation group of eight. The menu is manageable and a kid's menu is offered, unusual for a restaurant like this. We had a variety of appetizers and entrees, all of which were outstanding. The sesame fried chicken was especially good. Service was attentive. My only complaint is that my pork chop was slightly overcooked.Foreign Cinema is deserving of its listing in the Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants.

What a Disappointment

What an incredibly disappointing evening. I'd dined at this restaurant before and had excellent experiences on all occasions. I visited on a Saturday night in October 2016 and had a terrible experience.We arrived on-time for our reservation and learned that our table was not ready. The host and hostess were "too cool for school" types that were non-apologetic for our table not being ready and acted as if we should be falling all over ourselves to even have the chance to dine here, even as we hit 30 minutes past our reservation time. I am very happy to wait 10-15 minutes after a reservation, but when it hits 30, I think that a restaurant owes you (a) updates, (b) an apology, and (c) if they're serious, a glass of wine or a cocktail while you wait. This place offered none of the three and, in fact, really had no place to stand other than right in front of the host station. So, our meal got off to both a disappointing and obnoxious start.Sadly, it seems the obnoxious, holier-than-thou vibe has infected not only the host and hostess at this establishment, but the servers too. We sat at our table and waited a full 15 minutes to even be recognized by a server. He did not introduce himself and just said "Drinks?" to kick-off the meal. Throughout the meal, he avoided eye contact with us, seemed generally annoyed that he had to be working a busy Saturday night, and showed zero interest in if we were liking the food, cocktails, or wine.And, by the way: we weren't liking them. While the menu had appealing options, the food was completely hit-and-miss and the pasta dish we had was served completely lukewarm.While the restaurant still has a great atmosphere, that and popularity do not make a great meal. Service and food here have gone substantially downhill; we paid a lot of money for an unpleasant experience with disinterested service bordering on obnoxious. San Francisco has way too many superb restaurants for you to waste your time on this one.

We had a reservation for four and were not offered a seat in the "movie" room. Only half of the seating area is in the part of the restaurant where one could see the film. No one really watches a movie over dinner but it is touted as the ambiance so disappointing not to see that room. We waited in the crowded bar and had typical complicated concoctions at $15-16/each. Fresh seafood apps were good, one vegan was nicely accommodated with a full veggie/grain option (no vegan options on the menu), duck and ahi main courses were excellent and risotto was disappointingly bland. Wine list is pricey and long. Overall the experience was fine but not what it should be in this price range and with all of the great options in the city.

We made reservations months in advance for this place, on the advice of friends. The interior itself is very, very loud and hard to hear each other talk over brunch. We were with a group of four, trying to decide which items we wanted to split. We made sure to check with our server that all the items on the menu were available before ordering, and she assured us they were, which dictated what we chose. Part way through she came back to say, actually, no, half of what we ordered wasn't available which changed the table's order in terms of splitting, etc. But then said half the orders had already been processed and she couldn't cancel them. In the end it led to us having to basically each eat our meals at different times, with food we would not have chosen. No apologies and fairly rude about the whole ordeal. It also took a lot of flagging in order to get coffee refills, basic service. Considering how expensive this place is, would have expected better. One exception was the french toast which was superb.
