There were a group of 6 of us, and we started with fried calamari and mussels in wine sauce. Both were VERY good. For appetizers, our group ranged from Pasta Carbonara, to Prime Rib, to Swordfish. All came away very full and with sated palates. We were hoping to find a mid-range , classic, Italian American dining experience, and that we did.

Original Joe's was recommended to us by the son of our traveling companions. We made a reservation and went to dinner. Immediately when we got there we felt like family. From the Maitre 'd t, our waiter, the chef and then the owner, we were treated like royalty. Amazing food!!! Wonderful dining experience. My only regret is that it may be a while before we can come back here. If the opportunity to eat here presents itself, don't let it pass you by. First class!!

Wanted to take a visiting relative from Germany out for a "San Francisco Experience" so for the dinner we choose Joe's. Once again it was perfect. Service staff were friendly yet professional, always there when needed but not hovering. We were there at 5:30 and it was about a third full. By 6:00 it was going full steam and lots of fun. Food was great of course. The swordfish/chappino was fabulous although the Caesar Salad wasn't anything to write home about. My wife got the Joe's Sole and loved it although there was enough for two. Janosch had the Chicken Marsala and loved it. Calamari was fantastic, melted in your mouth. Not cheap but then you are in the heart of North Beach at a fantastic place with great old SF atmosphere. Valet parking for $12!

Situated in the heart of little Italy this restaurant meets the needs of the visitor looking for the classic iconic american Italian restaurant experience. Formally dressed waiters serve a classic old fashioned menu in red leather booth surroundings. We had a great meal washed down with a carafe of local Pinot Noir. All very satisfying

My friend and I decided to try the iconic Original Joe's on a Saturday night. I had made dinner reservations for 8:15pm and they called me earlier in the afternoon to confirm my ressie. We ended up being about 30 mins early, but the hostess cheerfully sat us at a table. The restaurant was packed, so it's a good idea to make reservations.Our female server was friendly and efficient. We ordered the Prime Rib and Filet Mignon. Be advised that their version of "medium" prime rib is closer to "rare". The au jus and mashed potatoes were very tasty. They also offered sourdough bread at the beginning. Although they have some very tempting desserts, we were too full at the end of the meal to try any. Maybe next time...

What a great restaurant and bar located in the North Beach area of San Francisco. It was a pleasure to be part of the local vibe in the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Friendly servers, quick service, and a perfect venue to experience the people of San Francisco. Our dinner party was located in a private room off the main dining room. Food was excellent and served hot to each of our dinner guest (party of 30). Staff was very professional and efficient. If you are looking for a fun, active San Francisco place to eat, be sure to go to Original Joe's!!!

i was in san fran on business and the large group elected to eat at Joe's Original. The place has a very old school feel from the tiled floors to the red leather banquettes to sit in. The menu was classically Italian although I had a delicious hangar steak. the portions were generous and the service was attentive. Can't say if its just for tourists but this Italian thoroughly enjoyed his experience there.

I asked a guy on the street in Little Italy where I could get great Spaghetti and Meat Balls, nothing too expensive but, great taste. He said to " go to this place around the corner in the alley called Original Joe's, sit at the bar and ask for a half order of ravioli." You won't be disappointed. Well, I didn't want ravioli, and I wasn't disappointed! This is no alley spot!

This is a great place where plenty of locals go. You can book a table in the restaurant (booking recommended as very popular) or you can eat from the full menu anywhere in the bar if you can find a seat. It's a typical American bar with lots of stools at the bar, other comfy seating with several TV Screens usually showing sport. The first time we visited we had cocktails and a meal. We found a seat in the bar and were approached promptly and offered drinks and a menu. The service was excellent, the waitress offering to explain anything we wanted to know about on the menu and the food came relatively quickly and was to a very high standard. If you want somewhere quiet and romantic then this probably isn't the place, but if you want a good lively atmosphere coupled with great serve and food then I would highly recommend this. We also visited for pre dinner drinks another night and an afternoon drink on our last day before flying home and on all occasions were served politely and promptly. Great place, highly recommend it.

We stopped in at around 9 pm on a Sunday evening after a long day of walking checking out the sites of the city. We were warmly welcomed and promptly seated. As you might expect restaurant was not very busy. That was just fine for us. Our waitress greeted us shortly after being seated and was very nice. Water was brought promptly and our orders taken as well.We tried a Gnocchi special that was very delicious. Waitress had the chef prepare it as an appetizer portion. The wife ordered a house salad and I ordered the wedge. My wedge was a generous size. Almost to big. It could have been easily shared. The wife enjoyed her salad as well as was also a generous portion. With that being said we "shared" an entree which was a Risotto special. It was quite delicious as well. Not your typical "touristy" restaurant. It was good and we were treated well. We would go back and recommend them.

We dined here before heading over to see Beach Blanket Babylon. We were able to be seated immediately. It was a very energetic and fun vibe throughout the restaurant! We each had the crab cake appetizer and it was only fair. Not the best crab cake I have ever had. Not much taste to it surprisingly. Then the spaghetti and meatballs came out. Absolutely amazing. It was so good we couldn't stop eating nor did we want to. The service was exceptional! Went over to the bar area for cocktails after finishing dinner and it was just as much fun over there. Loads of people. Great outdoor seating area. A fun place to try for sure!

Authentic Italian. Our family of 4 thoroughly enjoyed everything we had here. I had the chicken marsala, which was excellent. Others had the linguine with clam sauce and the chicken parm. No complaints, everyone loved their meals. Only problem was we hurt ourselves eating too much! My wife and I split the out-of-this-world warm butter cake for dessert, and my daughters split the equally good warm chocolate cake... This place did everything right, including excellent service. Our favorite meal in San Francisco

We decided to eat dinner at Joe's because it was well reviewed. We, a family of 5, were not that impressed. Ok, we arrived just in time for last orders but the food was not that good on the whole. My calfs liver was cut far to thick, making it overlooked at the thin end and raw in the middle at the thick end. My wife's gnocchi (a special) weren't brilliant nor was my son's spaghetti with meat sauce. My other son's swordfish (another special) was good. My daughter's ravioli was fine. A bright spot was the house Sangiovese which was well priced and delicious. Service was also excellent and friendly apart from being very unhelpful when we asked them to order us a cab. Would not recommend this restaurant - there must be better in Little Italy.

This restaurant was suggested to us by a local and I must say, it was a casual, relaxing meal, in a place I hope to visit again. The restaurant is large and it is loud, so be prepared for potentially difficult table conversation. But, it is not an intimate restaurant, it is a fun, fast paced restaurant with absolutely tremendous service,,,,,our server was Rafael and he was excellent.The wine menu was terrific, the lasagna was terrific and the bread was terrific too. We were greeted by a friendly host, named Austin, I believe and it remained excellent the entire night.You can't go wrong at Original Joe's.

Our most recent visit was for dinner over July 4th weekend. Knowing it would be slammed made a reservation far in advance. Glad we did because the place was packed.

This is a noisy, bustling family owned Italian restaurant located in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco.Arrived a few minutes early for a 7:30 pm reservation and was seated immediately.Knew the portions were big from previous reviews so did not order any appetizers but could not resist the delicious fresh sourdough bread and butter. Ordered a bottle of wine which seemed very reasonably priced compared to our home town prices (Milwaukee).Chicken Parm and Lasagna just like you would expect, side dish options included with dinner are mashed potatoes, spaghetti or vegetables. Food served hot and very tasty. For dessert shared warm chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. Still in a food coma, hoping to be up and around by the weekend.Highlight of meal was friendly and personable service from our waiter, David. A real pro, and quite frankly the best server we have had in quite some time.

We were recommended this restaurant by fellow New Zealanders well before our trip, so we made a booking before we even arrived in the US to make sure we didn't miss out.We loved the atmosphere and the decor and we were seated in a booth which was perfect for the 5 of us. The drinks were really well done, a nice choice of cocktails and wine. The food was lovely and plentiful, and we all enjoyed everything we had ordered.The staff were gracious and attentive and made for an enjoyable and memorable evening for one of our San Francisco nights.The only negative event of the night was when I absentmindedly touched the underside of our table and felt something odd. My son used the flash on his phone to look and it turned out to be quite a few wads of used chewing gum some inconsiderate diner had stuck under there. Not the best discovery.If we happen to return to the city we would definitely return.

We reserved for Saturday evening, when we arrived we were immediately shown to a good table in a booth.The place has a buzz about it, lots of family dining and groups of people there. It made for a good atmosphere. Our server Heather was very personable, good and efficient if a little run off her feet. The food. For starters we had what turned out to be an enormous garlic bread to share as well as a mozzarella, tomato and basil salad. The salad was ordinary; dried basil that was crisp, tasteless tomatoes. For main course we had two specials and the Original Joe's Special Burger. The seafood risotto was enjoyable. The halibut was dry and considerably overdone. Original Joe's Special Burger was two large burgers ( I.e. Two large patties in two enormous sandwiches) with chips. No lettuce, tomato, garnish, sauce or anything to make it "Special". For dessert we had ice cream which was fine. The wine: we had a carafe of the Pinot noir which to the untrained palate was lovely. Overall this is a fun place to come with a bit of atmosphere. The service was very good. Unfortunately too much of the food is average at best. Our bill for three was $190 including the wine and tip.

It had been a couple of years since we have been back at this Joe's but we visited the Westlake restaurant more recently. I find the food at this place is so much better and the staff is nicer. It was interesting back when it was in the seedy Tenderloin where you had to navigate pass the drunks and homeless to get there. This place has a lot more tourists as well as some locals. It has become my go to Italian restaurant in North Beach because I like the food here and it tastes better. BFF and I tried the eggplant Parmesan. It arrived as a large square piece, reminded me of lasagna. It was really good and I liked the marinara sauce. We both had to take some of it home. We did start with a platter of fried calamari. One the the few places that makes it with the crunchy flour breading and served with a tomato and tartar dipping sauces. Hubby had the chicken piccata and a said it was just OK. I thought the breasts were over cooked as it was dry. BFFs hubby had the veal Parmesan which looked fantastic. We finished off with their butter cake, get this if it is available as they tend to run out. It was so good. We had the chocolate sauce on the side. The cake was better without the sauce.

Definitely NOT at all like the "original" Original Joes. Caprese salad was chunks of heirloom tomatoes and although the burrata mozzarella was perfect, the salad was only dressed with basil OIL, no pesto or fresh basil. When I asked for balsamic, I was given what must have been a Safeway brand of the imitation sort. The chicken Marsala that I ordered was overdone, dry, flavorless, watery, and very tough. I returned it after a couple of bites and went without.

Superbly cooked and the first restaurant I have been to in ages where I dont have to add salt straight away! Good one!Tiramisu and the choc butter pudding...sheesh! Lovely.Thoroughly enjoyed and very recommended.My only criticism is an americanism and not a restaurant specific, which is that restaurants remove plates as soon as finished which always seems to me to be a bit premature....in Scotland, we wait till everyone is finished before removing table plates...but hey, different cultures.If in San Fran, please do take a visit to Original Joes....loved it!

My family and I ate dinner here while on our vacation in San Francisco. We booked the table on OpenTable which was convenient. We arrived to find a restaurant that was in full swing -- the place was packed, the noise level deafening, and the waitstaff scurrying around like crazy! The decor was reminiscent of an old Art Deco restaurant of the 30's ... maybe it hasn't changed since they opened? Our waiter was quite friendly and when I commented on how he was running around like a mad man he looked up his Fitbit to show that he'd already walked 7,500 paces in the first 1 1/2 hours of his shift! We all settled on classic Italian pasta dishes. The only thing keeping me from rating this place Excellent was the poor fettuccini alfredo that my son had -- the sauce was quite drippy and the pasta was way over cooked.

We've had people telling us for 2 years to go eat at Original Joe's. Everyone says it wonderful. We finally got around to it last weekend and were frankly unimpressed, thinking, "Is this the place everyone raves about?". We tried the Calamari, the Minestrone, the Ravioli, and Joe's Famous Hamburger. The Calamari was OK, but cold by the time we got it, the Minestrone was actually the highlight at very good, and the Ravioli was, as my companion commented, "Just ravioli". I was the one with the hamburger and that was pretty grim. A dry patty - no lettuce, no tomato, no pickle, no condiments - on a rock-hard baguette. If I hadn't gotten some ketchup on it (came with the fries) I might not have been able to get it down. Also, a few service nits: First, it was very slow - to the point that we almost left before someone finally acknowledged us (and it was just after opening, so no crowd). Second, my wine was brought in an obviously dirty glass that also smelled of dirty washcloth. The server was nice about it, though, and quickly brought me a fresh serving in a clean glass. Third, we waited so long for our check after finishing that we thought maybe our server had left. It's a nice place in a good location, but the food just didn't cut it. We decided there's no reason to go back.

Wow. I reserved a table for four based upon a guide book suggestion that we eat here. So glad we did. We arrived at 9pm, following a tour of Alcatraz. We were seated right away and started talking with our waitress about what to order. A woman was walking by, and our waitress told us to ask her -- the owner! She stopped and talked us through the entire menu. While we were talking, the chef came by and we were introduced to him.He came by later and said he wanted to make us a special dish -- which he did. Amazing. We each ordered quite differently and all agreed that the food was amazing. Just a one of a kind dining experience. Couldn't be happier with our choice.

Original Joe's is a San Francisco institution - it's been in operation in some form since 1937 - eighty years you have to be doing something right. Fire destroyed Original Joe's and there was some fear that it might disappear, but the Grandchildem of the founder rebuilt in North Beach. It's a big sprawling place with endless red leather booths, substantial. It can get crowded. But the food to an old afficianado is if anything better. Joe's has the rep of an Italian restaurant and it lives up to that side, pasta, sauces seafood. But it also is a very good chop and steakhouse. As a light eater, I enjoy sliced tenderloin with sauce. The pastas are very good, properly cooked al dente, dressed well. As a diabetic, an Italian restaurant is a carb trap, but not so at Joe's with the steak side. I sample pasta dishes from friends or wife.  Deserts are first rate. We're San Francisco regulars for many years. Joe's left the list and returned better than ever. 

Soooooo good

 If you only have time for one dinner in SF, make it Original Joe's. You can't go wrong on this menu. Seriously. Everything is amazing. We had the privilege of meeting the owner, Marie, as she made her rounds in the dining room -- what a gem! And the head chef sent out gnocchi pesto and buratta cheese before our meal so we could try it out. If gnocchi is on the menu, get it. They make it in house. Amazing. Do not pass this place up.

Absolutely Amazing

Absolutely the best eggplant Parmesan I've ever had my life! Serving as big enough for two and perfectly prepared. Side order of meatballs pushed over the edge. Topped off with the gelato - Highly recommend this place.

Don't overlook this place!

Being a native San Franciscan, I'm always looking for new places to try and often overlook the restaurants that have been around for a long time because they're "tired" or "touristy". I did that with Original Joe's until we were in the neighborhood for an appointment and decided to give it a shot -- and am I glad we did! The ambience was classic, the portions were generous, and the food was delicious! I had the liver & onions, and it was amazing. Sure there were tourists, but there were also lots of locals. In fact, if there's one small downside to this place, it's that I felt like our server was more attentive to tourists or regulars and didn't pay too much attention to us because we were new faces or didn't need a translation of the menu. Still, it's a great option for an area like North Beach where bad, tourist traps are on every corner!

I used to patronize this establishment when I lived in San Francisco Bay Area, oh, 30+ years ago. This was my go-to place for a great meal. I just had to go back on a recent trip back to San Francisco and though it's in a new location, it did bring back great memories. Though my favorite waiters, Gino and Mario are gone, the service is still great. Just love this place...and the garlic bread!!!

Maria and her staff provide the best American Italian food West of NYC - the venue is superb and always busy so book ahead of leave yourself time. We sat at the chefs bar and had a fantastic lasagna and spaghetti carbonara whilst watching the energy of the kitchen staff. The experience was so good we've booked again and will keep coming back every time we're in San Fran in future. They even have matchbooks to accompany th red leather booths and fantastic wine choices.

Really nice feel when you enter. Large booth seating. Waiters dressed in tuxedos which is a nice touch. All wait staff are very attentive, topping up drinks regularly and checking up on meals to ensure everything is ok. Great food, we ordered the lasagne, spaghetti & meatballs & the chicken parmigiana which were all really nice. Would definitely visit again! 

Great atmosphere, one poor main course choice

Worth a visit but don't choose the Fried Prawn main course option. Mine seemed more 'KFC' than Italian cuisine. They were 'breaded' and over cooked - made them rather tasteless and chewy.My 3 table mates were all happy with their choices and given a great buzz I would suggest you should visit but don't try the prawns. 

Sensational! Excellent food and ambient!

Great place to eat and drink if you are visiting San Francisco! I got the lasagna, tasted Cesar salad (huge) and the parmegiana chicken (even bigger)!! Fair price considering the size of the food (you can share easily some of the choices)! You should certainly try!

Went here for Sunday brunch and asked for a flat white that you would get in Australia, they googled it and the coffee was great! It's rare that restaurants go that extra step to satisfy customers these days. The food was very good and service was excellent. We sat out the front but if you want an old style cafe booth ask to be sat out the back, they looked really comfy. Reasonably priced, well worth a visit.

Ignored by Bartenders

I stopped in Original Joe's with two friends for some cocktails before heading out to dinner. It was early so the place was pretty empty. We took three seats at the bar but our bartender was too busy talking to a friend of his who was also sitting at the bar. He basically gabbed with him the whole time about sports, friends, etc. and ignored the only three other people he had to wait on. Eventually I interrupted him and requested some drinks. He got them for us but then never inquired with us about a refill. So we paid and left and won't go back.

This is as much fun as the Waiters' Gallop in Hello, Dolly! From the afternoon until 9:30pm when we were seated, they fed 600 people. Amazing. Easy parking on street or lot, UBER/LYFT/MUNI/Taxi or walk/bike. Nice room, but earsplitting loud. Pro tip: go late. Have drinks at home/hotel/elsewhere/or at the bar, then dine late. Its very relaxing and they do NOT rush you out. Service amazing, kind, fast, informed. Food: delicous! Foodies will submit to it, and regular eaters will be very happy. Good for all palettes. Pricey but not foo-foo, so your more basic types can enjoy themselves too. Try the Barolo. Expensive at $18/glass but delish. GLUTEN FREE SAFE!!! They will help you navigate the menu. Very aware/careful and protect their patrons. They have a great private room for a midsized group. Noisy but you barely hear them in there. Bar has TV for sports. Booths are comfy and nostalgic. Located in fabulous North Beach/Italian area right on Washington Square park across from the picturesque Saints Peter & Paul Church. Perfect location! GREAT photo ops w/church but also outside in front of the vintage Original Joe's sign. Memorable. Great wines, cocktails, starters, entrees, salads, desserts.Restrooms very nice/clean. Entire place run so professionally. Easy going atmosphere but they are dead serious about you having a safe, clean, delicious meal and enjoyable visit. Great for dates, families, tourists, locals, friends, business.

Guys night for dinner last week with very good Italian food and steak. I had the wedge salad and prime rib sandwich and both were excellent. We had a really great evening, staff were great and accommodating. Excellent food and service. A bit noisy. Looks like there are several nice private rooms for private parties.

Just off Columbus Avenue along restaurant "row", this lovely location serves nicely prepared seafood and beef. Portions are plentiful and the service is attentive without being intrusive. The sole entree was delicious and a side of creamed spinach rounded off the meal. Does not an extensive beer selection and that was disappointing.

Step back in time - in a good way!

The food portions were huge. My 12 yr old who has a huge appetite ordered the burger, then my 9 yr old who can hold his own ordered the burger. The server paled - literally paled and said "I don't think this is a good idea, they should share" - which was music to my ears as I don't like ordering meals and then having a lot of leftovers. One burger two starving kids... they could not finish the burger. So us parents tried, we did not finish the burger. Like I said, serving portions were huge. I ordered the wedge salad - didn't finish it. We also ordered a chicken piccata, didn't finish that. Everything we tried was delicious, the true definition of comfort food - the ambiance was fun - I kept expecting Frank and Dean and the rest of the rat pack to show up - maybe I'm a few decades late - but this was well worth the visit during our limited time in the city.

Lovely Italian restaurant with beautiful decor and ample seating. Great antipasto platter but the sea bass was overdone and the veggies that came with were also over cooked. They made up for it with a good tiramisu. Service was extremely slow but we were not in a rush.

It is always nice to come back to Original Joe's. The food is delicious and the portions are large. We have eaten both the entree salads and the hamburger sandwich and it is really good. The service is very professional and somehow they manage to keep an eye on every table all the time - you never wait for more bread or water.They offer valet parking which is nice as it can be difficult to park in the area.We will be back next time we come to San Francisco.

We had dinner here on a Saturday night, and when we walked in early for our 8:30 dinner reservation the place was mobbed. They were two deep at the bar, with every seat taken with people waiting for tables. I questioned to myself whether or not we would be seated at our reservation time, but, sure enough, we were seated on time. We shared their sole picatta, eggplant parmagiana, and side of pasta with pesto sauce. I thought I had died and went to heaven when I ate their eggplant. It was absolutely delicious. I come from a Sicilian family, where my grandmother was the best cook of everyone, and this was as good as hers. We ate every bite. The sole and the pesto pasta was also delicious, but the eggplant topped everything. Prices were reasonable, Grazie! Molto bene!

Amazing food, great service.

Wonderful Italian, charming place. 4 of us went and all had a great dinner with top notch service, a bit on the expensive side but if you are out for a treat, well worth it. I liked it so much I went to another location the next day and had the same good experience there, on my way to the airport. Highly recommomend if you like Italian. And the history is interesting too.

Picked this spot from Trip Advisor. Nice bar, cocktail and lounge area with a fireplace, all very separate from the dining area. Very nice dining atmosphere, very wooden. Mine was simple, spaghetti and meatballs. Meatballs tender and moist, not rock hard like most restaurant meatballs. The dish was very good. My wife had spaghetti with meat sauce. Likewise a good dish. Sitting by the open kitchen we saw many of the menus items come out, which judging by looks, were probably really good. I would recommend this place. Thanks you Joe's.

Well what can I say except Amazing food. I was on holiday to visit family and told we just couldn't leave before eating here. Seriously good quality food, 6 of us ate here and there was very little talk because we were busy enjoying the flavours. From different cut steaks to lasagne, side orders and sauces. It was that good I made a 2nd visit before we left the city and it was fabulous again, if you are in San Francisco then pls go there, highly recommended. I nt wait to go again in meat future

I came here with my sister and brother-in-law for an early dinner. They are locals and foodies, so I knew that I was in for a treat. Great Italian food, service and ambience. Classic San Francisco restaurant in North Beach. Highly recommend.
