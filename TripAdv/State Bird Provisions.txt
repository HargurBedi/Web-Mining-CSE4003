We showed up for the second time in a year without a reservation. Although there was no room left, we did manage to get in a little later on that evening by waiting around next door. So thankful it worked out. The dim sum type dishes that they take around to the tables are amazing and the Oysters are one of my favourite choices. You can also order off the menu to supplement the people coming around with the bites. Whatever you order, you will NOT be disappointed. I didn't know that they had a michelin star but it makes perfect sense. The unique flavour combinations coupled with the quality of the food is incredible. Also, the service is truly outstanding, you feel taken care of at all times. I recommend doing your best to get here for a meal if you are in San Francisco.

We stumbled upon this restaurant on a Saturday evening. Luckily, they had a "no show" and we were in with less than a five minute wait! What a fun night! The staff was friendly, the service was amazing, the dim sum style with tasty morsels was unique and fun! We shared an entree from the menu and sampled a huge variety of "provisions." Go if you can! I highly recommend it. 

Superb food but complicated concept

This is a Michelin starred restaurant and deservedly so for its food. The menu is simple enough with sharing plates and bigger main courses combining the most diverse ingredients to create ambrosia. The complex bit is the selection of specials brought around like a dim sum trolley or a Brazilian churrascaria. The difference is, they don't tell you how many different dishes are available and what they are- a culinary Russian roulette. How many do you pre order? Don't go too soon on the dishes that come round as you may miss a better one!! At the very least, they could solve this by sticking them on a blackboard to allow you to make an informed choice.Great , great restaurant, the nicest staff , but get rid of the mystique and think of the customer!!

A great concept, superbly executed

You order small plates either from the menu or you can also choose from 'trolleys' that come to your table. Everything is beautifully prepared and it's a great way to sample things you might not have been prepared to risk as a single choice from a menu - or for those who have trouble choosing and/or like to share with others!Service was friendly and efficient, and there is a wide selection of beers & wines too.

Bring a book or someone who will save your spot because the best way to gain entrance without a reservation (usually not readily available anyway) is to get on the line outside the unassuming restaurant (easy to miss... except for the line) an hour before they open. A large portion of seats will be given out at opening time to people who are waiting to get in. We've done it twice and had no problem getting a table (2-4 people seem to be easily seated this way).Once in, enjoy a constant parade of tapas style dishes offered to you and carefully described by your friendly servers... enough to share or have a forkful depending on the dish.Dishes vary from interesting salad combinations to vegetable and meat dishes... save room for the "state bird."NOTE: It's very crowded, but no sense of being rushed, and don't fill up on the first round of dishes... there's lots of variety to choose from and you can request dishes as well. Fun and delicious eating experience.

Pretty disappointing

For a Michelin starred restaurant, I expected more. I think the concept of a dim sum-style American restaurant is interesting, but the execution was lacking during my visit. There was nothing memorable about the food, except that it all came in waves, meaning that if you came at the wrong time, you could be waiting quite a while for even one dish to be brought around the tables. As for the price, it was actually relatively inexpensive...we tried virtually all the dishes, and had one drink each, and the bill for three was less than $200 with tip and tax. Because this restaurant changes its menu daily, I am willing to try this place again and will hope for a better outcome.

What a unique experience! This is unlike any restaurant I'd ever been to before. Definitely want to make a reservation for this venue. They have a menu from which to order, but in addition there are travelling food carts, each with a different item that you my choose or not. Clearly marked with name of dish & price. It's like making a meal out of a variety of delicious appetizers. Everything we tried was MARVELOUS. Service was quick and efficient. Casual atmosphere. Definitely will make a return trip next time we're in town! 

Okay, but not great.

Their take on some traditional items served dim sum style. The food was good--not great--and the experience was fun--at the start. After a couple of items, the service began to seem impersonal and machine-like. Robotic. Still, the food was good. Near then of the meal, we got the impression that they thought we were done and were ready for the next group. They basically shut down our table--and, so, we stopped eating when we were still ready for more. Understand that we weren't just lingering at the table after the meal. The service, itself, just more or less ground to a halt. So, given that they seemed to think we were done--after we got someone's attention and made a final order--we left. Not the most pleasant of experiences.

I have been hearing for years how great this restaurant was, but reservations are nearly impossible to get. They leave a third of the restaurant available each night for walk-ins. I got in line around 4:45 and was able to secure a 7pm reservation when the doors opened at 5:30. Rarely do places live up to the hype, but i am hear to tell you that State Bird Provisions is the real deal. Service, food, and atmosphere were 2nd to none. One of the all time greats!

I made reservations well in advance, and suggest you do as well) and was lucky enough to score a seat at the "Chef's bar" , best seat in the house!! Everything was top notch, food, service, vibe, beer. It's a dim sum/small plate/ tapas style menu so pace yourself and order as many plates as you can handle. If you sit at the bar, just let the chefs do your ordering. One of my favorite restaurants ever!!

I had no idea what to expect even though I had looked up the menu before heading over. I was blown away!We were seated almost right away ( definitely make a reservation before you go as they are always busy) and started with a bottle of wine!My favourite part of the experience was how freshly prepared food on trays kept arriving at the table ( with a price tag each time) and all you had to do was say yes or Yes!! Most times we said yes!! We tried a range of foods and there is definitely something for everyone!Great experience and looking forward to the next time!

We dined at State Bird Provisions this week for the first time with a reservation at 530 opening and requested to be seated at the Chef's table. The experience was one of the most fun, entertaining and tasty meals I've ever had. If you have a reservation don't be worried about the line of people waiting at the front door. You will be called forward to get your seat as soon as the doors open. For first time diners try to be seated at the chefs table which is the counter at the front of the restaurant where all the food is prepared. This way you can get every dish as it is first prepared and don't have to wait until they are circulated through the restaurant by the service staff. You can also talk to the chefs and find out what's in each dish. I think "tasting menu" is the best way to describe the dining experience. We sampled 14 small plates plus a half order of state bird from the menu. Other than state bird which is the signature dish it's not necessary to order from the menu since there's a wide variety of other dishes to choose from coming out of the kitchen. You can also order half orders of three different deserts so you get to sample more than one. We had a total of 14 dishes and which was plenty of food for two. The total bill for food and one glass of wine came to $120 which I felt was a real bargain for food quality, quantity and variety of novel dishes. The service was excellent at the chefs table. We always had several servers hovering about to help us choose dishes. The atmosphere is high energy so pace yourself and enjoy this novel dining experience.

i don't really want more people coming here as theres always a huge line waiting from 5pm every day. Hard to get reservations but incredibly great service with great food. The Yum cha idea with non chinese foods is great and they have it down to a fine art with timing. You can order from the menu or from the various trays of food that are brought around showing the price of each as well. Our waitress was amazing like all the food items served. The quail was the best I have ever had and I have dined at over 100 michelin stared restaurants in the last 3 years and for only one star this is the best yet. The lines after 5 years are a symbol of response to a restaurant doing everything right.

Small plates, ranging from very good to phenomenal. We had their set menu (sampling of all 17 dishes available that night!) at 1 of 2 Alcove tables, for our party of 6.Must haves that we had include: daikon fries; almond biscuits with duck liver mousse; pork belly; summer squash goat cheese toast; shrimp and heart of palm salad; fried Guinea hen; zucchini walnut cake. Menu changes frequently so you'll get something we wish we had. Excellent wine list but it's pricey.Reservations are necessary. Book them at least 30 days in advance.

If one is not that sophisticated, or aware of how Dim Sum restaurants work, the experience can be a bit daunting.Tray by tray, different dishes are brought to the table and described (and price given) and then you can opt to take a serving (or more) or pass it up and wait for the next tray of offerings. I believe there are usually about 12-15 different dishes on offer on any night, though I stopped counting after a while ! The problem I had was that I did not know whether to fill up on the earlier offerings in case something more delicious was still coming and if you turn down a dish or eat it and want more, there is no guarantee there will be any left ! Nevertheless, the food was generally very tasty and beautifully prepared. There is also a limited menu that one can order from instead of taking from the surprises on the trays and dessert is from the menu.All in all, a wonderful, if expensive, experience.

We really enjoyed the concept of State Bird...you order some things on the menu but there real challenge is the carts (like dim sum) that come around which are dishes designed at the whim of the chef...they are wonderfully original and delicious and made the dinner a great experience. everything is for your table to share; the servers were very helpful and the timing of courses both ordered off the menu and the carts were also great. we did not like the music, mostly drumbeats, in the background...they distracted from the experience of enjoying the food and each other's company.

What better way to celebrate a Golden 50th Wedding Anniversary but in the Golden State with its State Bird the Quail at hip/contemporary State Bird Provisions!Eight of us to include the golden couple, on a Hawaii-like, stellar, glittery evening set out from Berkeley crossing the Bay Bridge. We were treated with spectacular views of the Golden Gate with a radiant sunset-lit sky and shimmering bay waters!Waiting for our 8:30PM table, we enjoyed some cocktails at the symbiotic next door establishment The Progress. The 17-course bite size, small plate style fare was detailed on a personalized 50th Anniversary menu. After 2.5 hours of seemingly non-stop varying flavor bursts paired with terrific wines, our gullets were more than satiated!Each presentation offered an assortment of very unique ingredients, cooked to perfection, while adding the elements of anticipation/surprise to the non-ritualistic dining experience. Our servers seamlessly executed the exchange of plates, pouring of water/wine while providing alternative dishes for those with dietary restrictions. The commemorative Golden Anniversary dessert concluded the evening with very rich textures.Ooh, it makes me wonder, after 50 years, can one top this Golden Event?

This review specifically addresses some of the gripes from negative reviewers.One kind of negative review focuses on the walk-in experience. Here's my recommendation... When you're trying for a walk-in table, think about your backup plan. If there are no tables available for a few hours, will you prefer to wait? What will you do while waiting? Or would you rather go somewhere else and try some other evening? In a city with so many dining options that is home to both Uber and Lyft, you'll surely be able to figure something out. Over three different walk-in attempts at different times of the year, I was able to get a table twice and had a very enjoyable experience at another restaurant once.The second kind of negative comment has to do with the food. You'll get to taste so many dishes, you're sure to find something that you really like. To the extent that you're not 100% pleased with every dish, remember that you're part of an experimental process. It's important for a restaurant like State Bird Provisions to challenge themselves and their customers so that they can continue to evolve.Keep your schedule flexible, your mind open, smile at the wait staff, cheer for the cooks, share, and enjoy!

First timer to State Bird Provisions so we asked the waiter for suggestions and he was spot on! Should make reservations way in advance as there was a long waiting line when we arrived for our reservation and restaurant staff was telling those in long that there is no guarantee that they will get in tonight - the place was packed at 5:30 pm on a Wednesday night. As noted by others, there are some items on the menu and the rest are dim sum style carts that change. We ordered the California State Bird Provisions (tasty and crunchy coating and we loved the reduced onions), carrot mochi w/brown butter and pistachio dukkah (we loved the flavored mochi and the texture contrast with the carrots) and of course the ice cream sandwich w/cherries off the menu. Cart items included pork belly w/citrus salad, poke or raw meat w/mushrooms and veggie chips, pork ribs, and fish tail w/ some kind of Asian sauce. Each dish was a yummy surprise to the taste buds. If only we had our own personal chef that could cook like this; must come back to try some of the other dishes.

Creative and inventive food that mostly works

My daughter and son-in-law, who live in San Francisco got us a booking at this inventive, reasonably new, and very popular San Francisco restaurant. State Bird Provisions works somewhat like a yumcha restaurant, but it is very different. Each night the kitchen prepares 12 different dishes and servers come with rolling tables and the price of the item offered. Diners may take one, two (or more) servings or decline. Diners may also order a limited number of other offerings off the menu.We found almost all of the dishes were both creative and inventive. For the most part, they were also delicious. On our recent visit, we did feel that kimchi sauce was over-used. Thus, for example, an excellent lamb with a crispy crust and a beautiful tender inside was hurt--rather than helped--by the kimchi sauce. In other cases, the kimchi sauce added rather than subtracted. (I make these comments as the husband of a Korean-born wife!) We also enjoyed a fava bean toast that was beautifully colored with flowers and very tasty as well. Other excellent dishes were grilled octopus and sunchokes (aka Jerusalem artichokes) with a tahini aioli. Other fine dishes included beets (beetroot) and a halibut tartare.The desserts, except for the ricotta cake (which was a "nothing" dish), were all interesting and tasty including an ice cream sandwich, a "bao" with blueberries and almonds and a ginger-ale granita with tapioca.The service was excellent and friendly. My daughter and son-in-law, both in the food industry, said the hallmark of the serving was teamwork.State Bird Provisions is not an inexpensive night out, but it is very appropriate for that special celebration dinner. With some alcohol and relatively hungry appetites, we spent a bit over $100 per person including tip.Demand for reservations is very high, so I recommend trying to get a reservation for that special night as soon as possible. Reservations open 60 days before, so some planning will be required. However, if you like food that is different, creative and tasty, State Bird Provisions is an excellent choice (though I still do not understand the restaurant's name!)

Food is a 10- unique and creative. The atmosphere is super casual and the ambience is noisy and bustling. The fun thing they do is bring around carts of food for you to eat so you might want to wait to see what is offered on the carts before ordering off the menu. The food comes rapid fire and the wine list is great. Creative food, nothing classic so if you are a picky eater or are just looking for a steak or burger this is not for you.

I booked our table the day the reservations opened, for an anniversary dinner on a trip to San Francisco. I had been looking forward to this my whole trip. But. I felt that it must have been over hyped. I've eaten at Michelin stared restaurants around the world, but this was just missed the mark for me. The service was casual and so the style of the restaurant. But it did feel pressured to sell. The duck 'fried rice' dish from the menu was great, as were many others, but there was just no single dish that wowed us, and that is the issue. For the hype, I expected to have a few dishes to remember and many I wanted to grab my camera to capture. But it turns out, I don't have a single photo :(

I travel to San Francisco about once a year, and I finally got a chance to try State Bird Provisions after being aware of it for more than a year. I have to say that I really like every aspect of it - the dining concept, the food and the service. It deserves all the accolades it gets.For my visit, I had:Hog island oysters withpickled daikon and chili oil - good starterSmoked duck with vinaigrette - yumFried chicken with kimchi custard - it was okSpanish octopus with vinaigrette - deliciousDuck confit and wagon wheel cheese croquette - deliciousOx tail with peanut pozole - it was okchai tea ice cream sandwich - deliciousblood orange granita with olive oil gelee - did not like thisAlthough I did not absolutely love every dish I ordered, what I do love here is the "dim sum" concept of ordering - the servers bring out little dishes with a little price tag on the tray, and you get to see whether it looks good to you or not. Once you pick something, the server marks it on your sheet. There is also the option of ordering from the menu as well, but the dim sum style is just way more fun, and you also get to try dishes that are not on the menu. I was excited to know when ordering desserts that half-orders are accepted - so being the greedy hungry person that I am, I ordered two half-order desserts - the chai tea ice cream sandwich and the granita. When I was asked about how dessert was, I informed my server that I did not love the granita (and it was not even half finished). He kindly took that off the bill without any intervention on my part, and I was very impressed with the service.Needless to say, I will be visitng SBP again for my next SF visit. Reservations are a must because the place does get packed. As for myself, I managed to do a walk-in for just one person at around 6pm and sat at the chef's counter without having to wait.

When 2 chefs from your hometown (Atlanta) tell you to go here, you don't question it. You hope & pray you can get a reservation & gladly fork over a credit card to hold it. You go, order 11 dishes, & enjoy every last delicious morsel. You then post an obligatory collage on Instagram & give the aforementioned chefs a shout out on their excellent recommendation. The meal was a little too fast-paced for my liking, however, this was probably our fault because we kept accepting dishes right when they were presented instead of letting them make a few rounds first. We were literally offered the first dish within 2 minutes of sitting down. The food was tasty, the trout (rotating dish), state bird (menu), & smoked salmon/avocado dip (rotating) were definitely the highlights & the service was EXCELLENT - super friendly staff! Casual, laid-back, hipster vibe made for a relaxing meal. We also had a table next to the open kitchen which made for an excellent view & lots of fun watching new dishes come out. Note, they have beer & wine but no cocktails (but our server suggested I could go right next door & grab something if I so wished). Also, for those visiting San Fran, the street the restaurant is located on has tons of great shopping a few blocks up & is a great way to kill time before your reservation. Two thumbs up for State Bird!

This is an unusual experience, because it is "American dim-sum". About half the choices are on the menu, but the other half circulates through the room on trays or carts and you just pick what strikes your fancy. The room is modest but the staff is among the very best in the city and the food is inventive and excellent (I'll call it modern American, baroque and eclectic). We were there on a night where the place was inordinately busy (even by its lofty standard, which is t say something) because of a very large business conference close by. The front desk host juggled a never-ending deluge of guests for multiple hours with a smile on his face, a pleasant word for everybody and unparalleled efficiency. The best in the business, globally, bar none. The wait staff and the food matched his level of professionalism and humor. And guests get into the convivial mood. What a fantastic restaurant. Go there if you can get in, bring your appetite and your sense of humor and you will have a great time.

I'd been majorly let down by Yelp and Tripadvisor hype for another San Fran restaurant the night before, so I tried not to get by hopes up about State Bird Provisions. I loved the decor and atmosphere. It was quirky without trying too hard, not overtly hipster, and marched to the beat of its own drum. I thought the dim sum trays and carts would be gimicky, but they weren't. The dishes were timed well, and the carts and trays were purely functional--not spectacle. There were definitely a few misses, a sea urchin kimchi something or other comes to mind, but we can probably rule that down to being acquired tastes. Everything else we ordered was excellent, the biggest standout being the carrot mochi. I am definitely coming back on my next visit to the Bay Area.

 Went to State Bird on a Saturday night, party of 3. Enjoyed the quail from menu and all else from offerings by staff. Had delicious pork belly, adequate oyster, great beet dish and fantastic short ribs. The quail alone would have been worth the trip, crispy, tender and the provisions were outstanding. Ended night with rose geranium dessert. Very tasty but lacked any flower taste. Memorable evening with family.

State Bird Provisions is a classic example of a restaurant that has taken a cute idea (Western dim sum) and built up an unwarranted amount of hype for what I would consider slightly above average quality fare. I'm also concerned the restaurant is using shady practices to generate favorable buzz - if you look at the reviews on various popular sites, you will notice identical language from different reviewers and what appears to be professional reviews.We arrived at 5:30 pm looking for a table for 6. Unfortunately, the restaurant filled up, so we left our phone number and returned two hours later when space opened up. We didn't mind as we found a bar to pass the time. Given the wait, we were hungry and ready to try as many things on the menu as we could.After the first few dishes, we were satisfied that the food was pretty good, but certainly nothing special. Among our small plates, we tried a fried quail dish, uni pancakes, oysters and pork belly. Nothing stood out, and the value for food was terrible! The uni pancakes cost $7 each, and the pancakes were the size of the bottom of a coffee cup. The dollop of uni on top was maybe a third of the size of an actual piece of uni. An order of fried quail, which is half a quail, cost $15. Worst of all, the quality and creativity of the food didn't even come close to justifying the exorbitant prices. Disappointed, we stopped ordering food and left only partially full.To be clear, the food is closer to three star food, but taking into account value and the difficulty obtaining a table, the overall experience is two stars. You have been forewarned!

A few times in your life, you experience a restaurant that both surprises and delights, as well as changes your notion of what is possible. State Bird Provisions (SBP)in San Francisco, run by James Beard Award winning Chef Stuart Brioza and his wife Nicole Krasinski, is such a culinary miracle. Not content to sit on its impressive culinary laurels, which include winning Best New Restaurant in 2013, SBP continues to create edible masterpieces that are so varied and delectable. From madeleines of fois gras to juicy soup guinea hen dumplings; from its signature CA state bird w/ provisions dish to finger held and lickin pancakes with imaginative and savory accompaniments; from pork fried farro to tuna crudo; from cast iron veggies to King salmon prepared Mandarin style; from refreshing granitas to sinful ice cream sandwiches worth exercising for; these are just a few of my favorite dishes. But the food is matched by an ambiance that both envelopes and enraptures one like a Hawaiian seabreeze at dusk greeting a tourist from Chicago in January. Let me end by saying that my favorite spot is to eat standing up by the cash register, which is where they used to squeeze me in when I would beg for a spot at the last minute as I drove home after spending a day doctoring at the hospital. I have offered to buy a coveted bar stool spot in front of the open kitchen where nightly food operas are performed. To date my offers have been rebuffed. I am.hoping that this review may coax them to reconsider my offer...

I booked reservations here 2 months in advance. When we arrived we still had to stand & wait for a table. You can either wait for things to come by your table or you can order off of the menu. I actually thought the ordered food was better. For some reason some of the trays skipped our table. I was surprised that our waiter forgot to take our cocktail order when we sat down. I like the dim sum concept & the food was unique but I wasn`t blown away by most of the food.

A highlight of San Francisco's dinning scene. A mix of dishes to order and dim style carts, with a wildly inventive marriage of various cuisines. We sampled the famous state bird (fried quail), ricotta pancakes, one with and the other a kind of sour dough blini, Dungeness crab with tofu skin pappardelle, short ribs, biscuits with foie gras, oysters with kim's, pork belly infused chawamushi, octopus with a buffalo wing style sauce. Dessert was a bitter sweet chocolate rice pudding, custard with blood orange granita, and a coconut ice cream sandwich, topped off with a muscavado (a shot of a snickers like milk drink). Service was very helpful. Great food, great time.

Stopped by State Bird on a recent girls trip and couldn't have been happier. The Dim Sum style if fabulous, as is the food. What makes the place great though, is the staff. Waiters share tables and each and every one of them was so nice and knowledgeable. They made our night!

The atmosphere was great and fun. Loved the inventive way they serve the food. They bring around plate dim sum style but it's not dim sum food. The food was inventive and tasted great. The duck confit fried rice was the star of the night.

I honestly have mixed feelings about this place. Even though I admit that the food is well-elaborated, the atmosphere, especially the lighting, is not really special. I felt that I was in an average dining room, not in a place with a unique soul. The dim sum philosophy applied in this restaurant is also cool, but it can be overwhelming to a certain extent. The service was pretty decent, but again I need to highlight that it is a fast pace place that didn't make me feel comfortable; you feel a permanent rush that is absolutely not compatible with a fine dining concept. I like it casual but not extremely casual...anyway, it was alright. I was expecting more from a Michelin star restaurant.

More about the Atmosphere, than the Food
Rating: 3

I've read a couple of reviews before we headed to the restaurant. It was booked as part of a holiday celebration and high on the list for many of those who were based in SF. We were a party of 6, had some shared food allergies and vegetarian restrictions to contend with and shared with the restaurant pre-arrival.I'm aligned to those who view the experience as more about the atmosphere than the food. The place has a good vibe and I would definitely say caters to the hipster culture. One look around and you can see all those basking in the 'coolness' of the place. This is further enforced by the dress of the servers, the seating configurations and the style in which the food is served (Yum-cha style). As far as atmosphere, I give it points for hitting its mark, without a doubt.The food on the other hand, was hit and miss. Some overly salty, others perfectly balanced, some very bland, others 'trying a bit too much', some 'leaving a weird taste' others 'wow'. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the place again or recommend it to someone looking for a truly good SF culinary experience. But if someone was looking for a 'true SF hipster' experience, then it would be high on my recommendation list.One thing, I would note, it's something my husband (ex-chef) taught me to recognise - be cautious of a place where a server doesn't ask about your food (and I don't mean... 'We are all good here, right?'). This is especially telling, when they pick up a plate that has clearly had only a single bite taken out of it or worst, it looks as though a bite has been 'put back'. This was my experience here - granted it was busy and we were a large table, and the server might have just been too caught up in everything else to really take notice... but of course, I noticed.

This is a fantastic restaurant although very hard to get into. Reservations are hard to make so if you intend to go to San Fran and want to experience one of the cities coolest restaurants then book in advance. If you decide to take a chance they do take walk ins but be prepared to wait. The food is yum cha style service so small plates are prepared in multiple dishes and brought around on trays, you select what you want when they present the trays. All the dishes are amazing. The wine is exceptional and the staff are super friendly. great buzzing atmosphere. Highly recommend eating here if you are after a lively atmosphere and hipster SF experience.

One of the most memorable meals I've had in recent times. Often, when places are so hyped up, they end up being disappointing, but not this one. Flavoursome, interesting food and a fun experience with their yumcha style service concept. Excellent vegetarian options both on the printed menu and circulating around straight from the kitchen - I particularly loved the squash mochi dish which is on their "Commandables" menu. The portion sizes are very fair. It isn't a "cheap" place as such, but it is certainly one of the cheaper Michelin-starred meals you can have in the world. Bookings for plum times between 6pm and 8pm can be hard to come by - be prepared to pounce as soon as bookings open for your preferred day if you want one of those times. I will definitely be back!

We booked well in advance so we could get a favorable reservation on a Friday evening. We arrived and still waited for approx. 15 minutes which was no big deal. We were seated and were prompted served by Daniel who made an extra effort to make us comfortable with the menu, the cart approach, etc. We had two gluten free members in our party as well as a vegetarian. Daniel noted each item on the menu that were suitable for each diet. Everything we had selected were excellent to very good. Our favorites that evening were the trout, salad and mochi with brussel sprouts. Overall, the food lived up to the hype and the service was equally outstanding, thanks to Daniel.

First of all, make a reservation plenty in advance or plan to get there well before they open and wait at the door. Pretty much as soon as you sit down, the carts roll through offering small plates of fresh seasonal fare. Some of it is Asian-inspired but not all. We had everything from sea urchin tostadas to grilled octopus to soy glazed ribs. There were new plates coming through every 5 minutes. It was so great to try so many different dishes! I will definitely go out of my way to visit this place again! Bring your friends and share family style!

The concept is great and the food is very good although it is a bit fussy for the venue and trolley concept.The food comes around non-stop and each waiter tells you all the details of every dish making it hard to have a conversation. You must be ready to focus on the experience and less on your group.

Tried State Bird Provisions with my adult children on a recent visit and loved it. They reserve about one third of seating for walk ins. Folks to start lining up nearly an hour before the restaurant opens to get those seats. While in line, State Bird staff brought out trays of hot-spiced cider in glass cups. The taste sensations begin even before you enter the restaurant. At opening time, the whole staff lines up to welcome you inside. It's as if you are entering a friend's house to dine with friends. We enjoy the adventure of sampling new dishes--typically ordering and sharing tapas-style. This restaurant offered the perfect opportunity to do that. You can order specific items off the menu. Staff also comes around every about every 15 minutes to offer you one of the specials of the day created from the freshest ingredients available each day. You can accept or decline to try each item. All those we tried were delicious!

I've been wanting to come to state Bird and provisions for a while now. Finally made it and was not disappointed. Everything was good, most dishes were great. Inventive unique flavors. The staff is very friendly and fun. The style is new American small plates. Some dishes you can order off a menu. Others come around on carts, dim sum style. It's a lot of fun. Also means you can eat soon after sitting down. This is a must visit place. Can be tricky getting a reservation so plan early. But very worth it.

After reading all of the reviews i was kinda shocked. I made reservations 60 days in advance for a monday night at 7:15pm. We got there and had to wait 25 mins. Ok fine. The dining is set up in there is a small set menu then waiters come around with small plates and you get to choose. The problem is there is no set order to the dishes, so you dont know how many are left. Also, the wait time in between each dish was very long. We were in there for almost 90 mins. The food overall was good not amazing. The best thing was the cod fish cakes. Did i leave still hungry and went to get ice cream YES!

Lucky to get in, as have heard it can take months. Interesting style of serving, with carts periodically circulating with small "sample" or tapa-like dishes to purchase/try. Unique foods creatively prepared.Each tapa is around $5-$10 each. We split each between four of us. Enough for a tasting. If you'd like to order off of the menu, there are larger items on it. We certainly were not stuffed when we left, but pleasantly satisfied. Enjoyed the experience. Casual atmosphere. Fun experience. Order a bottle of wine and enjoy picking whatever suits your fancy off the carts.

They made good on my reservation made months ago (which they did not find). We waited for doors to open at 5:30pm and were happily seated at the bar so that we could watch the food prep and choose plates right away. Amazing food: Tasty, innovative, satisfying. Small portion "tapas" style presented "dim sum" style with so many dishes to choose from. Also ordered off the menu. Had the ginger spice cake with cashews and white chocolate topping. Sorry, the food is so innovative that I really can't describe it. You just have to dive in and try it! Sketchy neighborhood so make sure your ride is ready to pick you up.

Small bites that you choose from trays as servers walk past. A running score is kept at your table. Lots of hits and misses here. Expect to wait 30 minutes if you have a reservation. Otherwise it will take an hour and a half to be seated. Average about $50 each before tip. It seems to be more about pretention than substance.

They call it "Dim Sum style" but really it's tapas to me in that they bring around tasty little plates of excellent fresh food around past the tables on carts. Octopuses and duck liver pate etc all so wonderful. There is a small menu to order off of bud didn't even get to it. Every plate is offered with a little price tag an a stick And I thought everything was very reasonably priced. Decor is ridiculously plain and simple - they spent nothing on creating an interior but the place buzzed because it's just so busy. Kind of like a high end diner. Don't come here for a quiet dinner for sure! Glad i didn't miss it - literally there is NO sign just a small quail on the bottom of the front window- and a ton of people.

Some of the things were absolutely superb, the sea urchin pan cake simply outstanding. A lethal combo, you will eat too much, guaranteed. Don't forget to try the peanut milk. Highly recommended!

We finally got a reservation at this popular restaurant and it was worth the wait. We ordered the state bird (quail) from the menu but mostly ate from the small plates which are passed in the style of a dim sum restaurant. Only the oysters were a disappointment - they were fine but not nearly as flavorful as everything else we tried. Highlights included the pork belly salad, smoked trout chip and dip, duck liver mousse. Some people might find the noise and minimal furnishings to be a negative, but once the food comes everything else fades away.

A restaurant which has had great reviews for a long time....and yet the reservations need to be made a month or more in advance of the date you will dine. People wait outside the restaurant for an open spot! I give credit to my friend for doing the leg work and making the reservation.....and it was worth the wait! I am a believer now!There are two styles of dining....normal entrees, or Dim Sum style small plates which are carted around the dining room for you to view and select. We chose the latter style and after 5 small plates and a glass of fabulous Spanish wine, we were full!!! Some of the choices from the "Provisions" menu -Smoked chicken wings with brown butter porcini and goat cheese fondue; duck liver mousse with almond biscuit; smoked trout avocado "chip and dip" with homemade potato chips!; roasted delicata squash with pepita mole and pomegrante; charred cabbage with meyer lemon-sesame ponzu!Menus change and always fresh ingredients! Enjoy!!!!

The food was pretty good, but after waiting a month for my reservation I was expecting to be blown away. In fact, I found it's sister restaurant, The Progress, to be better overall. It could have been because it was so late, but not much was being passed around but there wasn't that much food to choose from. The garlic bread burrata was our favorite and seemed like something I could have easily made at home. Skip it.

You get the idea from reading the other reviews here. The concept, the food, all amazing. I agonised whether to give this 4 or 5 stars, and not because of the food, because of the service. Whilst the serving staff are extremely friendly, they are all in a tremendous rush to get somewhere- else. You almost need to stick out your foot to get their attention at times. The 'yum Cha style' or serving is unique but has a huge downfall, if you're sat in an awkward spot you miss out on a lot, like we did. The food though, was amazing and incredibly good. Easily one of the top restaurants in SF, but only 4 stars from me, sadly.

Anytime I see people waiting outside a restaurant prior to opening that doesn't even have it's name on the wall....I know something is happening. This is not like your normal sit down to a nice meal type of dinner. It is really a unique experience.We decided to go after I called and found out that approximately 30% of the tables are available for walk ins. That means at 5:30 there are about 8-10 parties of 2 that will get a table. The rest will have to come back later that night. i am guessing at the number.We arrived at 5:15 and there was a line of about 14 - 18 people in front of us. We were the last two people to get a table. So...if you want to eat at 5:30 get there at around 5:00 on weeknights and earlier than that on Friday and Saturday.We sat at the bar table just to the right as you enter the restaurant. At first I thought it was going to be a terrible location. There were still a lot of people at the entrance to the restaurant right behind us. But soon they had to walk away with rejected looks on their faces. They were either coming back later or on another day.From our view we could see people walking past outside and rubbing their noses on the window as they looked in to see the chef's working. Right in front of us a chef was preparing oysters and other dishes.As other people have said...the format is simple. Choose commandables (not sure what that means) from the menu or choose provisions (another new word when describing food) from the platters that the servers will offer. Each item has the price posted.It is somewhat intimidating at first because the dishes come fast and furious. They explain the dish and you have seconds to decide if you want it or not. After about 30 minutes things start to slow down. The server explained later that if we wanted anything that had already been presented...we just needed to ask.The servings are small. We ended up with 10 or 11 dishes, two deserts and 4 glasses of wine and it came to $160. We passed on the coffee because the server said that they only serve decaf coffee by the pot. Strange.We loved the experience and the food/service was amazing.Definitely worth waiting and the price.

I visited this restaurant during a business trip to the states. I had no reservation so I decided to wait for the opening and try to get one of the few seats they have at the bar. The business idea is incredible, it's a kind of Michelin tapas bar where you can get a lot of appetizers and then get a main course. What I found amazing was the high-standard quality they had in each appetizer I got!

Arrived in SF on a Monday evening armed with a generous gift certificate, from our daughter, to State Bird Provisions.Could not secure a reservation before we left New York but were hopeful to get in as walk-in.To our amazement we scored two seats. Then the party really began! We ordered just a few things off the menu but mostly feasted off the wonderful carts of fanciful and creative inventions from the kitchen. We let our waiter steer us to a lovely flight of Rieslings to accompany our food selections.This was a foodie heaven, and not in a pretentious way! Just delicious.

As a foodie, I look to new restaurant experiences while traveling. I was not prepared to blown away by this place. Reservations must be booked weeks in advance, but if you' re open to a 9 pm (or later) reservation, you can get lucky with less time. I've not been to as inventive or consistent restaurant in some time. While you can order from a menu, the kitchen cooks up a dozen or so small plates during the night that are offered table to table. You pick what you want and turn down the rest. The pork belly was superb. The trout had a delicate broth. The lavender panna cotta memorable. Apricots in cheese - delicious. And the clam/potato/quinoa chowder was out of this world. Dinner for two including a glass of wine and tip around $130. I wouldn't recommend it for large groups because it was loud and it'd be hard to hear others, but there were two large groups and people seemed to be enjoying it.

While we missed the first slot for a walk-in, we got in during the second slot. We had great seats at the bar, meaning we had a good shot at getting food fresh from the oven/grill/etc. At first, the experience of waiters trying to get you to eat their "wares" was a little overwhelming (with so many great choices), but we got the hang of it, and had some truly delicious food, including the "state bird" (quail) and some really good dumplings. Totally worth it for the experience and the food.

I've been wanting to try this for a while. On a recent trip to SF, we couldn't get a reservation so decided to try 'walk-in'. We got there a little early and were very happy that we got the last table of four. The server recommended a lovely wine, we tried many items from the cart, every dish was a delicious as the one before. On the night we were there, if you didn't get something that came around the first time, it was not there the next pass. We've been making a version of the smoked trout-avocado chip dip ever since and always get rave reviews. Pork belly stone fruit salad was amazing as was the grilled octopus with eggplant vinaigrette. Dishes are presented on interesting and unusual plates, service was perfect. We really enjoy the dim sum like approach because we enjoy trying lots of little different things.

We managed to hook a reservation online for 5:30 on a Saturday night. When we got to the restaurant there was already a line of people waiting to get in. The restaurant is interesting in that it has the wait staff present you with different small plates to try (ala dim sum cart style) in addition to having a full menu. The service was a little haphazard at times but accommodating. The food was good overall and I'm a fan of the small plate so I found the style to be refreshing. The stand out really was the dessert though.

I ate at this restaurant with family on a recommendation to one of the party. There were no reservations and we were told that accommodating seven of us would be a challenge and to arrive at 5:30 in the afternoon. I am partially biased as eating that early did not set my palate up for a good experience. We were seated at the time suggested and the service was very good. The food is not my thing--lots of fried offerings including the State Bird--the chicken, so I picked at salads and passed on more than I ate. The fish dish that was ordered was, however, very good. Will I go again if in SF, no. Will I recommend, not for large groups and only to people who are happy with their kind of cuisine.

I live on the East Coast and got up at 3am exactly 60 days in advance to book our reservation at State Bird Provisions (which, by the way, worked like a charm) for our trip to San Francisco. We had high expectations of this Michelin starred restaurant and were not disappointed. We visited for my daughter's 16th birthday and they went out of their way to make the evening special for her - several servers wished her a happy birthday and she enjoyed a special birthday dessert. We loved the concept of American food done dim sum style and everything we tried was inventive and delicious and not like anything we've ever had before. Plus the whole concept is just FUN. My daughter is a pescetarian and they made a note of that and only presented foods to her that she could enjoy which I thought was very cool. Standouts for us included the toasts and pancakes that they present table-side, the fried State Bird (quail) which I enjoyed immensely, and a carrot mochi dish that my daughter loved. We tried several different dishes from the cart that were available just for the evening and they were all special. We left very full and very happy for what I thought was an affordable tab (around $130 for the two of us). Highly recommend State Bird Provisions!

I really wanted to fall in love with State Bird Provisions. My boyfriend and I were celebrating a milestone so we decided, without a reservation to go. Because we missed the first seating right when they opened, we had to wait, which we were prepared to do. We walked around the area (there is nothing here) for about 30 minutes. We went to the supermarket and walked through the aisles in order to kill time. We waited another hour at the milk tea place across the street. We were that serious about being here! Heck, we flew halfway across the world, when would we get another chance to visit? So we waited. When we were finally seated, we got this lovely nook facing the street and the cold prep station, right when you walk in. While this made for an interesting experience as we got to watch them prep, it also made us isolated from the rest of the dining room. What's even better is we also got first dibs on the plates they were serving.NOW FOR THE FOOD: We were underwhelmed. It was just "okay" for us. I wanted to really be blown away. In fact, we ordered practically everything that was offered to us in hopes that we would find things that were as good as all the other reviews say. While the flavors interesting, the ingredients fresh, the presentation lovely, we couldn't find that "oomph" or wow factor in the bites that we took. Even the Burrata Bread and the State Bird Dish which everyone raves about was nothing spectacular. We ordered -Toast & Pancakes: Sourdough&Ricotta, Croque Madame, Yogurt Butter Swordfish FlossCommandables - State BirdDesserts - Lime Granita, Horchata Ice Cream, World Peace MilkOther Stuff (specials for that day) - A Chips & Guac Dip Dish, Oysters, an Avocado, Fresh Spring Rolls, The Sex Bread (Burrata over bread) and other things but i cannot remember, While slightly disappointed with the food, we still had a fun time. We enjoyed the novelty of choosing dishes that piqued our curiosity and the flavors were quite interesting. The staff were fun to chat with and watching them prepare food made time fly. So I guess you could say it's one of those restaurants where you should come for the fun of it and keep in mind the food is only a part of the equation.

The menu also features main dishes to order. Everything is shareable. I found most noteworthy the mixture of textures in each dish: especially the crunch factor, thanks to toasted quinoa, chickpeas, seeds, and many others. The "State Bird" dish is fried quail, and it is delicious!Personally, I would skip their desserts, but other guests liked the ones we chose: cherry granitas and strawberry "ice cream sandwiches".

Excellent food, subpar ambiance and rude manager
