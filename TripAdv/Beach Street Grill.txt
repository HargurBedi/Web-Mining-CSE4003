Looked like a nice spot for lunch.Correct!Great food, one street back from the tourist ridden "front" and an owner (Christine) who is passionate about service and quality, not just a fast buck from passing trade that will likely never re-appear.Chowder was excellent, as was the burger - and grandma's recipe pancakes (on the house) were sinfully delicious!Highly recommended!

Hope to go back tomorrow!

We visited the friendly place for breakfast and were so happy to stumble across it. The food is so fresh and so much to choose from you would never be disappointed. The staff are so efficient and friendly it is a pleasure to go. Their sour dough French toast is absolutely amazing. They have organic and gluten free foods and the fresh fruit cup can easily be shared- fabulous. I think it closes after lunch but we enjoyed breakfast we never needed lunch.

The food at Beach Street Grill is excellent!! While a little pricey it is worth it and you can find a 10% off coupon on one of the tourist maps, in coupon books as well as from some hotel concierge's.The staff is exceptional and as we went there more than once during our visit to San Francisco, they remembered what we liked.Christian and Angel were amazing, very kind and helpful and made the visits to Beach Street Grill that much more enjoyable.

Try this place for breakfast it's a great way to start your day exploring San Francisco.

I had the combo with pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 sausages. The sausage was very flavorful and the pancakes light and fluffy. My husband had the Salmon omelette and the Salmon tasted a bit salty but went well mixed in with the eggs and side of hashbrowns. Remember that it is organic, so each plate will cost you an average of $13-$19.

Serving good value breakfast all day with egg, sausages and beacon, and service was fast and basic. Taking a bit of getting used to the American beacon which are more like jerky strips. Watch the portion size, particularly with the pancakes. The sourdough toast was flavoursome with the local jam and honey .

Under recommendation of hotel, headed over to cafe. I must say first impression was that it was nothing to shout about, but after tasting the food, i must say it made us visit them twice in a roll. The servers were nice, food were fresh and cooked well. Try the burritos and pancakes. You can ask them to change any of the ingredients if you have allergies and they do have gluten free options as well. The yougurt with fruits were also a very refreshing and welcoming choice.

We made it over to the beach street grill - not too far from Pier 39. As the days was unseasonably hot, we were parched & close to heat stroke when we finally agreed to a lunch spot. The wait staff was wonderfully kind, making sure we had ice water & a cool spot inside. The food is good, a bit overpriced- but considering the area, more affordable than options on pier 39. They were kind enough to refill our water bottles before heading back out in the heat.

We visited on a Sunday morning for breakfast - when we arrived all the outside tables were taken but the inside was relatively empty, but after half an hour or so the inside was pretty full too.Our waitress was very friendly and we soon had some coffee on the go, and she explained the menu very clearly. Our food was delivered in a reasonable time - we all had different dishes - and it was all very tasty.The atmosphere in the restaurant was great although we're not sure about the benefit of having news channels showing on the TVs when they have no sound or subtitles...The prices are a little on the high side but I guess that is what you'd expect given the location.Would we eat breakfast there again? Yes we would, if we're ever back in town.

We tried to go to the nearby IHOP but there was a ridiculously long queue so headed back to the Beach St Grill which we had walked passed, and had grabbed our attention. Food was good, tasty and although they didn't quite get our order right, no harm was done. It wasn't cheap, but then neither is anywhere in Fisherman's Wharf.Tables were large and seats were very comfortable though.Would I eat here again? - yes, but I'd also try other places too.

We had breakfast here a couple of times and the food is excellent.The service swift and efficient. I guess it has to be because of the limited number of tables.

By all means try the homemade jam.

We were looking forward to this place, since it servers Organic and gluten free options. We were not disappointed by the food - it was great! I had an omelet with bacon, cheese, sour cream, bacon, and avocado (yum!) and my wife had the gluten free biscuit, english muffin and organic fruit. Everything was delicious, and my only gripe is how much they charge for the gluten free options. The bill does not look right, and even though the waitress explained that it was their system, I still think we were overcharged. Another plus - you can see Coit tower right from your table!  Regardless - it was a great place to eat, great food, great location!

Love this place! Not the cleanest or classiest but definitely the coolest. Classic American breakfast diner with everything you want on a menu. The best pancakes in town are here- you don't need to check out anywhere else. Grandma's old family recipe and you can even buy the mix to take home.I love the experience here, the chairs aren't the comfiest, the bathrooms need a good scrub, the mugs could do with updating but you can see through this and enjoy the food, the great service and the experience.On another commendable note, I noticed the owner giving free coffee to the street people which I love. Kind hearted people are what makes this world go round. Thank you for looking after the least and the lost.

Those with coeliac disease will be all too familiar with the frustrating experience ofplaces which claim to offer Gluten free options which either are (a) basically the offer of a salad and (b) worse still - not as described and result in sickness. After a surprising dearth of options in San Francisco, I was so happy to find this place which actually offered breakfast options that were GF! We came here twice and enjoyed gluten free French toast and pancakes respectively, both of which were served with fruit and real maple syrup and weighing in at a competitive price. Don't put off by the seating system which seems a little confusing at first. The staff are friendly but clearly the demand is high for tables. I was won over immediately by the character of a dapper gentleman who beckoned us in almost as if we were being welcomed into a secret society. Once seated, things were lovely from start to finish.

The first morning in San Francisco we were in a bit of a rush to have breakfast because we had a tour booked that morning. I found this spot on trip advisor and decided we would go there because they were close. I had the best sourdough French toast I've ever had and my son had a bacon omelette that had a ton of bacon in it! We ended up going back the next morning. The third morning I wanted to try something different so we went to Hollywood Cafe, a recommendation from the guy at our hotel. Not impressed at all. So needless to say we decided why give up on a good thing and ate there again our last morning. Friendly service, not terribly expensive, and the best food we are the entire trip!

After walking up and down the street peeking in at various restaurants between Pier 39 and the end of Beach Street, this was clearly the one (and thank goodness because we were hungry!). The service was fast at every point (getting seated, receiving menus, receiving coffee, our food coming out, getting the check), yet I didn't feel at all rushed. Our server was friendly and answered questions about the menu. Love that they had irish oats, seems like a unique menu option for breakfast. Though I was tempted by the Irish oats, I had the homemade granola pancakes. Until then it never would have occurred to me to add granola to pancake batter - now it's a favorite. Delicious pancakes! I would recommend this place for breakfast.

This restaurant is a must-do when in San Francisco. Christine is the owner and provides a level of customer service you so rarely see anymore. Christine went above-and-beyond to insure that she delivered the highest quality product, using creativity and special touches that were completely unexpected. She did this with very little advance notice and exceeded expectations by a long shot. It is wonderful to see an owner who cares as much as she does to provide a superior end product, to add the personal touch to it and to do it all with a smile and ease. Beach Street Grill is a gem, Christine is a very special person. I am confident anyone who goes there will be happily satisfied! Debbie

Looking for a decent breakfast near Fishermans' Warf and had this place suggested.Well it was certainly busy and deserved to be popular. The food is good and wholesome, just what we were after. We had a selection of cooked items, including vegetarian and all were good. I even managed to get a half decent cup of Earl Grey, but as in keeping with everywhere I have been in the US over several trips, half decent is as good as it gets. Do not expect a builders brew anywhere!Now at first I thought the prices a bit steep when you add in the OJ, coffee and extra toast, but as we spent a few days in the city we found that pries here are generally steeper than we expected. So I would say that this place is actually quite good value when you consider the quality of the food.The bathroom however was not as sparkly as it could be - bit of a let down.OK, good food, reasonable prices, very popular.

Good basic food and they use Niman Ranch meats. My husband normally orders bacon/cheddar omelettes to which he normally says "Meh" when I ask how his meal was, this was pretty good according to him. So much so that he ordered it on our third day there. I had the breakfast burrito the first morning and while it was pretty darn good, the salsa was amazing and I wish it came with extra (I also wish they had a chorizo option). Another morning I had the sourdough french toast with berries, absolutely perfect. For our last meal there I had the granola pancakes which I thought were rather dry, and he and our daughter thought the biscuits and gravy were fine but there wasn't enough gravy so they felt the ratio of biscuit to gravy was off. 

Once was enough.

Nice people, but there were three of us and none of our breakfasts were that good (vegetarian omelette, eggs Florentine, eggs Benedict). The first omelette wasn't cooked all the way through, the second looked different and the mushrooms tasted like metal, though I have to say they handled my complaint very well and graciously. All of us only half ate everything. I question "organic" when used loosely like they did. The photo postings should have warned me.....

We chose Beach Street Grill as they are Gluten Free Friendly (my partner is Coeliac) & we ate here 3 out of the 4 days we were in San Francisco.They have a large choice of food which is always good quality and the staff are very friendly. I now have a liking for pancakes and maple syrup!The food is great value for money as well.Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area

We had a simple breakfast with French toast, bacon, coffee and 1 OJ and the bill was $35 before tip. It was OK but not a high end place by ANY means. Across the street is Darin's Cafe and the offerings there are comparable. We had a similar breakfast there and the service was top notch. If you like pho they have it and several other Asian dishes that looked very good. The bill at Darin's was $25 with tip.

We were told about this spot by our concierge, who provided a discount coupon for it. A block away we had a choice of so many varieties of breakfast that were made with truly organic fare. We ate all our breakfasts here and listened to the 60's music piped in.

A must for Gluten Free folks!

What a cracking find this place was!MY girlfriend can't eat gluten anymore :( and all she really wanted was pancakes. We found this place on the internet some where and headed down. Lovely greeting from the owner and staff are incredibly friendly and keen to help! We could only fit in going here three times but it would have been every day if we could! The GF pancakes were incredible and clearly made by someone who actually cares for GF, I can eat gluten and I couldn't tell the difference, have a look at the photos if you want to see! There are other GF options including Eggs Benedict which I had one day, so don't assume there is only pancakes! A must go to if you need GF, bit pricey but you pay for what you get!Wish this place was in London!

Our go-to breakfast place, and has good gluten free options

Loved it here, very quirky. It isnt flash, it looks like something out of a seventies TV show, and the music matches, but the service is fast and friendly and the food is great. No lunch required if have breakfast here! Best of all for my travelling companion they offer real gluten free options and take gluten intolerance seriously. Thanks ladies, you rock!

fantastic gluten free find

This cafe unfortunately wasn't great value for money. Our family of 4, visiting from Australia, had breakfast here. The meals that my husband and I had were ok, but the portion size (for the smoked salmon eggs Benedict, in particular) was small and the food therefore overpriced compared to a fantastic nearby cafe which we had dined at the previous day. On the upside, the kids enjoyed their Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes, the coffee was good and the service friendly. 

Gluten free $$$$$$$ Breakfast options

We were so happy to find a restaurant that had gluten free options. They also have organic options. Well here is the scoop Gluten free is a premium $3 sur charge on all Gluten free item and they ise UDI's and Pamelas brand products. Breakfast for family of 5 was $91. We're talking pancakes, bacon and omlettees and one crab benedict. Food was good, service was weak, waitress was grouchy. If you need Gluten free this is a good option, just be prepared to pay for it.
