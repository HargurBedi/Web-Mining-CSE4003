The line out the door was our first indication....it's a true hole in the wall. The pizza tastes like what I imagine pizza tastes like in Italy. Excellent sauce, quality dough, fresh ingredients. The Caesar salad didn't have much taste but I don't think many people go there for salad. They sell by the slice, nice option. 

Delicious, huge and cheap

Great meal for not much. Had a medium chicken special pizza and shared it between 2 of us. It was huge and filled us both up. Delicious pizza wasn't too hot when it came out and the thin crust was awesome. Table service was attentive and polite. Highly recommended

We found Za just down the street from where we were staying in Russian Hill. Our hosts said it was the best pizza in the city and it did not disappoint. Only about 4 tables or so for inside seating so depending upon the time of day, you may need to get it to go. Staff was friendly and efficient and the pizza was very tasty. Pizza is one of those items that varies regionally and people have their preferences, but for our money, this was very good pizza. We'll come back on our next visit to San Francisco.

Za pizzas are absolutely delicious, ingredients are fresh and pizza is cooked perfect. What adds to the experience is the friendly and welcoming staff who treat you like they have known you for ever, they made us feel very comfortable and offered great service.The only dissapointing thing about this restraunt is that i live in Australia and they dont have a store in my country, there fore i have to wait to visit san Francisco agian before i can try their beautiful pizzas.

Small place, limited seating, service was awesome....he was totally helpful and on top of things!! We ordered two medium pizza's, one on the menu and one not....and a large Cesar's salad. The pizza was out of this world!! The crust is positively spectacular. Price is a little costly for a medium....but the ingriedents are all fresh and top notch, so it was worth it. Will most surely return again for more!!

We visited Za Pizza as part of our US roadtrip 2017. After spending several hours in a car we went out to eat quite late around 9 PM. Even though Za Pizza closes at 22 PM the place was packed! Many locals popping in and out of the small eatery with only a few tables inside and outside. The atmosphere was so nice and friendly that we decided to try to wait for a table. Luckily we were told that it would only take about 10 minutes before we could be seated inside. It was worth the wait! We ordered the largest pizza and it was huge! We have two big kids (11 and 14) and they eat a lot but we had more than enough to make everybody happy. Furthermore we ordered a large Garden Salat to share. We were served 4 big bowls of nice and crispy salat. Wauw, it was so good!I really like the fact that the menu is quite simple and the quality of the food is high. It is no nonsense food accompanied by a very friendly staff.I hope that I will visit the great city of San Francisco again. When that happensI will definitely eat at Za Pizza again. :-D

I had researched before coming to SF and this was on our list as our two fussy boys are big pizza fans! This place absolutely hit the spot and totally lived up to our expectations. You'd pretty much miss it walking by as it looks unassuming and tiny from the outside. However the smells and queue of people will pique your curiousity. Expect to wait for a table or if you're prepared to sit outside you may get seated sooner. We sat outside as our rumbling tummies were in charge. The menu is concise, with a short list of specialities and then the option tochoose your own toppings. The red potato pizza looked mouthwatering and BIG! The usual disagreement between the kids erupted over what to have but this place has the solution - slices!! Why does nowhere in the UK do this?? We each had a different slice - cheese, pepperoni, spicy sausage and vegetarian - and all were equally delicious! The bases were extra crispy due to the addition of polenta. A slice was enough to fill us all even Dad. We washed it down with a pale(yum) and amber ale(yummier). Total cost incl two cokes was about $40 - bargain! The staff are efficient, friendly and totally on the ball as you'd have to be due to the constant flow of people. Put your pretensions to one side and you will not be disappointed!

In spite of the small place and large numbers of customer looking for either a table or for pizza to go, the service was great and we could find a table outside within 20 min. The MoMA pizza with mushrooms onions artichoke hearts and fresh basil we chose was humongous but so good we felt compelled to finish it. The onions oh so sweet, good tomato, tasty mushrooms and not soggy artichokes. The dough was also good, minding the fact the oven is not wood fired.

There needs to be an option for a 6/5 on here because this pizZA is the bomb! Most amazing pizza I've had in years. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They'll pour your beer right to the rim and the pizza is just so perfect. The crust has a nice crisp, the ingredients are as fresh as can be, and there is just enough sauce to not make your pie soggy which tastes amazing. Forget the 6/5, I'm saying 400/5.... Wow

I don't know how long Za has been open, but they're gonna blow up before too long. It's off the tourist track and has a very neighborhood feel, and it's small...maybe 25 seats. The food is outstanding, a kind of NY style thin crust that is uncanny in being both chewy and crunchy. We had a short wait for a seat at lunchtime on a weekday. A line of 12 people formed quickly behind us, but by the time our belated Uber arrived 20 minutes after we cashed out, all had been seated. The proprietor was gracious and personable, there's an open kitchen so you can watch the crew at work. Two giant slices, a salad, a soda and a beer was under $25. If you're anywhere nearby and like a good thin crust, you can't go wrong with a try here.

We were staying at a hotel close to Za and wanted to have a pizza delivered. It took over 25 minutes to get through as the phone would ring and ring and ring (you get the idea) and then just hang up. The other option was the busy signal. Za was recommended by the front desk of the hotel and I called to get another recommendation. Thought I'd give it one more try and miraculously got through. The pizza was OK but very expensive compared to what I would pay at home from my local pizza place. I know this is San Francisco but $38+ for a pizza is a bit much.

We were staying at Pier 2620 Hotel, Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights and decided to visit this restaurant due to the great reviews. It was necessary to climb the hill in Hyde Street (which gave us the fantastic view of the city and the bridge from it's junction with Lombard Street) in order to reach ZA PIZZA. There was a small queue on arrival but we were made aware the wait wouldn't be long and we were happy to take in the great atmosphere and check out the menu, beers and specials. The staff certainly earned their money and were very busy, polite and friendly. We quickly were sat at a table ( there were 5 inside and two outside) and served with a good beer $5.50. The pizzas were excellent and could be ordered, medium, large or per slice . A very casual style of restaurant with great food and reasonable prices. Loved it.

I've been coming here for 10 years.....the flavors here, both in term of the pizza and the people, are the best kind of local stuff you could ask for. When you walk in the cozy little space you are greeted with warmth, humor and recognition by the owners and folks who work here.....like you are one of the family (or will be very soon if this is your first visit). The pizza is perfect (by NYC standards), perfectly thin crispy crust with just the right amount of goodies on top. There is generally a good mix of trad and new-age topped slices ready to go, or order a full pizza and get it customized to what you want. Add a salad (HUGE) and one of their SF Bay Area based beers, and you'll be in heaven. Go on a Giants game day and expect to get caught up in the game, which will be on the TV. For out of town visitors this is a fabulous slice (pun intended) of local life in a typical little SF neighborhood, Russian Hill. Go....you'll come back again and again.

Not bad pizzas

When we arrived, the waiter he was one of those non smilers and didn't acknowledge us at the door, bit of a crap start but we thought we'll give it a few minutes. At last we were given a table and ordered the meatier options and shared a medium sized pizza which is enough for two as recommended by the unsmiling waiter. Pizza was good but you had to add the herbs or parmesan or chilli flakes that were available on the table to season to how you would like it. Decor is pretty cool with amateurish drawings by kids/adults of the pizza theme. Toilets however and the area outside of this looked a bit grubby. There were unwashed giant pots on the floor and floor looked like it needed a good scrub. To sum it up, I've had way better pizzas in New York, London, Italy and in Brighton.

Good pizza for a PRICE.

I know the food is a little more expensive in San Francisco, but I still don't get paying $20 for a medium cheese pizza. Sure, their pizza is pretty good, but I'd pay $11 for the same thing back home from a local pizza place (not a chain). So, I guess if you're in the area and want a pizza that doesn't come from a snobbery, this is your only option. But the prices do NOT make it very reasonable. If you want a pizza with a variety of toppings, or a large pizza, get ready to pay over $30 each for them...

Delicious!

Had this pizza for a late night dinner when in San Francisco. I tried the spicy Italian sausage and green pepper pizza and I thought it was amazing. Great taste with just the right amount of 'kick.' They also deliver (to a hotel in my case) and it was there within 45 minutes. Would have again for sure.

I was staying at Hilton and at about 9pm I had an urge for a pizza. I looked on tripadvisor and found this place. The pizza is great. The place is nice. The workers were nice. Great help in finding this one. Highly recommended.

We happened on this place 10 years ago, and was hoping it was still here. It is and still serving some of the best pizza in San Francisco. You can actually ride the Hyde Powell cable car almost to the front door.

Overall the restaurant is phenomenal! The service is really good and the employees couldn't be any nicer. The restaurant may be small, but it's super good and is great for anyone who wants to have pizza. Yay for Za Pizza!

small place with lots of carryout, special pizzas by the slice or order a whole one of your own making; two small tables outside allow for the always fun people watching in San francisco; for a pizza restaurant-the wine by the glass was amazingly good! Happy service! one pizza feeds two very easily.

Fabulous Pizza and amazing salads, family friendly and reasonable value

I went there with my partner and 3 teenage sons. We had great pizzas, one of the boys had a massive salad (yes really!) It was all delicious. They serve wine too. It was August when we went and I do remember we phoned to check they were open and had to rush as they don't stay open late. Once we got there it was fine and they didn't rush us to finish so they could go home, relaxed young people working there. Recommended!

Adorable place, love the owner!

We were looking everywhere for just a nice piece of pizza and most places were so crowded we couldn't sit down. Found this place by accident and enjoyed excellent pizza and salad with wonderful dressing. The owner, from Boston originally, very friendly and fun.

Probably the best pizza

Went to get two large pizzas and for a weekday the place was packed with people eating inhouse and waiting on collections - check as I think they do free local delivery which is probably useful. Had to wait about 15 minutes while they did the pizza but a great place to people watch. The pizzas were good and the staff friendly. A great place to have.Much better than some of the pizza chains.
