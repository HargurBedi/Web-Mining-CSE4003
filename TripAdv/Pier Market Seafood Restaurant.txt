The place invited us in! Those Dungeness!, the sourdough soup, the calamari fritti!! We sat at the bar only for some good beer then we met Rosy, the bartender, also the entertainer! She treated us so so good and make us laugh along with other servers! They are a great team and Rosy treats them so good!!! Beers are A+ , very cold!, we saw Rosy making a nice bloody Mary and she added a shrimp!, woww!!! We ordered french fries with garlic, parsley and cheese on too, best french fries ever! We also ordered the calamari Lord!, they were so so good and fresh! The sourdough with the clam chowder inside was a first timer and it was delicious!We loved this place and the good vives!

We had lunch here 4 times during a two-week stay in SF last month. Forget the 'touristy' location and just enjoy the great seafood (eg. scampi, fish and chips, swordfish steak- all with that west coast touch). Great wine list too and local beers.Sit outside if you can and enjoy the balmy breezes. Friendly and attentive service too. This was our favourite restaurant in San Francisco.

I am not a fan of Pier 39. It I.S geared up for tourists and quality and value is often questionable. However we wanted to eat and after walking up and down the pier we decided to give Pier Market a go and were pleasantly surprised. Food quality was good and very fresh and dish sizes were really big. Prices were not cheap but equally not excessive and service was attentive. I would certainly eat here again and compares favourably to most of Pier 39

The fish was cooked to perfection, vegetables and potatoes very tasty. My husband ordered Jambalaya, there was loads of meat and fish in it and was very tasty. Portion sizes good, Restaurant and toilets very clean, and the staff attentive. We highly recommend a visit.

We went there for dinner, so we couldn't enjoy the views. I guess that may make a difference!the food was ok, I had Salmon and it was very good. At the entrance they show the fish cuts they have, and I have to say that was one of the reasons to choose this place.My wife ordered fish and chips but we got fired calamary instead......the waiter offer us to change it when we told him, but she decided to take the calamary (we were tired and it was late, so we didn't want to wait).They offer some local beers on draft, that's something I like!summarizing, it is ok. Nothing special.

Wandering around Pier 39 and time for dinner, had to be seafood so off to the Pier Market Seafood Restaurant.Even though we didn't have a reservation and the establishment seemed to be pretty full, was shown to a table in a quiet part of the restaurant with a great view overlooking the water.A great selection on the menu with heaps of seafood options. Ended up ordering Fish & Chips, Crab Cakes and the Clam Chowder in a Cob loaf.Food was soon served and was delicious. Good sized portions and the clam chowder in the cob was to die for.The whole feel of the restaurant was great and mixed with the food was a great dining experience. Prices okay except for the crab cakes, what you paid for what you got, seemed a bit over priced when compared to the other meals.Overall - a very enjoyable meal.

Travelling solo can make eating out tricky but this restaurant is very friendly to single dinners. The only catch is the size of the servings for the starters is so large it's best split across two.My server (Melanie) was very helpful, nothing as too much trouble, the food arrived fast and tasted fantastic. I had the fried calamari as a starter followed by the grilled salmon which was perfectly done. Prices are a little touristy due to the location but the view is amazing and justifies the extra. Definitely worth a second visit.

The food was excellent in taste but starters were served after all the main courses. Mind you their bread is all sour dough so if you're not a fan you should do an other pick. Irish coffee was pure whisky, we'd advise to stay away from it.

What a great find! Dined here with a group of friends whilst visiting the Fisherman's Wharf and we were not disappointed one bit. Our plan was to have dinner at an 'upmarket' restaurant on at least one day of our 5 night stay but we did not think that would be at Fisherman's Wharf! Everything from the wine, cocktails, starters and mains was of the absolute highest quality with some unique dishes and flavours combining to satisfy our hunger! We ordered a mixture of seafood and steak dishes and each was as delightful as the other. Presentation was top notch and taste to match as we devoured our food in no time! If my memory serves me correctly, the bill came up to around $330 for 6 of us so roughly $55 each which i feel was a fair price given the number of drinks and starters we ordered along with mains. The restaurant definitely had a family friendly ambiance if you are wondering as they cleverly placed parties depending on group makeup to avoid seating children with those plowing through cocktails and wine! All in all, great food, great atmosphere and great customer service at a reasonable price is win win for me! Highly recommended!

I took a friend from the East Coast to Pier 39 and told her she had to try the Cioppino. We split Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and the cioppino. The clam chowder was tasty. The bread bowl was a bit chewy instead of crusty. I have heard that is how most places make the bowl so that you an tear it easier, but I prefer a crusty bread. The Cioppino was not bad but I was a bit deflated after telling my friend how delicious it was and it the Pier Market version was just bland. My version that I make at home has more flavor. I would not get this here again.

We visited Pier Market Seafood Restaurant for dinner. It was not our first time in Pier 39, but it was on this restaurant.With a perfect location, the atmosphere, especially in the night, is beautiful, with the perfect light, wood materials, close to the water.Menu is right, with several options to choose, all of them appetizing. Finally we ordered several dishes from the menu, because we wanted to taste some. All of them delicious.However, despite have been served at the beginning really quick, once we finished our dinner, our waiter had disappeared. We were looking for him, because we wanted to have another drink and some desert. However, when he came near our table, he turned around, looked away...20 or 25 minutes after we have finished dinner, I stood up and requested the bill.We were not lucky with our waiter, because the restaurant and food are excellent. Not the staff service we got.Good value for money.Booking is recommended.

We ate here on Aug 16th '17, after a trip to Alcatraz. The menu is extensively fish as you would expect from Fisherman's Wharf. We had the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl to start between two of us and it was the best chowder we have had. Thick, creamy and crammed with clams and potatoes, it really hit the spot. Then we had blackened Pacific rock cod and ahi tuna. The tuna came out blackened by mistake and the server asked us to try it to see what we thought. Unfortunately, the spices masked the delicate flavour of the tuna so we sent it back and they refired. The mesquite grilled vegetables were so tasty and the cod came with a Cajun remoulade that pulled the whole dish together nicely. The location is fantastic as you would expect with Pier39.Overall we really liked the food but felt the tuna should never have made it out to us with the blackened spices on and because it was refired, it took 5 minutes for it to come out again, which meant I was eating alone.

Busy Friday afternoon at the Pier. Hubby and I went to escape the heat of the valley.We wanted a sourdough bread bowl with clam chowder at Boudin $9.99, also on the pier, but with the 20%off this was only a few cents more and came with a side salad $12.95 (prior to discount). Tip: If you have AAA membership, the visitor's center give a 20% off at this restaurant and they will validate 1 hr parking. They also have a quick service counter that also validates parking and gives the 20% off. We were given a pager with a 20 min expected wait. The quick service line was long too. We ended up getting in that line & said we'll eat wherever we're served 1st....and our buzzer went off! We were seated by a manager who was very good & he checked on us, even after we got our server who was ok. Warm bread served while we waited. The bread bowl was hot and filling, along with the side salad. Lot of carbs! Our view was not great but we could see the water a little bit. I was hoping to sit by the windows. Bathrooms were coed which I guess is the new norm now, but they were clean and better than the pier public restrooms. There were lot's of people eating here and the staff seemed to keep up and do a good job. We'd come back. Boudin is a quick service, so it was a nicer atmosphere at Pier Market.

We went for dinner on a Friday night. Waited 15 minutes for a table. They gave pagers so you could still shop and look around. We had a part of 5 and we were sat near a window so we could watch the boats and see the water. Had the ahi tuna and potatoes. Thought the potatoes would be bland but were delicious and so was the tuna. Fresh sour dough bread was given with the meal. Our waiter was helpful and quick to fill our waters. Would highly recommend this restaurant if you are a Pier 39

As a child I remember a family friend would serve home made cioppino for special occasions so when planning a visit to S.F. I did some research to find good cioppino without breaking the bank. It appeared The Pier Market was the most reasonably priced & the pictures of the restaurant looked pleasant.We were there for an early dinner so seating wasn't a problem. We had a nice view of the boats on the water. To start we were served warm garlic sourdough bread. After a little wait the nicely presented entre' arrived. We started by removing some shells & dug right in. The seafood was cooked just right, the tomato stew was flavorful, & the little bit of linguini noodles were done al dente. The wait service was fine & we were satisfied with the bill. All in all The Pier Market was a good choice.

We decided to try the Pier Market after a recommendation from someone. It was about 7 pm so the pier was heaving. We hadn't booked, but a friendly lady told us a table would be ready in about 10 minutes, and she gave us a pager. In less than 10 the pager buzzed and we were on our way. We were seated inside next to the window looking over the water and fancy boats. Could see some sea lions who had ventured away from the mass and were playing on the pier/water near us.We had worked up an appetite and were ready to enjoy a big meal. We had crab cakes and sour dough garlic bread, followed by jambalaya, breaded shrimp and chicken with garlic potatoes and veg. It was all delicious and of ample quantity. My son said the chicken was the best he had tasted in a restaurant! Thus was washed down with local lager. We were served by a friendly and attentive waitress who made us feel very welcome. The water and bread was put on our table almost immediately. It's such a pleasure to eat in American restaurants - British establishments could learn a lot from them about customer service. We normally have to request water in the UK and even then it could take a while arriving. We had such a lovely evening at the Pier Market and heartily recommend it for ambiance and choice and quality of food

We went for dinner and were seated quickly, great server. Wings were ok, my son loved his grilled cheese, the chowder in sourdough was fantastic and my husband said his salmon cake burger was okay--too much filler for his taste. Can look out into the bay and see the sea lions off to the side.

Good Seafood with a view

Went to this restaurant with my daughter for dinner. When we arrived we where given a beeper and told wait would be around 25 minutes. We went and looked around the rest of Pier 39 and about 10 minutes later our table was ready. Quite a good menu to select from. We both choose the swordfish which came with potatoes and vegetables and the service was quick.We had a nice view from our table and both enjoyed our meal

We dropped by Pier 39 while touring San Francisco on our way to the Napa Valley and had lunch at this restaurant. We tried the clam chowder on sourdough bread and the teriyaki salmon with green salad. The clam chowder was good and the salmon was just okay. We had a window table with a view of the San Francisco Bay.

Lovely lunch

We came here upon the reviews of others. We were pretty disappointed. I got the crab cakes and my husband got the fried shrimp. My crab cakes were pretty good. Husbands shrimp tasted pretty much like any shrimp. Our little plates for the bread were dirty. So I tried the plates at the table next to us. They were dirty. So were the ones at the next table over. So we decided to just not use a plate. Husbands water also had something black floating around...even after she got him a "new" glass of water. It was okay...but probably would not return. Oh, they also add a 5% fee to the bill. It helps pay the employees health insurance. I asked what the fee was for. 

Excellent

We came here for an early lunch before Alcatraz. My son is not a by fan of fish, but I recommended the clam chowder to try. He ordered the bowl with fries and I ordered the clam chowder in sourdough bread with salad. We sat overlooking the pier and we both enjoyed our meals. The service was excellent,looked after by Hillary. My son polished his bowl of chowder with no problem. The dressing on my salad was very tasty which went very well with the chowder. This was one of our best meals in San Francisco. Food,service and location was excellent.

Just OK

The service was good. The food was average. Clams made me sick and I was throwing up all night. Definitely a tourist spot.

Stopped in for a late lunch. We were quickly seated at an outside table that was great for people watching and greeted by our server Mo. who was quite personable. Crab Cakes , Dungess crab, Chowder in a bread bowl were excellent as was the chocolate cake for desert

So worth it!

Food was great! I don't like crab cakes, but my husband told me to try a bite...it was amazing!!! I had the grilled shrimp, he had the ciopino. Our son is a very picky eater and really wanted pizza, which is NOT on the menu. The GM heard him asking about pizza as we were walking in and whispered if he wanted it, he would have it brought over from one of their other restaurants. That kind of service is a rarity these days!! Food was out quick and a big hit for this family of 4!!

Great food, beautiful view!

Great recommendation of the Swordfish by the waitress. Appreciated the warming lamps on a cold SF night. But Bob, the seagull that only eats butter, was the Real crowd pleaser.A lovely experience =).

Food was amazing, we had the fried platter which contained Cod, shrimp and calamari, which was the first time my wife and I ate calamari and it was DELICIOUS.atmosphere was great we seat next to a window looking out on the pier, we could see the sea lions and Golden gate bridge. Service was excellent and we had no wait time to be seated. We will be back if we ever get back to San Francisco.

This was an easy restaurant with kids! The view was good. They had plenty of good choices for everyone. Service was good. I had a reservation which I think you will need during the busy time of year. Overall if you are traveling to this area with kids in tow ... this was a good restaurant choice.

Great Location

We had a great window seat with a view of the Pier 39 sea lions. Nice place to get in out of the rush of the crowd.... and the crab legs were delicious!

My mom and I had lunch at Pier Market - the server was very attentive (almost to a fault) and the food was good, not amazing, but not bad. I had the trout and it was delicious - very fresh - mom had crab cakes and was pleased.

Quick, fresh and reasonably prices
