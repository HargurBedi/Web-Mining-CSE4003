Visiting with cruise ship. Invited by cousin for lunch. Walking distance from cruise terminal...about 20 min. The inside was very nice and charming. There is an elevator that takes you to the restrooms. There are eating rooms also on this floor, very charming atmosphere. Waiters were very friendly and helpful. The menu was very fresh. We had been to San Francisco many times but never knew of this place. We enjoyed the meal and our introduction to hellenistic cuisine. Definite would recommend this experience for others to try. Thanks again for a great meal and conversation with my cousin and our waiter about food and Greece and Crete.

Hands down the best Greek food in a lovely restaurant. Don't' come here if you are looking for a TV to watch the game . . . this is a 1st class food extravaganza. Everything from the handmade Greek coffees to the freshly roasted on the spit lamb or chicken - it is nothing short of spectacular. Yes, spectacular comes at a cost . . . worth every penny! Don't miss it if you are looking for a special event evening and be sure to make reservations in advance.

There weren't any reservations available, so our small group of three arrived at 5 to hopefully snag a seat at the bar for dinner. Luck for us there were a few cancellations and we were seated for dinner. This was the second time here for us. We mainly ordered appetizers and split the lamb main course. The service was excellent, almost as good as the food.

We went to dinner with another couple and everyone was wowed by our meals. From the hummus to the fried cheese and octopus for appetizers to the lamb and chicken entrees and finishing with baklava, chocolate cake and fresh donuts with honey drizzle, it was all delicious. The service was friendly (she was fun) and attentive. The restaurant is good size with a large bar area. Make reservations.

Kokkari is a large, upscale, popular Greek restaurant in the North Beach district. The service is attentive. They have a limited selection of bottled beers but a large wine list. The menu has a wide variety of traditional & special Greek appetizers & main courses -fish & lamb especially. Reservations are recommended

In town for one day and had to have dinner at Kokkari. Made the reservation one month in advance and well worth the planning. We started with a greek salad and then a special corn feta butter appetizer. Out of this world. The chicken was superb as was the lamb kabobs. We wanted to try a desert but were too full from the main courses.This restaurant is certainly worth dinning at.

Delicious food and a great night out!

My husband and I dined here one evening during our stay in San Francisco. It was our first visit to the city and there are so many restaurants to choose from!It was very busy on the Wednesday evening we visited and there was a convivial and welcoming atmosphere.Staff were efficient and friendly and the food was fab! I'm a vegetarian and there were several interesting options for me to choose from making it difficult for me to decide for a change! I opted for a selection of starters including stuffed vine leaves (OMG!!), zucchini cakes and filo parcels - all were delicious! My husband had the octopus to start and then the chicken and he really enjoyed them both.Wine menu was extensive too  I had made the booking well in advance after reading reviews on TA - so glad I did as we had a really delightful evening.

Our last visit was in 2012. I have always wanted to return. So we took the opportunity on the day we were in town. Our friend, Valerie, was available because her school was closed to the wildfires. We decided to go the mezes route and ordered a lot of different things. The saganaki and the grilled octopus were both fantastic. The latter was tender and not rubbery. We also had three spreads: tzatsiki, favosalata, and taramosalata. The last was the best. All were served with fresh pita. We also tried the lamb souvlaki. It was wonderful. Our server, Todd, took excellent care of us. We had two different wines and Greek coffee. Even the desserts were delicious! This is one of the best places around!

We made reservations and went to the first seating around 5:15 PM. The restaurant filled up very quickly I would recommend making a reservation. We started with three appetizers between the four of us. We tried three different hummus drips and we thought the original hummus was the best. We also had the octopus which was fantastic and zucchini bites were just good. I'd skip them and the 2 other flavored hummus dips next time. Branzino was the best we've ever had! Must try. Baklava ice cream is a must try as well. Great experience here. Service was spot on.

Kokkari used to be the finest Greek restaurant in the Bay Area, and among the best restaurants in the country. But success has clearly come at a price: our last two meals there were sadly mediocre, and at these prices, such a second-rate experience is just not acceptable. Too many choices, too much talent in this town.One suggestion: lose the heat lamps...my roasted potatoes and lamb had been left for several minutes "under the sun." Again, just not good enough.

I have eaten here a number of times and I've never, ever had anything I wouldn't order again. I enjoy Greek food and this restaurant has a wonderful variety with fresh and well presented meals on menu and as specials.

This is a "go to" place for lunch with friends when in San Francisco. The restaurant has a very comfortable atmosphere. The menu (Greek/Mediterranean) has excellent choices,, the employees are all so nice, and the price is moderate. I always have a great experience when I go there. It is within easy walking distance from BART. (Embarcadero Station).

If you love Greek food, Kokkari has it...all of the traditional favorites, wood-fired spit for roasting meats, great wine selection. In general, service is excellent. Unless you plan to arrive by 4:30 and eat at the bar, make a reservation, as far in advance as possible. My only problem with Kokkari is that one or two of the bartenders are aloof jerks. If it had happened once where they were rude answering a question about something (e.g. Q: "Do you like this wine?", A: "I like all our wines" accompanied by an annoyed look), I would have written it off as a bad day. But no, it has happened several times. The success is going to their heads.

what a fantastic experience. this place has been on my to-do list for years and was finally able to make itit's gorgeous inside. so warm and inviting with a beautiful fireplace roasting pork and lamb. it seems the front room is the place to be with upholstered chairs, but we preferred to sit in the larger back room which seemed a little less formal, larger and has a view of the kitchen.service was impeccable, wine list was extensive and very fairly priced, with enough options by the glass.we opted to share one main and four starters. I highly recommend this approach as there wasn't a single starter we didn't want to try.starter standouts were the grilled octopus and peirinli which is baked pita stuffed with figs, ricotta and olives, topped with caramelized onions. seriously one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. watermelon and feta was a very refreshing break from the heavier appswe had the lamb shank with orzo for a main. it was good, but next time I will try a different entree. there were lots of specials that night which made it difficult to choosepro tip: at exactly opening time (5pm on Saturday) they open the door and allow first come, first served to sit at the bar with full menu

We had booked a table well in advance but on the day we felt it would be a waste of time going back to our accommodation before dinner so we called asked if we could be seated earlier, they said we could come and wait at the bar so we did. We came in and felt that the hostesses reception was frosty at best, possibly owing to the fact that we both look relatively young and were dressed casually. We were found a seat after a few moments which we we're appreciative of as we'd had a long day exploring and we're cold and tired. A large window above the table next to us was open and a cold breeze was blowing in, I asked a waiter if he wouldn't mind shutting it as I was very cold. He went and spoke to the hostess who came over and said in a rude tone 'they (meaning the other customers) don't want to shut the window but you can move to the table behind' I was taken aback by her attitude but happily moved away from the draft. I later noticed the customers by the window struggling to shut it themselves due to cigarette smoke blowing in, no help was offered. Having moved, I was reading through the menu and looked up to overhear the hostess point at our previous table and say to a waiter, loudly enough for me to hear, 'she had an issue with the window so that table now needs to be re set' I was appalled at how unprofessional she was and felt very uncomfortable. I didn't think it was a big deal as we had only just sat down. Had we not been so tired we would have left then and there. Throughout the meal one waiter repeatedly bashed into the back of my chair making it feel like I was sitting in the way. The waitress that served us was very nice and tried her best to make sure we had a nice meal. The food it's self was nothing special, the filo parcels tasted fine but were sparsely stuffed and came without any sauce to accompany the dish, the lamb chops themselves were nice but again came with just 3 potato wedges and no sauce. My partners moussaka tasted very nice but was dry. Overall the food was ok, but the meal was ruined by a terribly rude and pretentious hostess who created a horrible atmosphere. They obviously have no trouble filling the place so don't care if customers enjoy there experience.

I went to Kokkari Estiatorio on the basis of a blog by one of the chefs from Masterchef Australia and am happy to say I was not disappointed. The food we had was delicious and the service was incredibly good. The venue is very beautiful and easy to locate. My only criticism is that it is a little but noisy when they are full but this would not stop me from returning. Definitely need to make a booking though as we went on a monday night and it was packed!

I have tried so many times to get a reservation at Kokkari and finally did. Why oh why did I wait so long? It was special from the moment we walked in with very attentive staff. We walked past the roasting pork and chickens not he spits that had the most amazing aroma. We wanted to try a little of everything and pretty much did between the 5 of us and our fabulous waiter helped us choose the perfect dishes with a smile and professionlism. We started with martinis and cocktails that were generous-I hate skimpy cocktails when I'm out to dinner, ruins the meal I think. I have to say for the entire table the standout for the night was the Octapodaki tou Yiorgou. We have never had octopus cooked this perfectly anywhere ever. It just melted with flavor and texture that should make any other restaurant jealous. The lamb meatballs were flavorful and delicious as were the roasted beets, Spanakotiropita and the wonderfully crispy little smelt. The roasted pork from the spit was a total hit for the table-tender, juicy, well seasoned, what more do you need? We also tried the lamb shank that was perfect (everyone kept telling us before we went that Kokkari has the BEST lamb and they were right!), and a whole roasted fish that was cooked so well. I could not believe it but we all got a dessert to finish the evening-the puffy Greek donuts, the decadent Baklava, the melty Sokolatina flourless chocolate cake and the giant Kokkari sundae and the peach and ouzo sorbet. Of course the dessert wines were perfectly paired for us. Can't wait to go back. We all voted this one of the best meals we have had in a long time.

I finally got a reservation to this place (attempted several times before but always no availability). We ordered smelt and the sausage (one of the specials of the day) for appetizers, and the octopus salad and lamb chops for entrees. I enjoyed the lemony flavor of the smelt. Sausage was tasty and blended well with the yogurt. Octopus was tender. Lamb chops were cooked to my liking. Overall, food was ok but nothing in particular that I would crave to go back for. Our main waiter was friendly and attentive, but others on the wait/serve staff looked like they did not want to be there (almost scowling). Perhaps it was because there was no A/C on. We were seated in a booth just beside big windows that were open, but I can't imagine how it must have been working in one of the hottest days in SF.

Kokkari is a fabulous restaurant. They offer a gamut of delights ranging from a wide variety of appetizers ((which can make a meal) to hunks of meat straight from an open spit.

My daughter and I dined here for lunch last week. It was a surprise from my daughter as she knows how much I like this restaurant. This was my fourth visit ever, but first time for lunch. Again, no disappointment here! Our waitress, Monique, was cordial, fun, efficient, and excellent all around. The food was superb, as always. We had reservations, an absolute must. Otherwise, there isn't a chance you will be seated! And reservations need to be made sometime in advance. My daughter made the reservations a week before, and she got one of the last two lunch times available. I think I like sitting in the restaurant portion that is in the bar area best. More ambiance, a great fire, and a bit quieter. However, in the other room, you get to watch the chefs in action. Either way, it is great.We each ordered a glass of Malbec (fabulous - and one of the less costly wines by the glass), we split two appetizers, and split one lamb kebab. I could have licked the plates clean! As I mentioned in an earlier review, there is a reason this restaurant is number one: food, service, ambiance, location. This restaurant has everything that makes it stand out as one of the best. I'll be back!!!

Restaurants are for food (well, mostly, I guess...), so the quality of food must guide the rating, though other aspects may be grating. Here, the food is mostly very well prepared, though rather exorbitantly priced. If the cost is irrelevant, or the occasion special, and you love Greek food, then make your reservation (walk-ins are unwelcome). Branzino, lamb chops, mousaka, all claim one's palate. The clientele clearly disregards cost, so ply, or fly... and try elsewhere.

I was treated to Kokkari at a business meeting, where our host did all the ordering and everything was great. When I was back a few months later my wife and I stopped by for lunch. Was not disappointed. We had the dolmades appetizer, then I had chicken souvlaki and my wife a lamb burger for lunch. OK, not very adventurous, but all were great. It's tought o get a reservation but it is worth it.

ALMOST five stars...minus one for a couple slip ups in service...

Was REALLY looking forward to trying this place. Called ahead for reservations, and the lady who took our reservations seemed both rushed and irritated when I called to make the reservations. When she called back the day before to confirm, she was very short and again, borderline irritated. It made me nervous to make the trip here to celebrate my hubby's birthday, but we hoped the service would be a little friendlier when we arrived. Thankfully, it was.Our server was very friendly, although not very efficient in a couple different aspects. He forgot a few of our items, and the tables on both sides of us (who arrived after us) received their appetizers and drinks ahead of us, and at one point, had to wait about 10 minutes to flag down our server for another drink. Other than that, the food was phenomenal and the restaurant was beautiful...service could have been just a bit more buttoned up, but I can see why this is one of the top rated restaurants in San Francisco. 

A must try!

We sat at the bar--and went just before 6:00 on a Sunday night--it became very busy--and with good reason, it was excellent. Our bartender sent my wife's order back (kabobs) and it came back perfectly. I went to try the leg on the open flame--and did not get the taste I was looking for--but you'll find unique items on the menu, and the service at the bar was outstanding. OK, we spent over $200, but we didn't regret it--it's one of those places you were glad to get into.

We have been going to Kokkari over many years. The restaurant has a very nice ambience, with it's mix of formal furnishings and rustic fireplaces, busy bar and cozy tables. It's a place that accommodates couples wanting a date night, families having a celebration and business diners. The food has been "solid" traditional Greek dishes, with good flavors. Their grilled meats are a speciality. However, our most recent visit was a disappointment because the food was not well seasoned. I'm not sure if they had an "off" night, have changed chefs, or this reflects a change in our tastes.

My husband and I have eaten at Kokkari several times and have always enjoyed the delicious food, great service, and charming atmosphere. Dinner with friends included a variety of appetizers and entrees, all of which were outstanding. Lunch at the bar with the Greek salad of cucumbers, tomatoes and feta cheese is more than enough for a meal with their mouth watering flatbread

I have been there numerous times, different occasions. No matter if with your date, for a business dinner or simply with your friends this is a fabulous place to eat. The atmosphere is elegant yet cozy. Wine and food are first class. Service impeccable. I can only recommend it. But be sure to make reservations far in advance.

Just too noisy

The food was above average, but the noise level was high. That's true of many restaurants today and architects should consider using 'softer' materials to absorb the noise. This restaurant is pricey and you can't hear what someone is saying at the other end of the table: we were five people. Obviously, noise doesn't bother some people, but then there are many people like me

San Francisco is full of excellent restaurants. Kokkari is simply one of the finest restaurants in the city. There is no better place for lamb. Their dishes are unique. The ambiance is wonderful. If you are only visiting the city once you will not be disappointed. If you are a city dweller, this will become one of your regulars. Opa!

Been there a couple of times now. Would definitely recommend the branzino entree. Also went there for a work dinner once - the food as always was excellent, although the service was a little slow

Very pretty decor, warm and traditional, elegant dress code. The food is amazing: zucchini cakes simply fantastic, grilled octopus very tasty, but no capers sauce; pork& lamb sausage with feta was something special. Really one of the best dinner I had in my life. Waiters are perfect and everything make your night there unforgettable. 

Wonderful goat stew!

O.K., so Kokkari is known for its lamb, and we did order the lamb chops as one of the items to share, but we were really glad that we also ordered the goat stew that was a special the day we visited, and recommended by our server. It was totally delicious! Don't miss the Karpouzi me Feta (watermelon salad with Feta cheese) if it's offered. We were a little disappointed by dessert, wish we had ordered the rice pudding.The wine list is more than adequate, and the service excellent. Ask to sit in the rear dining room (the one that looks into the open kitchen) because it seems a little quieter than the front dining room and the one in between the two. The restaurant is an easy walk from Embarcadero BART, or there is valet parking. I will be introducing friends to this restaurant soon, and highly recommend you try it!

Pretty good

The worst thing about the restaurant is that it is noisy and crowded. But it is fun to people watch and everybody, including our fellow diners, were friendly. You get the feeling that people love to dine at this restaurant. The service is excellent, given the crowds. I ordered the Avgolemono soup, which didn't have the snappy fresh lemon taste that I expected and was thus somewhat disappointing. The salad, however, was very good. I tasted my husband's lamb chop and it was also very good. Beware of the Kokkari Sundae. It is huge. We should have ordered just that one dessert and shared it.

Sat at the bar and talked with the locals and the staff most of whom had worked for up to 18 years at Kokkari Took the bartenders remarkable recommendationsfor lamb on the spit in the dining room and beautifully charred octopus. Everything seems to have just a few simple perfect ingredients The rice pudding might make one weep for their nonna

Went for lunch on a friend's recommendation. Wow now I will trust his food judgment forever. Must have reservations for all times. Great bar. Great wine list. Great bread and biutteR- no really. We ordered all of the special appetizer plates. Half Moon Bay sea urchin, fresh peaches, fresh corn and lamb riblets. Always get the lamb riblets-incredible. Dolmas with lamb also worth ordering all the time. Baked spanikopita was very good. Absolutely excellent eatery!

I went to Kokkari for my birthday while visiting SF and the meal was excellent as was the service was superb.We had a special dolmas grilled calamari and lamb chops. The appetizers were especially good. The dessert and wine were also great. We had their cab by the glass, dessert for me was a flourless chocolate torte. Not too sweet 

I must come back

I tried to make a reservation over the phone, for the same day, and I was suggested just to drop by. Hence I was going under the impression that the place was not really a favorite. But the night was rainy and I didn't want to be trying and failing in other places, so anyways I went.What a surprise I got when it was almost impossible to walk in. I was asked to look and wait for a spot in the bar. Eventually I got my place. In speaking with the bartender, he suggested to go with the special, and he pointed out for the huge open fire hearth, where some ducks were been roasted. I asked for it. IN the mean time, and since it was a cold rainy February night , I asked for the avgolemono. It was delicious, but when the roasted duck showed up, anything else was almost irrelevant. That was the perfection of the rusticness. Haven't stopped talking about it to friends ever since.

THIS PLACE! My foodie friends and I tried this Greek resto in the city to finally experience what people are raving about this place. From the appetizers all the way to the dessert, all of us were impressed! Here are our recommendations : Appetizers- Pork Belly, Watermelon with feta, Pita bread with spreads; Entrees- Lamb Shank, Rotisserie meat of the day, Bass, Roasted Chicken ; Dessert - Baklava, Custard in filo, Loukoumades. Love the interior as well! To top it all, service was really great! Fast and very helpful with suggestions! Kokkari is definitely in my Top 5 favorite restaurants in the US!

We dined there the first night of our trip and loved it. We had the grilled vegetable and sausage (one of the specials that day) appetizer - sausage was great. We had the whole (deboned made it easy) grilled fish and the grilled chicken. Both were delicious. Unfortunately we were too full for dessert. If this place was in Texas, it would be on our regular rotation. Highly recommend it. 

Very good food

We visited this restaurant with my 9 year old daughter. Be prepared as this is an upmarket venue. Best to dress well and be prepared to splash out as it is generally worth it. We ordered the stuffed calamari which I think was Ok but not great. The courgette fritters were are a little greasy but certainly tasty. The meatballs were excellent. My wife lamb shank was tasty if a little overpowered by cinnamon. My lamb souvlaki was very tasty. Our waiter was very helpful if a bit distracted initially as we were served our starters without any wine (in any top restaurant this is a no no!). Overall a pleasant experience and one worth a visit. Good wine list!.

Definitely worth visiting

This was a really nice evening - the restaurant is very grand, terrific wine list, delicious Greek food, and outstanding service. The grilled octopus mezethe was fantastic - one could easily just have several mezethes but that would mean missing out on the equally delicious entrees.

Outstanding, albeit pricey lunch. The crowd was a mix of tourists and power business lunch types. We particularly liked the Spanakopita (best I have ever had), Melitzanosalata, and the Meatball appetizers. The Chicken Souvlaki was also excellent, but the Ravioli were a bit heavy. If we go back, I'd probably lean more on appetizers, just because the ones that we had were so good.The menu is online; suffice to say that Kokkari is expensive (though not exceptionally so for a good SF restaurant). Overall, I would recommend it.

Long anticipated visit to Kokkari Great looking restaurant. Much larger than expected. Seated at a table nearly in the lap of the party at the other table so not much space.Service good. I had lamb riblets and a fish course. Just not as tasty as expected. Didn't even finish. The riblets were greasy but tender. The fish was mostly bones. Maybe just picked the wrong entrees.Too bad
