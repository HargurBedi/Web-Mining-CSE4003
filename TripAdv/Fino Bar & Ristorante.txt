My wife and I stopped here for dinner in a Friday night. We found the food quality to be excellent. It is a busy but smaller restaurant so we would highly recommend making a reservation if you want a table on the weekend. We were fortunate in our timing but many people were turned away (you have to call them for a reservation, they don't take them online). My wife had a gluten free pasta and the sauce was fantastic. Fresh ingredients and amazing smokey pancetta. The seafood and pasta options are vast and excellent. Overall this place is worth a visit. Dress is casual and comfortable. Would make a nice special event dinner too. The staff are very friendly and attentive.

Managed to get seated at the bar for dinner without a reservation (which is probably needed), which wasn't our first choice but turned out to be great! Really lovely, homely atmosphere. Perfect balance of casual atmosphere with just the right amount of sophistication! Ordered the gorgonzola gnocchi which was excellent. Beautiful bread and balsamic dip which is provided for free! Great service too! Highly recommend

For our last night in san Francisco, we had wanted Italian food, but didn't feel like going too far from union Square. We decided on Fino, and are very happy that we did. This was the best Italian food that we have had since being in Italy last year. The salads were superb, as were the pasta dishes. I had the pasta with broccoli rabe, and is was outstanding. The wine list is very good, as are the desserts. We will be back here the next time we are in San Francisco.

Fino is one of the better Italian restaurants in San Francisco as the menu includes a wide variety of high quality dishes that are sure to please just about every pallet and taste. I've had the veal parm and gnocchi gorgonzola in my two visits as well as apps and dessert, everything was splendid and at a very reasonable price.The only reason I wouldn't rate Fino as a five star is that the service level is average. The hostess on this last dinner was rude and it was also difficult to confirm a reservation. Otherwise, this is still a nice restaurant to visit and I would recommend it to anyone seeing a reasonably priced Italian dinner in downtown San Francisco.

It's beautiful place, and the service is smooth, although a bit rushed. I've been here before and it was great. Maybe I hit an off-night this time, but unless you're on a salt-free diet, you'll need to ask for salt (not provided), because there's little in the sauces. And it was disappointing that the house-made pasta was somewhat overcooked and mushy.To top it off, as tables were vacated after 9:00, they were stripped of tablecloths and left bare and abandoned, candles out. At an elegant restaurant like this, every table should be re-set, even if they don't expect to need it again and will have to strip it again later. It only takes one minute. Maybe it was a single inattentive employee, but where was the manager between 9 and 10 on September 6? Regrettably, this was not the same experience I had a year or two ago.

Fino's. 
Rating: 4
Date: August 29, 2017
First review I've ever done. Ever. And really have no idea why I'm motivated to do it now as Fino's is a restaurant that tries very hard. And effort is most of success, right?So they get right the service. Absolutely no complaints there. And I feel somewhat conflicted writing something even remotely critical because the people working there are professional, driven, and know what they're doing. I sat at the bar after the dude at the front made room for me between two other couples who didn't seem to like that some guy with broad shoulders was going to be siting between them. And I get that too. But the dude at the front made room with no apologies. And I respect that directness. But. And there's always a but, right? I had the linguine with scallops and "prawns." These were shrimp not prawns. But who cares as they were cooked and seasoned very well. As were the scallops. Perfectly cooked, crisped and browned and then unctuously smooth. Those were the highlights though. The linguine, while cooked as it should, was utterly without flavor. No salt was in the boiling water. The greens that they added as a garnish were also not seasoned. I get the placing raw greens on a steaming pile of pasta to wilt with the heat. But shouldn't they have some flavor? Likewise the broth that was added. Weak. Some red pepper cooked with EVOO and drizzled over the top would've provided some needed connectivity. Now this might seem as quibbling and you might be right. But the couple beside me asked for salt. And went to town shaking it over their food like a dance party was in town. So I don't think I'm entirely off the mark here. And frankly the whole gimmick of asking whether you'd like fresh cracked pepper added after the plate is in front of you is at best a marketing ploy and at worst an admission your food isn't seasoned right. Anyway, enough of the rant, somewhat. I think you'll enjoy Finos. And I haven't had the other offerings. So take this review with a grain of salt.

The chefs were generous with their vegetables and anchovies. My partner had the margharita pizza which he also loved. We ended it off with the cheesecake which was lovely but way too big. We had the Reisling to accompany our meal and didn't regret it. Our waiter was attentive and lovely. Overall an amazing experience.

We have to add our 5 star rating to this lovely restaurant. Everything was excellent from the ambiance to the waitstaff to the food and the wine! We had the mussels to start and were blown away by both the quantity and quality. We asked the waiter to recommend a good local (i.e. Napa or Sonoma) wine, which he did, and it was terrific. I ordered the scallops and they were done to perfection - no easy feat with scallops; there is a very small window between underdone and overdone with scallops, but they managed to nail it. They pulled an excellent espresso after dinner as well, although it was definitely an Italian-style espresso. Although it was a bit on the spendy side, it was worth it. (Pasta dishes are lower priced, but I didn't want all that carb/wheat.) Reservations are a must (we had tried the evening before, but no luck).

Last night of a two week tour of California - where service has been absolutely at the epicentre of every restaurant I've been. I read good reviews about Fino and opted to take my wife there for dinner, phoning ahead was told the current wait time was 15-25 minutes. On arrival (10 minutes later) it had escalated to 45-50minutes. I said we'd love to have a drink at the bar and wait there but it was not an option, the greeter then laughed at me and stated that's just how it is. Disaster. You can't book ahead but there is no efficient system for walk-ins, it's basically a lottery. Worst treatment of entire holiday.

My wife's special scallops was average..good scallops drowned in a pretty average sauce.The service also wasn't great. The captain was good, the waiter was a bit miserable and unhelpful. We found San Fran a mixed bag in this area.Might go there again, wouldnt be bothered if i didnt.

Fino is located inside the Alexander Hotel on the side of one of San Francisco's famed hills. If you walk in through the street entrance, you must descend a steep flight of stairs. Enter through the hotel lobby and there are no stairs required. The restaurant is small and the floors are not quite level. That put me off at first, until the proprietor explained this was the only building on the block to survive the 1906 earthquake! What character! Want more history? The Obama family dined here when they visited San Francisco. Everything else at Fino is five star fun. The finest service we had in the city, an incredible menu. Attention to detail like chilled salad forks. Their seafood dishes wowed me. I had the largest, most succulent scallops and shrimp ever! The linguini bolognese had the meatiest meat sauce I ever had in a restaurant! Here's a tip: split the salad course. We shared a salad and had more than enough for two. The tiramisu dessert was big enough to split for four!Top appetizer: Fried calamari. I cannot say enough fine things about Fino!

Went there on the recommendation of our bar back at our hotel. The minestrone soup was honestly some of the best I've had. Wife loved the bread at the beginning of the meal. I love places that don't provide salt-and-pepper at the table. I could tell right away they were confident in their product. I kind of get the feeling that they would prefer a higher end clientele. We were completely underdressed as well as most of their customers. It was extremely expensive but entirely worth it. If we had known we honestly wouldn't have gone. The entire wait staff were professional, patient, and kind. We honestly loved this place. Would highly recommend it if you've got the $100 plus to spend on dinner for two.

We went in on a Saturday night at 8 with no reservation and were told the wait would be about 45 mins which is fair, but they have a lobby to wait in and they will bring you a drink menu and drinks while you wait. They ended up having an opening for 2 less than 5 minutes later. The service was average, nothing wring, nothing special. They bring complimentary bread and a delicious olive oil & vinegar concoction. We ordered and the food came out really quickly, topped with fresh Parmesan off the block. the food was delicious and authentic. A tad salty for my taste, but that is to be expected. But overall really delicious! My favorite was the pesto sauce. The portions were generous, I was forcing the last bit down because it was just so good haha. That left no room for dessert, but the dessert that we saw others around us ordering looked divine. Overall I recommend this little spot! Especially for a date or special occasion!

Went last night and had an enjoyable evening. There are a few things that let this place down a little. We had calamari to start, huge portion shared between two easy. But served with an odd tomato sauce, never had this in any Italian visited before and it didn't really work. I had pizza, which was good. Dad had ravioli which was good but swamped in way too much sauce which took away from the pasta somewhat. Drinks are expensive and the cocktails weren't great. Our waiter also had a bit of attitude and although polite enough seemed to get overly annoyed at requests for normal things such as extra parmasan grated on top of dads pasta. Please my enough but no way near the best Italian I've had.

Let's just say the night could've been better. We arrived for a 730 reservation and we were asked to wait in the lobby of the adjacent hotel until our table was ready. We asked to have a glass of wine while we waited at the bar where open seats were available. We were told those seats were reserved for patrons having dinner at the bar only.10 minutes later, we were seated in a very cramped end booth. The adjacent table with 6 inches away. We were literally eating off of one another's tables. Clearly not what I envisioned for anniversary dinner Ask the host for a different table perhaps with a more romantic and private setting, Was told none were available.Five minutes later, a walk in couple without reservations got seated at an open table.Overall, the dinner was good but a bit pricey for what you get. Avoid the calamari. Tasteless. Caesar salad was better than average.In summary , the host needs to be replaced. So much of a dining experience is based upon service and friendliness.Our waiter seemed rushed and non accommodating to go over the menu or specials of the day . Sorry to say,this highly anticipated anniversary dinner turned out sub optimal. A few Similar reviews have been posted on trip advisor. Although it does appear to be hit and miss. Perhaps we were on the Miss side tonight

Found this restaurant under 'nearby' through TripAdvisor. Absolute gem and thanks to all that have reviewed before. Great menu and wine list. You will not be disappointed. Not to expensive and excellent service. 

Superb!!

Just ate here 2 nights in a row and booked again for tomorrow, our last night in Santorini.A local recommended this restaurant and I'm so grateful that she did. Food and service is outstanding, tonight we even received a complimentary dessert, and of course, even that was to die for, just delicious.I cannot recommend this restaurant enough and feel unbelievably smug walking back to my hotel watching other tourists "not in the know" consuming tourist 'quality' rubbish on the tourist mile. Go there, you won't be disappointed. 

Exquisite!

Trip advisor didn't fail us with this place! Visited last night without a reservation but were accommodated by the excellent and efficient staff. The food was faultless. Possibly the finest Italian dining we've experienced to date. 

Cozy atmosphere, good food, price for dinner is $$$

It was a very nice and family-like atmosphere to celebrate a birthday. the Host is in need of customer service skills. It seems as though because a reservation is recommended, he can speak to you however he wants to; not friendly. Our waiter was friendly and made up for the host. Other patrons were friendly as well. We enjoyed our dinner but would rather go to a different Italian restaurant next time. Prices seemed a little high for the dinner we received.

Fun and Friendly Fino

My husband found this restaurant close to our hotel (on Trip Adviser), so we went for dinner our second night in SF. What a wonderful meal! We started with an arugula salad, then I had shrimp and scallop pasta, my husband had veal parmesean. My shrimp, scallops, and spinach were served with linguine in a light white wine sauce -- I ate it all. The server suggested a great white wine. My husband said his entree was great -- not overwhelmed by the cheese(which happens sometimes with this dish) -- and a good Chianti. We were too full for dessert, but some of choices we saw others enjoying were lovely. Service was attentive and timely. Lots of folks without reservations had to wait, so it's good to call ahead.

Treat yourself to a piece of heaven

We spent the night in SanFrancisco after a medical appointment. Using Trip Advisor, we found this gem just a block from our hotel. First let me say that the service was amazing, both at the bar and in the dining room. When we thought the service couldn't be improved upon, we tasted the food... any expectation we had was FAR surpassed. We had a very enjoyable dinner at very reasonable prices for the area. We will CERTAINLY return. 

Nice surprise

I frequently stay in the Andrews Hotel where Fino opens into the lobby. The restaurant has become my home away kitchen. The staff is warm and attentive and typically pours my beverage of choice the minute they see my face. This level of personalized service is great for business travelers who frequently eat alone. There are approximately six stools at the bar where dinner can be served. The tables in the dining room can be close together. But they always have crisp white linens. The tables in the front of the restaurant look out onto Post and the rear dining room is more interior. A lovely table is the 2 or 4 person tables by the picture window looking out onto post.Every pasta dish that I've ordered has been delicious but my "go to" order is the arugula salad with grilled chicken, pear, pecans, and Gorgonzola. It is a light but satisfying dinner. The restaurant fills up around 7 to 7:30 so if you are planning on dining around that time or later you might want to consider making reservations. 

So lucky to have stumbled across this place :)

First time here and we'll go back again and again. We walked in without a reservation and were so lucky to be seated immediately, which I gather is usually not the case. They told us it wasn't a busy night (Sunday) but people were turned away after awhile because of the wait. Highly recommend making a reservation. We had a chef's special, sea bass that was amazing, served with ricotta ravioli. Great wine selection and the service was excellent.

Very nice

Found this little place on TripAdvisor and it didn't disappoint, fabulous food (had ravioli and margarita pizza, plus two great desserts) and atmosphere. Only thing that let it down a little was the host, they really don't have the personality to be greeting and seating people, even on the phone they had a disinterested tone, however the wait staff themselves were great! 

Great food, warm atmosphere and fabulous staff!

Staff are so friendly and attentive here, always making sure we were happy. The food was really delicious, authentic and full of flavour. We had the bruschetta, Veal bolognese pasta and "Luisa" pizza, all of which were very enjoyable -highlight being the amazingly rich dark chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean icecream, berries, lightly whipped cream and a crunchy toffee lace garnish (YUM!) Prices are reasonable and will definitely return!

Great location, uneven food

The service is very attentive. Our waiter made a very good wine recommendation. My date's fish - a branzino - was good. However, my pasta Bolognese was too much pasta, tasteless meet, and not enough vegetables. A disappointment as this dish can be so, so very flavorful with simple tomato, carrots, onions, and other pan seared veggies.

Good traditional Italian food

I came here early one night since it was right around the corner from my hotel. They sat me instantly and the service was very friendly and welcoming. Not to mention the food was outstanding. I had this lavender gin cocktail that was to die for, a caprese salad and the scallops on special. Everything was melt in your mouth good. Very very happy TripAdvisor lead me here!

My boyfriend and I went to dinner last week. When we arrived it Was almost full (5.30pm) . We ordered a delicious wine Paso Robles , pasta and spinach salad. Everything delicious. You have a little appetizer free (pan with olive oil). The staff was super friendly with us. I really recommend this place if you are looking for a good Italian restaurant in SF.

We stayed at the Andrews Hotel and were pleasantly surprised to find this small quaint Italian restaurant was a part of it. We haven't had real Italian food this good since being in Italy. 5:00 complimentary wine each afternoon and an original menu with absolutely fabulous staff.

Loved this absolute gem of a restaurant!

My colleague and I arrived at this restaurant after 7pm on a Saturday night after a 12 hour flight with no reservation and they were so accommodating. The food was absolutely gorgeous, the service was wonderful. I couldn't fault this restaurant at all and it was only a shame that I did not get to return. I'll definitely be looking up this restaurant the next time I travel.

A delightful return

We had to return. This resto offers much in total enjoyment.We ordered an antipasto plate not on the menu. That was impressive in itself. I had the chix piccata which was tasty.Jose was attentive in a full house.I like the intimacy, offerings, and value.

Fine dining at Fino - but it's US style Italian food
Rating: 4
Date: May 7, 2017
First to realize is that Fino is to be entered through the lobby of the St. Andrews hotel, signs outside are a bit misleading here. Two small rooms with plenty of tables make for a great, if somewhat louder atmosphere. The bar also tends to be busy with solitary diners, clearly the place is busy and you better reserve upfront. Food was very well prepared and Italian style. Which means that you will get cheese ravioli with the fish of the day - the combination was actually quite delicious with a creamy sauce and lots of vegetables and crispy bacon. But a bit of a far cry from traditional Italian cooking. Not to complain, just a different fare. Service was young, attentative and helpful. Recommended though it is expensive

We called in here for dinner. We had to wait a few minutes for a table as we had no booking and they were busy. We were then seated and ordered our meals. They came out quickly. Meals were very nice and it was reasonably priced.
