Busy, sophisticated place for a special night out in San Fransisco. Family, Friends or a Date will enjoy this place. The menu is not extensive but it doesn't have to be because every thing is great. Enjoy specialty cocktails or a fine bottle of wine. We had a great waiter who was a nice balance of fun and friendly with professional service. Finally there is a jazz quartet that is playing and they add the perfect background music to a perfect night. Enjoy it.

Corkage fee??

Really used to love going here because the food was reliable and they didn't charge an exorbitant fee to bring in a favorite bottle of wine into the restaurant. Now this has changed and they are charging a large fee. The associated Rutherford Grill out in Rutherford has not started charging a fee so I suggest you go there if you need a Hillstone experience.

Visited Hillstone before our Alcatour. We sat at the bar and our bartender Oliver was amazing! He made us delicious cocktails and was very personable. 3 of us shared the Spinach and Artichoke dip, which is larger then it looks. It is a bit on the spendy side but absolutely worth every penny!

Solid good food. Generous portions. Well made cocktails and nice wine list. I had my "go to" spareribs that fall off the bone with French fries and coleslaw. Enough to take home for next days left overs. Good service, great location except the parking is a challenge. I used the local lot ($20) and had to park on the 4th floor with no elevator. Best to take a cab or Uber. Would definitely recommend.

Our concierge recommended that we have lunch near Pier 33 before our Alcatraz tour. The food and service was very good. I had the French dip and my wife had the chicken tenders. I would highly recommend either one! The only drawback is that they are a little pricey!

We had some out of town guests visiting SF and decided to bring them to Hillstone in the city. We regularly frequent their sister restaurant Los Altos Grill in the Mid-Peninsula which we absolutely love. Hillstone SF has a very similar decor with lots of comfy booth seating. It has the added benefit of being located right along the Embacadero with some nice views of the bay side. For starters, we tried the Artichoke and Spinach Dip (since they were out of Grilled Artichoke). It was nice, but not nearly as good as the Grilled Artichokes we've had at the Los Altos Grill. For entrees, we tried the Bone-in Prime Rib, Rotisserie Chicken, Emerald Kale and Chicken Salad, and Famous French Dip. The Prime Rib is a hefty cut, so either share it or be very very hungry. Rotisserie Chicken is a good choice, but somewhat plain and simple and not especially outstanding. The French Dip was good with the tasty and tender prime rib meat, but the bun here was not as nicely toasted as it is usually served at Los Altos Grill. I liked the Emerald Kale and Chicken Salad with the light peanut vinaigrette -- very fresh, clean flavors. To finish, we shared the Key Lime Pie, which is a seasonal dessert at the Hillstone restaurants, but it's probably one of the best key lime pies anywhere with just the right balance of sweet and tart, and a delicious pecan nut crust. We liked the free corkage on the first bottle of wine you bring (again consistent with other Hillstone restaurants), but they also have a good selection of wines on their menu. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner here, but still much prefer the food at our regular Los Altos Grill where their menu boasts quite a few favorites that are not available at Hillstone SF, including the Skillet Cornbread, Deviled Eggs, Macho Chicken Salad, Ahi Salad, BBQ Rib & Chicken Combo, and more.

Hillstone is a best-in-class American bistro with a combination of casual-elegance and outstanding food and service. Our dinner was superb from start to finish, beginning with the wine, live music and starters. Savory chicken, best cooked red cabbage every, and my son's ribs reminded us of some of the best we've ever had in Texas. Service was impeccable.

Walking along the Embarcadero, we came across Hillstone, opposite Pier 33 and decided to have dinner there. We started out with a cocktail at the bar whilst we waited for our table.We received the kind of upbeat, professional and attentive service American restaurants are known for. We ordered: spinach and artichoke dip to start, the the jumbo lump crab cakes and the cajun trout. Everything was fresh and delicious. The restaurant had a pleasantly vibrant ambience that rounded off our day nicely.

I can't count on both hands how many times I have eaten at Hillstones. It used to be called Houston's but the menu is basically the same. It's an upscale chain that I always thought of as my place to go for a steak.I met friends on the Embarcadaro in San Francisco and couldn't wait to go to Hillstones for a good steak. Of course I would never come here with out ordering the grilled artichokes and spinach artichoke dip. They are the best you will find anywhere. We usually order a strip steak that is not on the menu but the secret is out and they sold out already by 7pm. Let me back up to the wait 1.5 hours. She told me 45 minutes on arrival when I checked at the hour mark she rudely told me it was that I was told it was an hour. We had out appetizers at the bar and we were happy but don't be rude when I spent $80 for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers at the bar. Yes it's my chose to come here and I know what it cost.We ordered the tradituonal salad filet and a baked potato. I ordered a side of red braised cabbage. I could eat this salad every day with buttermilk garlic dressing. The potato was perfect with a little sweetness to it. How do they do that. The cabbage was worth every penny. The steak was ok but I won't order it again. Why not put the popular strip steak back on the menu.After waiting 1.5 hours the service was terrible. A beautiful smiling friendly waitress only seemed to be around being what I felt was phony concern when you didn't need her. I did complain to the manager and he comped our desserts. But so.e how it didn't seem enough. I felt like I had been jipped by this place I love so much. I absolutely will be back. I will sit at the bar where they gave excellent service and where I was happy to over tip for the attention. I will have the artichoke cabbage salad and see if they have the strip steak. Of not I will go with chicken or a burger.

I had a meeting in the area around lunchtime and when I mapped out my route, I saw a notation for Hillstone (Houston's to me--thanks for avoiding the calorie count) on Google Maps. When I lived in the NYC area, I was a frequent visitor to Houston's (both locations) with friends. Plus, it was my go-to spot for out-of-town relatives. A "must have" was the spinach dip. No other iterations come close. My sister (a great home cook) even failed at trying to replicate the recipe. Second was the "fall of the bones" ribs. As my appointment approached, I was more excited about eating at Houston's afterwards (after a 10-year hiatus).As I had remembered, the spinach dip was superb! To save room for the other items I wanted to order, I left a little of the spinach dip and its accoutrements to the side to take home. When the efficient wait staff wanted to remove the plate, I had to chastise them to leave it. Next, were the ribs. They seemed a little bigger than the "baby back" ribs I remembered. Nevertheless, they still fell of the bones and where flavorful and tender. I saved a few bones to take home for another meal. As usual, I loved the fries; however, the coleslaw was a little too tangy. I sometimes ordered one of the salad options; however, the current choices seemed unfamiliar.My last item was dessert. I forgot what I used to order; however, I opted for the sundae over the brownie. I probably would've preferred the latter. Although it's not evident upon sight, sometimes ice cream can be prong to icy spots/globs, etc. (i.e., imperfections), which detract from the overall mouth feel. Although I didn't complain, this imperfection prevented me from truly enjoying the sundae.A three-course lunch is a little pricey; therefore, I have to save future visits for special occasions or just come in for spinach dip at the bar (worthy of a special trip from San Mateo)!

We picked this restaurant for lunch because it is the closest sit-down restaurant to Pier 33 for our cruise to Alcatraz. Location was ideal. Food service was very good and attentive. Food quality was rather average. I had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the soup of the day, my companion had a hamburger. I had to return my soup, it was way too salty. My Chicken Sandwich was just okay. My companion found her hamburger a little too rare and not very flavorful. Neither of us finished our meals. For the price we paid, $19 for the Chicken Sandwich and $20 for the hamburger, I expected a better level of food. If you only care about having a meal before catching the ferry to Alcatraz, this is the place for you. If you want a good meal at a good price, this place is probably not for you.

Enjoyed another Sunday lunch...this time, ordered Thai Noodle Salad with roasted chicken. It can also be ordered with steak. Includes avocado, mango, peanuts, fresh herbs. I requested no extra spice, sometimes Thai is too spicy for me. This ample noodle dish is delicious. I think a top gourmet magazine has recently featured it too. The service and ambiance are wonderful. We didn't have reservations, got seated right away, though they do take reservations, but must be made at least 1 hour before. We walked from Embarcadero not too far from Pier 39.

Came in late from the Night Alcatraz Tour, and the Hillstone restaurant was just across the road. So we decided it would do..Had great service from the waitress and didn't have to wait long for the food.Servings were generous and we enjoyed our dishes.The restaurant is dark, with lots of booth seating. We didn't mind the former as it was quite a cozy place (even though a large restaurant) and we were a bit chilly from the boat ride from the Rock..

I have been a Houstons/Hillstone loyal customer since 1989 and over the past few years I've grown increasingly disappointed in the fact that their service standards have stated to slip. I have to say that this is NOT the case at the San Francisco location. I sat at the bar for lunch and the two gentlemen looking after the bar were absolutely incredible.The spinach appetizer (formerly known as simply "The Chicago") was fantastic as always as was the grilled chicken salad.I continue to be miffed that they discontinued the complimentary cheese toast that could be requested with the salad. It was so simple and made customers like me happy and now they act as though you've asked them for the world when you ask for it. Now they have a rosemary ciabatta they charge for. The one time I ordered it (at a different location) it was so salty it was inedible.Thanks to the Hillstone in SF for restoring my faith in this brand.

My wife and son and I did the Alcatraz tour and following that it was lunch time so we were looking for a restaurant. Hillstone is right across the street from Pier 33 so we went there for lunch. Excellent restaurant with professional staff. Very clean and for us anyway "upscale". Prices what you would expect in San Francisco but the food was excellent. We had the Salmon, Trout and ribeye steak and no complaints about any of them. We live in Europe and see more of professional servers than in the U.S. but Hillstone has professional servers (in my opinion). Place was crowded for mothers day and reservations are requested but they found a table for us. I would definitely recommend HIllstone.

We ate here while staying in San Francisco for the night on the recommendation of family members. We were able to get a reservation and got right in. We were seated very quickly, and our writers was very attentive. We ordered their world famous artichoke spinach dip. It is not the best I've ever had but it is very good. We also split a French dip sandwich was which was incredibly good.

My husband had a burger and chips and I had the rotisserie chicken with mash (just be aware that it comes with no veg) ordered a side of greens which appeared instantly. We both had desserts, a drink each and I had a coffee and it totalled $97 dollars. I thought it was reasonably priced and would definitely visit again if I was in the area.

Located across from Pier 33 where the Alcatraz tour sets sail, this is the perfect spot to have a hearty meal. We were in a bit of a rush having only an hour but the service and speed of food was excellent. I went for the vegetarian burger which was outstanding along with the side of slaw. Often the vegetarian options in restaurants can be bland and tasteless and this was not the case here. My partner had the grilled chicken salad and equally was very happy with the flavours and quality of the ingredients, particularly the peanut sauce. We would defiantly visit again. Slightly on the pricey side of the spectrum but worth the money given the food quality.

Very disappointed that we had a reservation but couldn't seem to get seated until an hour past our scheduled time. We even lost a few members of our group because it got so late and they were "over" it. The management was very nice and sent us complimentary appetizers in the bar, but to be honest, we didn't want to fill up on that and just wanted to order our dinner after a long day of travel. Once we finally were seated (an hour after our reservation time!), I must say the food was amazing! I had the French dip sandwich that may seem pretty simple, but this dinner melted in my mouth!! Not only stacks of buttery tender prime rib, but a tasty horseradish sauce and the bun seemed to dissolve as I chewed the ultimate deliciousness! (Which reminds me that what I tend to dislike the most about French dips is the hard crusty mounds of bread that just gets in the way of the yummy meat! NOT this one!) Yummy! Don't don't if I would put up with that ridiculous wait again, but would definitely go back at a less jay time for another one of those delightful sandwiches!

My husband and I really enjoy sitting at the bar for a Friday evening meal. We have been here many times with friends - always the choice when ribs are desired. I have had many items on the menu but my all time favorites are - The Grilled Artichoke to start - crispy grilled with garlic and olive oil is a delicious with a Martini. The Caesar salad with the Ribs is a perennial favorite meal. I have also enjoyed the Caesar with Crispy Shrimp as well as the fish specials. The wait staff is always friendly and your food is delivered as it is ready rather then waiting for your specific server which I appreciate in a busy place, which Hillstone's usually is. They now accept reservations but we are often a walk in and eat the the bar. It is located on the Embarcadero but there are SF natives as well as tourists.

The restaurant heating /cooling system blew a draught on to our friend's so made it cold. The fire didn't have much effect on the temperature with the cooling system on! Overall good experience but some improvements could make it even better.

We are regulars at Hillstone/Houston's in Houston, Texas. We brought international friends to Hillstone in San Francisco with high expectations given our many years of dining at Houston's. While the food was very good overall, we were a little disappointed that the French fries were not as fresh as we expect from a Hillstone restaurant. In addition, the serving size was smaller than normal. Given the price of the menu items, I expect better from Hillstone. In the end, our friends were pleased with their meal and they didn't know the difference in quality and quantity for this small item. I guess "everything is bigger in Texas". :-)

Party of five - good but at times peculiar (read outright comical) service. Food is solid but lacks an extra gear to bring it all the way up. Sampled the jumbo shrimp and salmon starters. The rib was OK....but lacked cooking excellence. The accompanying "fully loaded" potato was voluminous, tasty but lacked nuance. The deserts were big but also lacked finesse. OK wine selection. Reasonable prices.

I've loved French Dip sandwiches since childhood. Inevitably, they are usually disappointing these days, never quite matching the magical taste and texture of my childhood memories. At last, I am happy. The French Dip at Hillstone is fantastic. The house-made bread is divine, the prime rib tender and moist, and the au jus perfection. Also must give props to the Thai Steak and Noodle salad, also a divine dish.

First of all, San Francisco is a very expensive town. From what you pay for the meal, to what they add on for mandatory employee health care and assorted taxes. Our cruise ship was docked in port overnight and this restaurant was within easy walking distance, and we could meet up with some dear friends.They have a varying menu that anyone should be able to find something that their pallet will enjoy. Prices are mid range and nothing comes as complimentary. The service was very good and our entrees were prepared accordingly. We visited on a Monday night and it was extremely busy. I can only imagine how packed this place is on the weekend. We'd return

Anyone who has been to San Francisco knows about Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and the Embarcadero. Although there are lots of places to eat near these attractions, they are typically tourist spots which is why Hillstone is so wonderful. To be sure some tourists find their way to this restaurant, but by and large, it is a native San Franciscan location. The location, ambiance and food are all superb. It is definitely a good idea to make a reservation, especially for dinner during the weekend, but there is also a lovely, "seat yourself" bar area as an alternative. In addition, there is an outdoor seating area in the event there are too many people, it is too loud inside, or you just want a quiet drink or two.It doesn't matter if it is your first visit to San Francisco or you are a local, Hillstone is a lovely place to dine and entertain.

I've been coming to Hillstone for years, in fact I used to come here when this place was still called Houston's. The restaurant is part of a chain but whatever your idea about chain restaurants is I think Hillstone would surprise you. The food and the service are always outstanding and in the many years of eating here I never had a bad experience. Lately we've brought our kids with us for late lunches or early dinner and I think Hillstone qualifies as child friendly, especially for San Francisco. We always order the spinach and artichoke deep which is delicious. We like it so much that for a while we couldn't get ourselves to try another appetizer. Lately I've developed a fixation for the grilled artichokes which are very tasty. Over the years I've tried many of the entrees on the menu. French dip with fries is excellent, the burgers are the steaks are pretty good. They have a fairly decent wine list with many Napa choices, my favorite being the Zinfandel. The cocktails are also really good.On warm afternoons they open the patio, and it's nice to eat outside even though it's close to traffic. In the evening there's always a live band playing jazz which makes for a pleasant atmosphere. It's quite a bustling place, so don't go here for a romantic candlelight dinner. Also, if you plan to have dinner at Hillstone a reservation is advised. The place is always full at dinner time. The restaurant is about 5 minutes walk from Pier 39 along Embarcadero, so if you find yourself at Fisherman's Wharf, Hillstone is in within walking distance and has better food than you can find on the pier.Parking can sometimes be hard to find, especially at dinner time. But that shouldn't stop you from coming here.

We decided to try this place after finishing up Alcatraz tour-just across the street from ferry. Disappointed with the moscow mules not being served in the traditional copper mugs-but they were fair. Food was excellent however! Had the sea bass and it was cooked to perfection. Others in party had steak and ribs and they were all pleased. Had a great band and cozy fire going. Service seemed a bit disjointed and slow at times. Maybe be a better place to duck into for bar food or lunch.

We waited an hour, which we expected, and it was worth it. We grabbed martinis at the bar and sat outside. It was delicious. Live music. Great service. Dim lighting. Tiny, intimate booth. Make a reservation--you won't be disappointed.

Came for lunch for no other reason than it is opposite the Alcatraz pier.Service was good.Food was good.Restaurant looks nice.It filled up quickly and was jam packed at lunch, interestingly most seemed to be people on lunch rather than fellow tourists.A tad on the expensive side, $40 for ribs with fries.Recommended.

We went in to the restaurant after the night tour of alcatraz. Food was amazing, however the service was extremly rushed. My husband has finished his dinner and his plate was picked up before he had finished his fries and before i had finished my dinner which has never happened me before. We did not have dessert or coffee, we had half a bottle of wine left and the server continued to give us the bill. We felt rushed to drink up and go!

Not Up To Chain Standards

Unfortunately this location doesn't measure up to the standards in quality, food and service that the chain is up to. The service was floppy and the food wasn't as tasty as in other location. Hopefully it was just my luck and it was an off day. 

Early lunch

Date: September 4, 2016
We walked in without reservation about 12.30 on a Saturday morning & lucky enough as within the next 40 minutes it would have been impossible to get a table. We enjoyed a lovely lunch of cheese burger & chips and for me the healthy option of kale & roast chicken salad, which was healthy no fried or coated chicken. After we shared the most delightful brownie & vanilla. Definitely a desert to share. Cappuccino were served the way I love them with a mountain of froth. Staff were friendly & attentive. My only comment would be they cleared the table too quickly. Nice atmosphere, clean & nicely decorated. Well worth a visit if you're in the area.

Stopped in for a drink before dinner, at the old Houston's location on The Embarcadero. Quick service, good selection of gins and other spirits, though did not plumb the rum selection this time. A Junipero martini was $18 (yikes) though my wife got a well Greyhound up, it was $11, the grapefruit juice was fresh, and the portion was ample. So not so bad (for SF, that is). Embarcadero was crawling with 20-somethings, maybe since school is just starting? Hillstone was a sort of oasis from that. They have a patio area, too, small, we sat at the bar.

Stopped her for lunch on a day out in San Francisco. Lovely atmosphere with white linen table clothes and great service. We all had the home made in house burgers and they were AMAZING! First of all, they are huge standing about 3 inches high off the plate with all the toppings, and second, they are SO delicious. This restaurant has amazing sauces as well for your burger. Highly recommend. It's in the top 5 best burgers my husband and I have ever eaten. Plus this place is close to the piers and trams.

The go to place in SF for great Steak and atmosphere.

I had been here about 4 years ago and remembered having a great lunch here. Was in town again and wanted to find a place to go with family for dinner for a great steak. I made the right choice. Ordered the rib-eye steak. It was excellent. All the sides are extra, as is salad, etc. The steak was $38.00 and baked potato was $12.00 I believe. Also had their traditional salad. Others in our group had steak as well and the chicken. Everyone loved their meals. Only recommendation I would give to management. On the traditional salad, says it comes with hard boiled eggs and bacon (similar to a Cobb Salad). I ordered blue cheese dressing on mine, as did another person in our party. One other ordered the salad with ranch. When the salads came, those of us who ordered blue cheese dressing had a few crumbles of bacon and no egg, while the one that ordered the ranch had a mound of bacon and crumbled egg. We flagged down our server and ask why the same salad with blue cheese did not have hardly any bacon and no egg. He said "they" (whoever "they" are) felt the egg and bacon did not pair well with the blue cheese. Damn, that is what you get on a cobb salad. Anyway, he brought out 2 sides of bacon and crumbled egg for our salads and it was delicious. Note- do not state something comes with certain ingredients when it does not, if you happen to order the "wrong" salad dressing.

Houston's is one of my fav spots in the country! This spot was a little more unusual than normal...they were out of their crab cakes, out of their soup of the day, our salmon was raw...it seemed as though they were out of everything we ordered! But through it all ...the customer service was par non! They offered us a bottle of wine as well as dessert to compensate for the portions of our meal they could not deliver! Like I said... it's still my favorite restaurant!!

We went before the Alcatraz night ferry as the restaurant is across the street from the terminal. We had the spinach/artichoke dip which was yummy to start and both had burgers which were really good. The wait staff was terrific.....we would go back.

No comparison to Santa Monica cold greeting on arrival

Was in California for 8 nights staying in Santa Monica and San Francisco , after our 2 visits to Santa Monica thought we would try San Fransisco. We made our reservation for 9 pm arrived and told our table would be ready soon and to have a drink at the bar no problem . After 40 min wait we sat at the table we saw empty on our arrival whilst at the bar we had 2 drinks second round was slow as barman had forgotten I asked for another round . Orders taken food came quite quickly my wife had soup & I had the smoked salmon which was of great standard , main courses were all cold wife sent her chicken back Where they prepared replacement that came after all of us had finished our mains , such a shame the venue is great and a menu to die for but attention to detail and general service especially on arrival lets it down wouldn't return to San Fran but would cue to get in eat in Santa Monica.

I've eaten here about a dozen times over the last few years. I have friends that live nearby and we always make it a point to meet here for dinners. All of the wait staff are professionals, and quite knowledgeable about the menu. The ambiance is great, and if you're lucky they'll have live jazz, usually on Friday or Saturday nights. There's not a dish they don't do well - it's all excellent. We usually get a steak and seafood entree, and split plates, which they are happy to accommodate. In addition, they allow you to bring your own wine with no corkage fee, which is pretty unusual and a nice bonus.

I needed a good restaurant for lunch with a friend after a meeting in the area. I searched on TripAdvisor.com and found this one. It's perfectly situated, there's parking nearby, and the food is great! Waiters were friendly, but not overly so, and quick to respond to requests. There was a nice variety of choices on the menu and the price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. Perfect place for a perfect day!

Great service and selection of spirits. The cocktails are made from fresh ingredients (this is rare in many bars these days). Staff new their products, made suggestions and recommendations about drinks. The place was immaculate with a great team work atmosphere. the food everyone was eating around us looked amazing. Pity the bar is on the other side of the world for me but fully recommend this place for drinks.

Soup of the day great, but all plates are great!!!!!Try it you'll like it!!

Best Customer Service
Rating: 5
Date: May 15, 2016
My wife and I enjoyed a night at the Hillstone in San Francisco. They are the very best at taking care of their customers. We are hearing impaired, and when we told this to our waitress, we were moved to a much quieter table. The service is outstanding in this establishment. For instance, every time ANY waitress passed by our table, they glanced at the table and its contents. They did what was necessary to please the customer, even if it was not their table. They not only used the two waiter program, but the ALL waiter program. The food was brought by another tier of servers from the kitchen. I asked for synchronization of the wine, appetizers, and dinner in a certain time frame, and it was granted. I dislike food coming before I have finished my before dinner drinks, and I like my wine opened with the drink order, so it can breathe. All this was near perfect.They, surprisingly, have a quality control person passing by, rather unnoticed, about every 20 minutes. She had a note pad and was sometimes writing on it. I think this is the key to the outstanding service, and it is a shame that more restaurant do not employ this technique.The food was quite good. We had the soup of the day,a robust chili with chunks of beef and adequate beans; quite thick with cheese on top. My wife had their Prime rib, and said it was the best she had ever eaten. A taste by me confirmed that conclusion. Unfortunately, my rib-eye was tough and chewy, with lots of gristle. It was perfectly cooked, blackened, but the tough quality spoiled this dish.The bottom line is this is a quality place to eat with impeccable service and attention to detail. The food is good and the atmosphere, while quite noisy, was good,
