Epic Steak focuses on the highest quality of meats, seafood, and beverages. Everything that comes out of the kitchen is thoughtfully sourced and expertly presented. My lunch was paired with Hangar One Cocktails (YUM) and the restaurant's bar team knows all about wine and spirits. This is the perfect place for a business lunch, the tables are far enough apart to talk without fear of being overheard, the menu is approachable and sparkles with delicious innovations and classics, and the wait staff knows their stuff. Of course, the lemon tart was CRAZY good!

Came here for a business dinner and enjoyed the cuisine but the most memorable part of the evening was the view! The atmosphere is fantastic with great service. The food is wonderful. Plenty of choices and of course the steak is amazing. We had a group so there was a great deal of tasting and everything was wonderful. It is expensive. Worth the price with the views. 

Sunday brunch

Date: October 23, 2017
My partner and I were out with our tiny 13 year old, 3 pound chihuahua for brunch and decided on this place because it had outside seating. We had a perfect table outside with a view of the Bay Bridge but it was definitely the service that will have us coming back. The staff were friendly, attentive, and quick and they were also that way with our senior chihuahua. You could hardly tell she was there because she's so tiny, but they made every effort to make sure she was taken care of as well. Any establishment that caters to dogs as well as humans deserves an excellent rating. The food is not cheap, especially for Sunday brunch but they did have more options than the other restaurants in that area. Definitely a place to pick to celebrate a special occasion or brunch, but be prepared to spend some money.

I was part of a party of 12 there for a birthday celebration. There is a lot to like about the restaurant - incredible location, nice environment, very courteous staff, and good selection of side dishes. However, this place is not cheap and it is a steak house. I do not think the steak lived up to its self-proclaimed standards. My wife and I, along with two friends sitting next to us all ordered the rib eye, which I think is the measuring stick for any steak house. We all thought it was average tasting at best - plus mine was a bit over cooked. My friend who hosted the dinner had the halibut and he described it as nothing special.

Had the family together in San Fransisco after evacuating from the fires in Sonoma. Picked Epic for quality and ambiance being right by the bay and bay bridge. Food was wonderful. Best steaks around. Our server started off a bit slow but really kicked it into high gear and made sure all was good. May have been a bit busy when we got there. 4.5 on service and 5 on food.

There are so many great restaurants in the area that it's always disappointing to get an 'average' meal here. Especially when the price is over $100 for one person who did not drink alot nor order the most expensive item on the menu. The view is okay, it is on the water, under a bridge but not worth the extra $$. The wine list is not great considering we're 30 minutes away from some of the greatest vineyards around and the list had mostly imports at an average of $180 per bottle. Not too many choices by the glass and 1/2 bottles were $50 and up. The steak was average, I've honestly had better at Long Horn's. It was glopped in sauce - good steak NEVER needs sauce - shame shame shame. The broccolini was charred and bitter to smell and taste. The soup was room temp and good but not great - pretty sure I've had much better from Whole Foods. So, do some research and find something worthy of $100 per person - I'm pretty sure this is not it.

Last night in SF, Concierge at the Palace recommended...a steak house, really? Well, Epic turned out to be wonderful. Classic steak house menu - with some interesting twists. Attentive, friendly, knowledgeable staff. All the dishes were perfectly prepared. And we had a table outside on a very pleasant night with a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge. When the sun set the bridge lit up with a light show that put the Bellagio water show to shame. This is a "must do" if the weather is cooperative.

I tried the 6oz petite filet which was cooked perfect according to my request, pink but no blood. I also ordered 3 local oysters (only one choice). They are creamy & fresh. Although they are not my favourite type of oysters, at the price of $3 per oyster, no complaint. Recommended to sit outside of the bar which is facing the bridge & sea, very romantic.

Went to Epic on a Friday night. incredible view and great ambiance, the restaurant is very cool, nice bar upstairs, good location. For apps we started with the Dungeness crab and shrimp cocktail, both very good, would recommend the dungeness crab. My brother and I spilt the Tomahawk Rib steak for two. Probably not a good idea as it was a rib cut, but we tried it. The steak was average at best, very little taste. Would recommend doing another cut if you visit Epic. The lobster was not good at all. Over cooked and reduced to almost nothing. The mushrooms were a good side as well as the spatzle gratin, both are good with good taste.

We stopped by here after a nearby restaurant seemed a bit too crowded and hectic. Great choice. The serve sat us on the outdoor deck with a front row view to the band and bridge. They nicely accommodated us as they had a special event in that space in 45 minutes which was enough time to enjoy a beverage and the view. Next time we will be back for dinner! That's for having us!

Anniversary Dinner

My husband and I picked Epic Steak to spend our anniversary. We were hoping for a quiet quaint place the atmosphere was very loud. It was a Saturday night. We could not carry on a conversation cause we couldn't hear each other. Other than the loudness it's a great restaurant! Food was very good. We received a free dessert for our anniversary. Very unexpected. Friendly staff. Views were amazing. I would definitely go back, but not for a special occasion. 

Very nice. Pricey but would go agoin. Sit inside though on cold evenings!

It's highly priced, but we really enjoyed it and without knowing what other options there are in SF (we were only in SF for 3 days) it was worth the money for us. The food was really good, the deserts were amazing. A good view in the evening of the Bay Bridge too and the ambiance of the place was good.A couple of notes for improvement/suggestions: I had to send my steak back as it was a little under done for my liking (i wanted medium-rare but got something much more rare really), but this did not detract much from the experience. I was in the US for a couple of weeks and had a few steaks in really nice well known restaurants during our time and each time they came out cooked differently when I had asked for Medium Rare. Being a fairly keen steak eater in London on some of the most well known/well respected restaurants in London (Hawksmoor/Savoy/Goodmans) I know what I like, although I also know how different places can cook a steak differently.All in all though it was really good. we have a great time and i'd go again - one of the booths would have been nice but they were booked up the night we got there.I would though recommend sitting properly indoors in the evenings as it was a little cold for us in what i'd describe as a terrace area with shutters.

Went for lunch. Nice shore view, good service. Terrible steaks. The boneless rib eye was a generous portion 12 ounces for $29, seemingly a bargain. First, they couldn't get the doneness right. We asked for medium rare and medium, we got rare and medium rare. We sent the rare steak back, asked for medium, and got it back medium rare. At this point we gave up on doneness. The meat was flavorless with no hint of char on it. In addition, it wasn't rested at all, as you cut through the meat lots of juices came out. Green beans with truffle aioli was good.Overall, I would be distrustful of a steakhouse that could not deliver a medium steak in two tries.

Firstly I have to say the setting is outstanding and the food was good. However I felt it was ruined by not being allowed to sit outside when others were but only a quarter full. Also service was very rushed, we arrived at about 9:10pm and ordered our mains, halfway through eating our mains our sides arrived. Followed by the question would we like to see the desert menu, would have been nice to finish eating first.

Birthday dinner disappointment
Rating: 2
Date: August 27, 2017
I'd like to start this by saying that the staff was terrific. They were extremely attentive and helpful. The atmosphere was great, a little loud for our style but overall really good.My main grievance is with the chef. He must have no idea how to cook a proper steak. I ordered the 9 oz filet mignon. Ive had filet at some of the best steak houses in the country. I am pretty sure this is one of the most expensive filets I've seen. And it was terrible, both the initial dish and the 2nd one was worse. The first was supposed to be medium but was dry and overcooked. Only the very center was pink, the rest was grey. The manager agreed, but came back to tell me the chef disagreed and that it was in fact his idea of a perfect medium. That's the issue. The 2nd steak came out within 10 minutes, I appreciate the rush. But this steak was the worst filet I've ever had. The chef must have used a torch on it because the steak tasted like straight butane. Filet does not normally have a ton of flavor, but this was clearly burned with a butane flame and it was awful. My dad ordered the cut of prime rib, and it was close to chewing leather. Just not what you'd expect for the crazy high price you pay. I was hesitant to write a review because the staff was really nice and made sure we were happy, but seeing as it was a birthday dinner, and we spent more money than I could even believe on the quality of the meal. I was seriously disappointed in the food. The chef needs to figure it out. Otherwise the restaurant was overall great.

Our first time at Epic Strack while visiting San Francisco. My wife and I both had the filets and they were extremely tender.

This was excellent as well. Service was also top of the line. Our table was next to a window overlooking the Bay and Bay Bridge.We will definitely be back when in town.

We enjoyed the menu very much, decent variety of fish, seafood and vegetarian options. On the pricier side of restaurants but absolutely worth it. Picked dishes were fresh, homemade and very high quality. Loved the warm and crusty bread served in the beginning. You cannot beat the view, feels like dining directly under the bridge.

The staff we helpful and friendly throughout although I we had a lot of different servers, I prefer having just one if possible buts that personal choice. The food itself was great, not the best steak I'd ever eaten but cooked just the way we wanted and with a good mix of sides to match. It is on the expensive side but with the food top notch and the view even better, I think it was worth it.

Indulge in a real dungeness crab cocktail that feeds 2 and follow it with something fun. I love an EPIC burger with bacon any day of the week.

I really like this steakhouse. It only got four stars because of a few service problems. But there is lots to love here. Start with the view. The Epic sits at the base of the Bayside Bridge, which offers a spectacular view at night. The bridge features an amazing, ever changing light show. Prices are steep at this steakhouse. You might call the prices Epic! Steaks run from $33 for a six ounce filet to $230 for a porterhouse for two. My 14 oz prime rib went for $54. All main courses are $30+. The Dungeness crab cocktail was tasty with house made cocktail sauce, although pricey at $24.00. I loved their "build a salad" feature. You pick the lettuce, toppings and dressing. They make a salad that's big enough for a meal. They also have a cool build your own Sundae feature for dessert. Same concept with three scoops of ice cream and toppings. Our food was excellent and the prices didn't scare us. It was the big meal of our vacation. However, the service was lacking. We didn't feel like honored guests. They didn't seem to have the attitude of elegance I find at other fine steakhouses. There were delays and gaps in our service with no explanation offered. In fairness to Epic, we could have hit the wrong server on the wrong night. You may have exquisite service when you visit. I know the food was top notch and well worth a visit if you can afford the "Epic" prices!

A bit pricey but typical for the area. There were three of us, and I think dinner was around $350. The entire restaurant has great Bay Bridge views, but staff is happy to accommodate requests to sit next to window, etc. Business crowd atmosphere, not a touristy as other restaurants in the area.

Stopped in around 3 in the afternoon. My daughter and I are in the upstairs bathroom area. We ordered off the bar menu and shared 3 plates: steak tartare, fries with bearnais sauce and ceasar salad. Used a little of the bearnaise sauce on the steak tartare which was the best preparation of that dish I have eaten. The ceasar salad was perfect for sharing as the leaves were served whole with shaved parmesan. All in all, a very nice deconstructed meal and much cheaper than eating in the main restaurant. Had a cucumber, mint martini which was pretty good too. Great view through the tall windows.

Frustrating Service on Anniversary

First visit to SF, this is where our local friends had told us we should go for our anniversary dinner....It was a beautiful view and our food was delicious- except the lobster bisque (we were not fans.) We were greeted with a "Happy Anniversary" when we arrived, then we were seated. After waiting approximately 10 minutes for our server to approach us the first time, we should have known, but that is how his service was the entire night. He was much more concerned with his other tables surrounding us, schmoozing it up that he rarely stopped by to check on us. I never should have asked to see the dessert menu, it took him 20 minutes to bring it, another 15 to come by our table for us to ask for the bill, and I left the restaurant after waiting another 20 minutes. I decided to go outside and watch the Bay Bridge and calm myself and leave my husband to deal with him.

It was mediocre and our waiter seemed uninterested in us. Other than that, everything was very good. Make sure to check out the upstairs bar as well.

EPIC Failure

Date: July 3, 2017
Over rated and disappointing pretty much sums it up. After doing research, we decided on Epic Steak as our anniversary dinner. Men who love steak will appreciate this review. Men who know their steak will appreciate this review. Men who cook steak will appreciate this review. With that said, here we go. Typically a rib eye guy, my wife and I both went with the filet as the rib eye was way too much meat. As we know, the filet has several parts, the center cut, the tail, the chateaubriand and the chain. I was served the the chateaubriand and my wife the chain. The chain! I use the chain in stroganoff and the wife uses it in a crock pot. I was speechless. Not to mention the wife's "chain" was overcooked. I let it all slide as it was our anniversary and didn't want to cause a scene. At this price level, center cut is the only cut to serve. Regardless, I will give the restaurant kudos on service and the view. The view is outstanding, the atmosphere is excellent. The asparagus with thai chili is excellent as well. But the main event, the STEAK, was beyond reproach. I guess people that don't know meat would recommend Epic, but I can't recommend. Complete and utter disappoint.

Outstanding service - cooks need to go to school

The service was first class - especially as they had to deal with errors from the kitchen. I and my dining companion's steaks both came out raw when we asked for, respectively, medium rare and medium. 2nd try they were both overdone. Staff was efficient and apologetic and the kitchen got it right on the third try. I'm sure the manager found the one guy in the kitchen who knew how to cook at that point. Service staff made it right in all they ways they could have, kudos to them. However the fact remains that this is supposed to be a steak house and the kitchen blew the steaks, both of them, twice.Plus, for sixty bucks, the ribeye should really be a pretty darn good cut. And it was, but not what it should have been for the price. And the salad dressing was overly acidic. So, well, guess its not quite as Epic as it once was.

I was recommended this place by a colleague and it did not fail. The food was absolutely mouth watering and to die for probably up there with one of the best meals I've tasted. The views are also amazing and it's well worth a visit to eat dinner with this amazing scenery. I did request a few months in advance to sit by the window as advised by my colleague as it was my sisters bday and mentioned this on my booking and to my disappointment I was quite far away from the window and my request was not considered at all. I have also been to restaurants that have done something a little special like a small birthday dessert for the person celebrating their birthday. It's not compulsory obviously not but it's a nice touch when restaurants do consider an individual but this restaurant did not even though I also mentioned this on my booking. That part along with the requested window seat was a big let down but the food was amazing.

Four of us went to the restaurant after an afternoon play. We arrived for the first seating and ordered cocktails for the table. The cocktails were served ten minutes after the order and of course, the bar was busy. Really?We ordered the seafood special for appetizers. The special had a very nice presentation. With four, it was not enough, especially for the $120 cost.The steaks were fine. My wife, not a big complainer (really), thought the steak was not at the level of being at a high priced restaurant.The desert of cherries jubilee was not anything close to any desert we had ever order-no ice cream?The wine steward was a great guy and knew his wines. The highlight of the dining experience. Anyway, very nice scenic view. Would I return to this restaurant? No, especially with the restaurant Boulevard right down the street.

Great view, best service, top notch food and drinks. I love it's sister restaurant, Water Bar, but it was booked, so "settled" for Epic for Father's Day brunch.Perfect. The guys loved it and so did we.Drinks were well made, food was great, prices reasonable considering it is SF with a view, and service was attentive but not pushy or rushed.

The best steakhouse I have visited in quite some time. Dining solo is sometimes a hassle for restaurants but not Epic. I was seated at a great table with a view of the Bay Bridge after having a beer in the upstairs bar which was also awesome.Valentina the Sommelier was great and really knowledgable. Wait staff excellent. One of the door girls a bit overly officious - she kept the walking around the restaurant with a clip board and noting what stage of your meal you were at - a little off putting especially when eating solo!!!The steak was amazing as were the sides. Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for the "build your own" sundae - cool idea. Next time!

The view alone is worth the price of admission

Was here with three others for a business dinner. We were seated outside where the view is to die for. Had a couple drinks while getting things started, then ordered dinner. Two of the guys had steaks, the other two of us had salmon. Food was good but nothing truly outstanding so far as I am concerned. It was much like I would expect to find and any of a dozen or more high end steak houses. But the service was good, the look and feel of the restaurant was first class, so yes, overall the experience was a good one. But it did not have a signature, San Francisco feel to it like some of the other unique places I have been in the Bay area.

Excellent service .Perfectly cooked steaks with good sauce selections and yummy sides . Ordered 2 of the potato gratin ! Make your own ice cream sundaes was a hit for the kids. This is a must try whilst in SFO specially since there seemed to be very few good steak houses that were opened for lunch .

In SF alone for a week and decided to have a special night out - picked EPIC based on the reviews and proximity to my hotel.Lovely atmosphere and great views. I sat outside with fantastic water and bridge views.Steak was really well cooked - I ended up going for the petit filet so that I had room for dessert. Glad I did, the ice cream sundae was a winner!

My wife attended Epic tonight as part of our honeymoon. As a result of experiencing this venue 3 years ago, the expectations still remained high. We had recommended this place to 10+ international clients that regularly visit San Francisco.We were greated by 2 beautiful hostesses at the front door. After indulging on a cocktail upstairs - in the bar, we re-attended the restaurant and were escorted to our window table. This is when our experience commenced its decline. The server was vague, not-engaging and not informative. (I found the table water to me more engaging then the server). We enjoyed our meal and accompanied wines with minimal engagement from 'our' server. When the bill came to be paid the total was just under $500. We provided the server with a gratuity reflective of the service provided - however we were approached by the server and informed that we 'should reconsider the gratuity as it was customary in California to provide a 15%+ tip'. The server advised that this was customary!Based on the confrontation by the Server my wife and I bludgeoned agreed to the 10% 'tip'. After the confrontation I approached the hostess and a male staff member (who I assumed was the executive Chef).I expressed my frustration and insult experienced, to which was provided an apology. Based on the experience I would not currently recommend this venue as a dinning location. Furthermore, the entire incident has put a 'foul-taste' on our honeymoon in San Francisco. Ps- I am more then willing to provide additional information if it's requested.

I made a reservation online, but we were running late. I called the restaurant and they were very understanding and held our reservation for us. We arrived around 7:30. We were seated at a 2-top next to the window with a view of the water and the bridge. It was breathtaking. The restaurant was very busy - lots of men in suits. Delicious sour dough bread was brought to our table immediately after sitting down. I ordered the "Craft your own salad" with butter leaf and arugula, bacon, apples and candy pecans with champagne vinaigrette. It was fresh and perhaps one of the best salads I've had at a steak house. For the main course my son ordered the 9 oz filet and the Julia Child potatoes. I ordered the 6 oz filet with grilled vegetables. Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious.For dessert we decided to split something and we contemplated the build your own sundae or the lemon tart. The table of men next to us all had the sundae, but we opted for the lemon tart. It was refreshing and just the right amount of sweetness to end the meal. It was however, very tiny and next time, we are going to order the sundae.We were treated so nicely by everyone we encountered. From the hostess to the person taking us to our table to the waiter. I believe his name was Kevin. Everyone was very friendly and seemed to care that we had an enjoyable time.

I believe this was own 3rd trip to Epic steak house. WE had a 7:30 reservation on 05/13/2017. Own palne arrived early and I called to see if we could move our reservation up to 5ish. They were so kind and the young lady said she would get a great table. WE arrived alittle early and went up to bar for a drink. It was busy, but service was fast and drinks good. They gave a great table, with a view of the bridge and the bay. The meal was perfect, service great and desert was so good. I can not say enough how good this place is! It is also great to see the manager walking around the room asking guests how everything was. more managers need to do the same. This place a great for a special night or just a night you would like great food. It is not cheap, but it is worth it!

Massive shortfall on service and value

This meal fell massively short on service and value; one of the worst high end dining experiences I've had for a work dinner with clients. Separate from the specifics of the evening, this restaurant has a very high price point, especially with an egregiously overpriced wine menu; any item we asked for on the side from salad dressing to bread to steak sauce to sprinkles for a sundae either required multiple follow ups or never delivered at all. For us the night took a turn for the worse when bites into our appetizer course waiters came to the table expecting to deliver our steaks (something about their timing was massively off, but they never acknowledged this). Upon realizing they were earlier they must have gone back to sit under heat lamps for 15 minutes. Once actually delivered 3 of the 4 steaks needed to be sent back since they were then overcooked and dried out. Profuse apologies and proclamations of they had no idea how this could have occurred followed - all in all this is an embarrassing back and forth to go through in front of clients.What took the over the edge for disappointment was how when the bill was delivered, with another pained apology, the waiter said the deserts and all recooked steaks were taken off the check - which was more than I expected. Except the steaks weren't taken off. When I pointed this out, he advised that he meant that second round of the 3 replacement steaks weren't on the bill. This is insulting. I appreciate complaints about a high end meal going wrong ring tone deaf, but this is a lot of money, it is in front of clients and then to have a waiter try to appease the situation by basically lying about the extent they went to remedy it is disrespectful.I can't give them one star because the food did tend to be pretty good and the location, especially the view, are great, but I highly recommend taking your business elsewhere. The service is so poor and value is not there.

This was my wife and my second time dining at Epic Steak. When we decided to take a weekend trip to San Francisco, one of the first things we did was get a reservation for Epic Steak. The food and the service was phenomenal and the view of the Bay Bridge at night is spectacular. Folks, you cannot go wrong with this restaurant. From the first bite, we both looked at each other and remembered why we love this place. Delicious! By far, the best place we have eaten in this US of A.

My husband and I were in San Fran for the weekend and wanted to have a great steak dinner. We looked up this place and chose it because of all the great reviews. It did not disappoint. The food was delicious -- loved the Cesar Salad and the prime rib. The cocktails were also very good. Our waitress was the best -- very attentive and gave great suggestions. The overall feel and atmosphere are great. This is a great place to come for a romantic dinner or to celebrate a special occassion. You can dress up or come in dressed casual. The restaurant sits on the bay and have a great view of the water and one of the bridges. Very nice!

My husband and I had dinner here and it was a fabulous meal. Service was exceptional. We had a lovely table right by the window with a gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge, but the views are great from almost any table. This was our second visit to Epic and we would go again on our next trip. The crab appetizer was great. We also ordered the Julia Child's potatoes which were rich and luscious! The salted caramel cheesecake was the perfect way to top off our dinner.

The service was great as our host was not familiar with either the wines or some of the foods. The staff bent over to help and assist her select making suggestions which were spot on. The service was quick with drinks and the food ( mostly steaks ) were ok. Steaks were very thick and weren't quite cooked to my choice of medium. Suggest if you like medium ask for medium to well. The seafood starters were quite good with the crab and the tuna both very tasty . Great location on the water with a fantastic view of the Bay Bridge.

Based on the number of positive reviews and the recommendation from a local who has dined here before, I must have picked an especially bad night for dinner at Epic. What a letdown in many ways. Nice atmosphere and good table service. But they were out of the wine I ordered off the menu. The waiter said he had to check whether the appetizer a friend ordered was out or still available. (It was available.) My $60 rib eye arrived barely warm and had to be sent back. The experience felt in so many ways like a restaurant that had been open a week and was working through problems, not a well-established place with a good reputation. At no point did anyone offer a free dessert or drink for all the trouble, nor did anyone other than the waiter ask me if the steak was better the second time around. When it was time to leave, it took 5-7 minutes just for the valet to appear. He was busy with other customers, but the area was obviously understaffed. And then I got in to find he had adjusted my seat. Great. I'm average size, so my settings should have worked fine for a very short drive. It would have been a poor dining experience even at half the price. At the actual tab, it was terrible.

This was recommended by Hotel and it did not disappoint....

We went to EPIC to celebrate a very special occasion and had booked online weeks in advance leaving a message that it would be great if we could have a table with a view. As we were from out of town, the restaurant had been recommended by friends who said if you want to go to a San Francisco restaurant with quality food, an excellent wine list, great service and a view of the bay bridge, then this is the place to go. As we didn't hear back from the restaurant we didn't expect to get a table with a view but that was not the case. We got one of the best tables, with the most wonderful view of the bay bridge and light show. The service was second to none, with our waiter suggesting what turned out to be a beautiful bottle of local wine. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or are visiting San Francisco and want to go to a restaurant that is above the rest, go to EPIC.

My boyfriend and I stopped for lunch on our way to the ballpark. We both had the Kobe steak burger, AWESOME! Perfect portion for a late lunch. We sat on the patio with facing a wonderful view of the Bay Bridge. There was a small incident of a pigeon attacking me trying to get out of the clear plastic walled patio...but the server and staff quickly jumped to my rescue (along with my boyfriend and another customer). They offered me a free glass of wine to "calm my nerves."

Epic was recommended to us by friends, literally every friend we asked about SF! We went there on our wedding day for dinner and asked for a table with a view when making the booking. We were not sure what would be the outcome as we didn't hear back from the restaurant.We arrived and was greeted with a huge smile and congratulations from the staff (all of them! Even the restaurant manager came to congratulate us!).Our lovely waiter Paul, shared his knowledge and recommendations of the wine and Napa Valley. Our food was delicious!

Had a lovely business dinner here. Service was excellent which I think can be tough for a group of 16. Great cocktails to start, good salads and delicious wine. I didn't choose the wine but enjoyed the red. As other reviews note, the location and view is stunning. Everything about our dinner was great with one exception. They don't offer a good vegetarian option. I had a salad and the cheese plate. Another in our group had a salad and a vegetable side. Big points for a great dessert selection. I had the build your own sundae and it was the best thing I've eaten in a week!

Took my wife and daughter to Epic for our last night in San Francisco. Night started off a little slowly when we pulled up and were told that the restaurant does not validate parking. This is a high end restaurant where people dress up and most women are in heels, yet the options for parking are blocks away or pay $20.00 for valet. We paid the valet parking and went inside and that was the end of the problems for the evening.We were immediately seated outside with a wonderful view of the Bay Bridge. The waiters adjusted the outdoor heaters so my wife would be comfortable (she's always cold). Service was excellent all night. They have a very extensive wine list and I even had a glass myself. I am not a drinker but if the restaurant has a GOOD Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand I'll have a glass. They had an excellent one. The Somalia came by and my wife tried a few reds and found a really good one. For a restaurant to be truly 5 stars in my mind, it has to have the ability to find a good glass of wine for my wife. Since we can never get a bottle (only she drinks red) and every restaurant has a different selection, it's difficult to get the same thing each time so we need a good Somalia to help us. Epic did.For food, I had the prime rib and my wife and daughter each had steaks and they were all excellent. The waiter suggested a dessert and we tried that as well and it was wonderful. He even went outside with us to take pictures with the bridge in the background. All in all, a highly recommended restaurant.

I'm going to be serious here. The food was delicious and amazing but sitting outside right near the Bay Bridge was unbelievable and unforgettable. This restaurant was beautiful. We both had steak and they were delicious, but I'm going to dream of the view of the bridge lit up on a clear night for the rest of my life. It's a rare occasion that I remember a view over the food, but it was spectacular and the food was great. The whole dinner was absolutely unforgettable.

You can dine outside and feel like you're under the Bay Bridge, but the service was painfully slow and steaks not at all "epic." If you are going to have a restaurant name using words like Epic and Steak - you need to be fantastic every time. This was average. The setting is lovely. Not a big fan of spiders showing up on the table, but maybe this is part of outdoor dining by the water? Would not return nor recommend, not with so many Michelin star possibilities within walking distance.

When a name of 'Epic Steak' you do expect something exceptional ... and regretfully that wasn't the case. Almost all the steaks at our table of nine were undercooked. Moreover, the meat was not tender and we all were pretty disappointed. The only reason for not giving a lower rating were the exceptional view of the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge (with the LED-light 'show') and the very good crab cakes as a starter.

Kkay, so I should have known, right? A steakhouse in San Francisco on the water with a view of the bridge on a Friday night... but the bill still surprised me. The ambiance here is wonderful, and the view is spectacular. The food is very good, not excellent. The drinks are excellent. We brought a local friend here while visiting San Francisco. The tab was $300 for the three of us. We shared one appetizer, had two drinks altogether, our dinners, and two desserts total. They get you with their ala carte menu. If you don't order a side, you receive a lonely piece of meat on your big white plate. I am not normally someone who complains about paying a lot at a good restaurant. In fact, I expect it. But for some reason this seemed particularly high to me for what we were served. There are so many choices in SF, I don't think we will be back. I will say - if money is no object, or you are celebrating a truly special night - go there!

Probably the best!

This restaurant is equipped with all essentials you need to celebrate a great dinning experience. Stunning view towards bay bridge, excellent prepared top quality steaks and the most important their staff. We had the pleasure of being looked after by Diego who is highly professional and extremely friendly. The management also does its rounds and engages pleasantly with all guests. Another highlight to mention was the cheese cake which we loved so much! Definitely in all areas a 5/5* well done and keep it up. Thank you Diego for an unforgettable experience.

Idk where to start. The filet mignons were all well done instead of medium rare. If you have been to fancy steakhouses, you would quickly realize what you are getting is disappointing. salad was filled with toooo much sauce. I literally had to clean the lettuce to avoid extra calories. The lobster was cold. No "happy birthday from the waiter" or anything on the desert we ordered. 197 dollars was spent and we both end up in the closet restroom after the dinner. This is sad because I made calls and reservations to let them know about the birthday occasion and still this is what we got.
