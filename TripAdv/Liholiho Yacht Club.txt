Yummy, yummy, yummy! We came here for our daughter's birthday. The food & service was absolutely amazing! There aren't enough words to explain how much we enjoyed this dining experience. We want to get back there for the Ohana meal, heard that was really good... just need to have the right timing to make the reservation.

Wow! Amazing meal and fantastic service.

The food here is amazing. Everything we ordered was delicious. All of the wait staff were friendly and very attentive but not overly so. The kitchen is open to the whole restaurant which was fun to watch. I loved their take on tuna poke.

Had never really eaten Hawaiian food before. We booked here on our last night in San Fran and were delighted we did. There was a great atmosphere and we had to book in advance. The menu was expensive(as is typical for San Francisco), but each course we had was fantastic. A really fresh flavour from everything we had, with a great fusion of fruit throughout the food. Really loved the food and would love to go back!

My friend and I walked in at 5pm without reservations and were able to snag two seats at the bar. The place was humming by 5:15pm and our charming bar tender was ploughing thru cocktails at a great rate. We shared five dishes and all five were full of flavour, fresh and overall outstanding. If I had a favourite it would have been the Duck Liver Toast. Our said bartender was attentive and made a mean Negroni. There wines by the glass were very good and they have an excellent Saki list. Next time I am back in SFO this will be at the top of my 'To Go' list.

One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. Everything on the menu is delicious. Some recommendations since the reservations system is a little complicated. Go early, sit at the bar, have a few drinks, and have dessert.

The Liholiho Yacht Club came up on a list of cheap eats in San Francisco so my boyfriend and I decided to go there on a Thursday night. We did not have any reservations so it was no surprise that the restaurant did not have any open dinner tables. However, we were given the choice of going to their lounge downstairs (apparently called Louie's Gen-Gen) which featured additional tables but with an abbreviated menu. We gladly took the choice.The main floor of the restaurant looks very contemporary, with a kitchen in the center of the floor, with 4-6 person tables all around, as well as a bar with seating at the front part of the restaurant as you enter. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side so I wouldn't go there if you are looking for a quiet or romantic atmosphere. Downstairs we were seated at a 2-person bistro-like table. The abbreviated menu consisted of different small plates. We ordered three different ones. One was the Hamachi poke, which were served on pork rind and sprinkled with sesame oil and radish. This dish was just bursting with flavors and the food looked pretty as well with its presentation. Another dish we ordered was the Ahi Poke Bowl, which had avocado, spicy mayo, tamari soy sauce, sesame, and furikake dressing. This is another dish that had so much great flavor. The third dish I wasn't too crazy about, which is the avocado cracker, served with a Nori cracker, avocado, and cream cheese. For some reason the flavor of the Nori cracker didn't work well with me and the cream cheese or avocado did not do anything to overcome the bad flavor of the Nori cracker. Perhaps it was a bad batch, but I'm not sure I would have Nori cracker again. All in all, I would go back to LihoLiho, perhaps this time getting a reservation for the main floor upstairs so I have a wider choice of menu items. If you like small-plate dishes with amazing, fresh fish, LihoLiho is the place to go!

This is our 5th visit. Slightly disappointed, given our past experiences.- Duck hearts: Over cooked, so it had a "livery" taste.- Beef tongue: Wonderfully seasoned, with perfect tenderness.- Manila clams: Tasty, but too salty.- Fried rice with baby shrimp & spam: Perfect dish!- Cornish game hen: Nice crispy crust, but the breast was bit dry and the fried broccoli was too burnt and greasy. The combination of tamari honey glaze and pineapple was too sweet for my taste.The service was good. Extremely noisy, even on a Tuesday night.

We made reservations a month in advance so that we were sure we would get in...we called the concerge at the hotel we had booked in SF for recommendations and this was one of the places they sent us to.

Striving millennials with something to prove might get off on the social Darwinism of the walk-in seating policy here. For anyone over 29 & 1/2 it feels like playing a video game for the first time with a false set of instructions ... I stopped by at around 6:30 on my first full day in San Francisco, and it was packed. The staff told me that it's so popular most people show up at 5:30-6:00, but I could hover behind someone at the bar and I'd be guaranteed their seat when they left. That seemed a bit demeaning, so I left and wend to Sanraku sushi. I sat at the bar right away and had a great meal. Tonight (a Thursday), I stopped by Liholiho at 5:20. It was packed again, and I was told I could stand at the "bump out" of the bar and wait for a seat to become available. I had a couple of unexceptional drinks and waited for about 40 minutes. The food all around me looked good, but long before anyone was ready to leave, a hipster and his girl came and hovered behind the couple sitting next to me. I thought about confronting him and telling him I was already waiting on that couple. But I decided this was all too stupid. I paid up, and went to Fino, a nice Italian restaurant at 624 Post St. nearby. There I got a seat, the waitstaff was excellent, and so was the food. Liholiho may be worth it if you have a reservation or a lot of time and the right attitude. Otherwise, try one of the other excellent restaurants nearby and you'll have a much more enjoyable time.

I finally had the pleasure of trying this restaurant recently. Because I had come with a large group, we reserved the Ohana Table that seats 12 max. This table only has a chef's tasting menu served family style but gives you ample portions and you get to try a lot of the regular menu. On the night that I went, we had the following:* Togarashi popcorn, courtesy of the chef* Yellowtail sashimi, courtesy of the chef* Tuna poke* Fried oyster with beef carpaccio* Duck liver toast* Iceberg lettuce with furikake crunch* Cabbage salad with marinated squid and crispy tripe* Manila clams in coconut curry with naan* Fried cornish game hen with crispy broccoli* Country pork roast* Wagyu ribeye steak with garlic shallot infused rice (extra add)* Housemade spam with furikake rice (extra add)* Coconut butter mochi* Bake Hawaii with carmelized pineapple ice cream and vanilla chiffonService was spot on and we never felt rushed. Dishes came out in a timely manner and we were pretty full by the end. The dishes were innovative and so different than what I was expecting. We had the early seating at 5:30 and we were told that we would need to leave by 8:15 so that they could prepare for the late seating. The email communications from the restaurant were detailed and clear. If you can get a reservation, this is worth a try. One of the best meals that I've had in 2017.

Okay. So I remain fascinated by anyone who is willing to wait over two hours for a table or even wait in line for a restaurant to open - any restaurant. So being "patronized" by the hostess and feeling scolded for having the audacity to show up at 5:30 for dinner sort of set me back a bit. Another hostess, however, was quick to suggest we head downstairs to the bar. Different food menu but figured it was worth a try. If we didn't like it we could always find another place for dinner. Ended up having a great time with the wait staff and enjoyed many of the appetizers and craft drinks. So I can't speak to the restaurant but downstairs bar and food was very good.

Professional but in a relaxed atmosphere. Take your server literally when the explain the menu. One bite aps is just that. Shared aps are for 2 or 3 people. Big plates are enough for 4! They don't skimp on their quality ingredients. Cocktails are tasty and strong! There is a more casual bar downstairs called GenGen. We started with the Romano bean Katsura with a dipping sauce. Then we shared the grilled shorttib with bone marrow escargot mashed potatoes, Then we had the grilled pork should porterhouse. All tasting Ono! Too full for dessert but they looked killer! If it weren't so damn hard to get it, I'd come more often. Chef Ravi Kapur of Hawaii and formerly of Boulevard and Prospect has it together!

Very nice staff. The restaurant was full but they offered us to sit or stand in the bar. For us, who just wanted something easy it was perfect. We ordered tuna, hopper shrimp and some squid to share. Especially the two first dishes was amazing! We got the food fast and with good service. I definitely recommend this place. It's not so cheap but sometimes it's worth to pay a little extra.

If you're planning to come here, be prepare to make reservations a month ahead of time. Since they only have limited seated tables available. However, they do have the bar area where you can wine and dine as well. Even around 5pm when they first open, this place is busy. If you are driving here, make sure to come early to look for parking as well. Certain area around the neighborhood might not be the safest place to park. The food is great, more like tapas portion. So flavorable and unique. Def. try their Short Rib with Bone marrow and Escargot (delicious). Beef tongue, Spam and rice, and of course the Bake Hawaiian for dessert is a MUST.

This is my second time at Liholiho. I was there in February 2016 and knew I had to come back. The food and drinks are very creative and yummy. I swear this was the best salad I've ever had (and I had to skip the pesto and cheese due to allergies). Ribs were superb. Octopus was very good, just not as good as the other two items. I thoroughly enjoyed the Surfer Rosa cocktail; I was a little worried it would be too sweet but it wasn't. The hibiscus + smoky mezcal were a great combination.Keep in mind this is hard to get into with reservations but they hold back 1/3 of the tables. We showed up at 6 expecting to get in between 8 - 8:30. They take your number and give you 15 minutes to show up. We weren't too far away when the call came at 7:15. We shall return.

We visited here based on the recommendations of TripAdvisor. We thought the food was excellent and possibly some of the best we have every had. I would recommend the clams and SPAM dishes. They were both great. They also had a selection of wines with the barman being very knowledge of the productions. We were very disappointed with the front of house staff managing reservations. I, along with another group were both told to sit in the same seats. When we approached them about their mistake we were informed "Its not our problem now, sort it out between yourselves". If you offer reserved seating, its your problem and not the guests fault. Great food, great drinks but selective customer service.

We were told about this place by an awesome server at the ENO Wine Bar on Geary. (Another find.) Actually had to pay with a non-refundable deposit to make an online reservation and we took a chance, since it had been so highly recommended. Wow!!!! We we not disappointed. Everything from beginning to end was exceptional! Our server, Melissa, guided us through the menu and made excellent recommendations, even warning us not to over-order, as everything was shareable and the portions were ample. Tuna poke and yellowtail sashimi with strawberries to start; grilled shortrib with twice baked bone marrow potato; a true halibut tail(!) cooked to perfection and heaped with buttery vegetables; and the Flintstone-like slab of beef ribs with kimchi chili sauce. All outstanding. While the guys cleaned up the meat, I cleaned up on all the vegetable accompaniments. Everything so perfectly delicious. Then, just as we thought it couldn't get any better, we ordered multiple desserts -- to share. Beautifully-crafted pieces of scrumptious dessert art. All in all a very memorable affair.

We visited over Memorial Day weekend without reservations, arriving around 7pm. The earliest we could get a table was at their last seating, 10pm. The other options were to stand at the bar and wait for a bar seat to open (same menu) or go downstairs to the other bar (limited menu). We chose to stand at the bar. Service was great, we immediately were given menus and drinks. We opted to start with the poke appetizer (very good) and were able to get seats prior to it being brought to us. We had 2 of the shrimp small plates which were also good and filling. We decide not to have a main course - although I saw many people sharing one. We did go for the Baked Hawaiin desert which was amazing -- basically a Baked Alaskan with pineapple ice cream. If you know that you will be in the area, I would recommend a reservation but standing/sitting at the bar was a great experience also.

A very modern and open restaurant. Reservations are difficult to come by. I thought it would have more of a Hawaiian vibe. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The food was excellent abet expensive. I didn't mind the prices but for portion size, a little on the skimpy side. The beef ribs were tasty, tender, and fall off the bone. The Poke on nori crackers were killer. The pork was ok but not the best dish. The spam fried rice was different but I've had better. The shrimp were very delicious and sweet. This is a very nice place and I'd recommend you try it once and draw your own conclusions as to if it suits your palate and budget.

Years after liholiho has been open we finally snagged a reservation. If you're there fortunate few who are able to get a reservation in this well known eatery in the city than hold on tight to it! I had a lot of expectation for the meal. Even though it wasn't the most mind blowing meal, it was very delicious and worth trying to score a second reservation. Ordered the beef tongue steam buns, Manila clams, off menu spam, and the game hen. Sadly we weren't able to squeeze in dessert, even though we really wanted too. I guess that means we just have to come again!

Mediocre overall. While it was a pleasant experience with some great dishes and some just-OK ones, I was not majorly impressed and it wasn't great bang for the buck. We ordered the hopper shrimp, the beef-tongue buns, soft-shelled crab, and shrimp fried rice. The hopper shrimp with miso avocado and walnuts was my favorite. Excellent taste and unique flavors. The beef-tongue buns were just OK. The soft-shelled crab was a large portion, but quite generic in taste--you can get this for half the price with similar taste/quality elsewhere. The shrimp fried rice was mostly rice, with just a bit of shrimp on top (i.e., disappointing). For $82 for just these four dishes, I don't think it was worth it. The restaurant was also very noisy; which is a minus for me. I may revisit to try out some other dishes, but not a high urgency or priority given my first experience.

Snagging a reservation at 6:00 is not easy. We used their web site to make it on the first minute that allows new reservations on that date. This place is fully-booked as we enter. The vibe reminds me of State Bird Provisions.We ordered two small and one large appetizers. Then we had one entree of Cornish game hen. The broccoli heads were burned beyond tasting, but we're told that it was intentional. That was beyond convention IMO.If I return, I will order another large appetizer rather than an entree.

Dropped in alone for an early dinner without a reservation - seems that if you get in early enough there would be some seats at the bar. Excellent service - the lady behind the bar was part sommelier, part bartender and obviously knew the menu very well when asked for recommendations. Decided on a half portion of their take on poke - marinated tuna served with a slightly spicy mayo and microgreens on a savoury seaweed cracker, a shrimp, avocado grape and walnut salad with a sweet, nutty dressing and a decidedly indulgent main of short rib with escargots served with marrow in the bone. Had two of their house special cocktails over the meal. The "Bitter End" - rum, grapefruit, lime and bitters and the Pineapple Peat - vermouth, pineapple and lemon - both had very distinct flavours, and didn't clash with the meal.

This is not a fine dining gourmet experience (not a criticism just a clarification to manage people's expectations). This is unique take on Hawaiian cuisine that is closer to comfort food-asian style than to high-end gourmet establishment I think going with big group (we had 15 people) and getting tasting menu at $55/person was the best deal and we were able to try wide variety of dishes.Overall I liked it with some dishes were amazing and some were Ok-ish (too heavy on sweet sauces and sesame in my subjective opinion).Best dishes: Marinated squid, tripe and cabbage salad and Country Pork with sunchokes (which was much better than description)The worst: Dessert that came with tasting was awful. (I'm sorry to say but we were served some scary bar out of cereal and dense pudding, both were not matching all the prior dishes we had)We ordered additional dessert "Baked Hawaiian" and that was delicious and light.

We were here for a business dinner - apparently this is a very popular place and people are having a hard time making reservations. Good thing we found a slot.The restaurant is not that big - 5 of us crammed together in a booth, and while it felt a bit crowded, it was fine. Nice decor overall - and while this place has a Hawaiian theme, I found it interesting that the only place you'll hear any Hawaiian music was in the bathroom.We started with the tuna poke - very good! I loved the presentation on the nori.Yellowtail sashimi was very good, the dungeness crab wonderful. By the way, all of these things were made to be shared among the 5 of us, and not as individual plates.The tuna belly misoyaki was excellent, and the manila clams with curry sauce was fantastic. Roasted octopus tasted good, and the fried rice with spam was a guilty pleasure. We also had the opah and the short rib. I am not a big fan of short ribs, so I can't comment on whether it was good or not, but the opah was definitely tasty. This is not a fancy place - I think we were the only ones wearing our jackets. We sat just next to where the open kitchen is, so I got to see them in action. Overall, it's definitely a great place to bring friends or have a fun dinner for business. Keep in mind that the more people you have in the group, the more you'll get to try out. I'd say assume about $100 a person in terms of cost. I'll definitely go there again.

Great modern Hawaiian Food ala Alan Wong

Hawaiian food exists in two genres, the starchy post-World Way plates full of cold macaroni salad, rice, Spam and taro---calories, calories, calories--producing the modern island physique which can barely fit into XXXXL t-shirts, and then there is the haute cuisine variety that exists mainly in the tourist restaurants and was first popularized, or "invented," by the likes of Roy Yamaguchi, Alan Wong and Jean Marie Josselin, to name three, and has been improved upon by the next generation of cooks. This second cuisine variety is respectful of fresh ingredients and modern cooking techniques while not ignoring the cultural history of the islands. Fusion is the modus here and in the best hands make for spectacular cooking. Alan Wong probably took it to its highest levels, no doubt helped by his long apprenticeship in New York City in the kitchens of Lutece. The chefs at Liholiho are are masters of the same art and produce delicious, flavorful plates of the best and freshest ingredients that can be obtained.Top tier San Francisco dining has risen to an almost obscene level of expense. Not being in the kitchens nor looking at the bills can one criticize the charges, but $300-400 is a lot to pay per person for dinner before one even adds the tip, tax and beverage charges. Liholiho satisfies on every level and it is entirely possible to leave here with great memories of the meal and a big smile on one's face for less than $100 per person, so go and explore the menu. Poke is a whole new experience here, not the sesame oil, salty soy impregnated bastardization served everywhere else, but a delicately flavored fish course with uber sushi grade fish and served on a delicious nori cracker. Place an order to go to enjoy later at home. Opah one night was terrific, same for the roasted asparagus course. Duck liver toast tastes like foie gras so sin and enjoy it!This is a great place. Just too bad it is so popular, but good for them. They deserve it.

An Extraordinary San Francisco Dining Experience!

A truly extraordinary dining experience awaits you at Liholiho Yacht Club in San Francisco. No, this is not a sponsored review nor am I compensated in any way for my raving review, other than the privilege of being able to patronize this establishment as a Bay Area resident, just like you can. For starters don't be misled by references to this being a Hawaiian or "Hawaiian inspired" eatery because other than spam being an ingredient on one of the fabulous first courses, there is no resemblance. That's right- S P A M. My first experience here was remarkable and unplanned-we were included at the last minute on a group reservation for the Ohana Table venue, which is a prix fixe offering for groups of up to 10 lucky diners to sample a family style dinner of many courses. Appetizers included sashimi creations, seared spam on toast points, a terrine of some sort and other delights; memorable main courses included the Cornish game hens, roasted beef ribs, an incredible dish of manila clams in coconut curry sauce, and twice cooked pork belly. I'm not a dessert person but there were three or four varieties and they all went quickly. In a word, the entire experience was FANTASTIC. I should also add that I have acquired a taste for different whiskeys of the world including some of the wonderful but hard to find Japanese whiskeys from the Suntory and Nikka distilleries. If you share my affinity for the less smoky but equally complex Japanese counterparts to Scotch and Irish whiskeys you may never leave this restaurant-the list of spirits includes some very exclusive drams including the Nikka Miyagikyo NAS, 12 and 15-all outstanding in my opinion if you like Speyside style scotch. The only other place in SF that has a comparable selection is the Nihon Whisky Lounge. So in conclusion if you want a truly memorable dining experience and can coordinate with a group of your friends, make a reservation for the Ohana Table at Liholiho Yacht Club. Be prepared to wait, and to be very glad you did.

Lovely meal starting with tasty popcorn, the Tuna Poke was our favorite appetizer fresh and flavorful. The cow tongue in poppy seed steam bun with Kim Chee was tender and the thickness of the tongue was perfect as this seemed to be an issue in other reviews. We also had duck liver toast with pineapple, we were surprised by it being a warm dish, but that complemented the flavors, a little goes a long way. Another favorite was the eggplant Katsu, perfectly fried while maintaining tenderness of eggplant. For mains we had short ribs, the side of twice baked potato with bone marrow which outshone the ribs. The Opah was dry, but the butter beans and cabbage were great and the twice cooked pork belly with kumquats was yummy but may have been better served with the rice on the plate. Service was good, atmosphere pleasing but loud for conversation. Would go back with new friends to try other menu items. Overall enjoyable night. 

So glad we got to eat here!

I have been wanting to try this place after reading about it's opening in January 2015. And because I ended up living overseas for a bit, I have not had the opportunity and quite frankly forgot about it. So seeing someone checking in on Yelp joggled my desire once again. Well, I'm home, snagged a 7:30 dinner table reservation, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food was really spectacular. Plus being seated in front of the open kitchen watching Chef Kapur work the kitchen was a real treat. Liholiho was much more spacious than I had anticipated - a counter bar in the front with smaller tables along the wall and a larger community table. Kitchen in the middle of the space and more dining tables all the way back, so pretty spacious. A smaller cocktail bar is located downstairs in the same restaurant operated under the name of "Louie's Gen-Gen Room". Gotta come back to try it one day. Ordered way too much food for dinner despite the waiter's suggestion to hold back a bit, but we were in surrender mode and lack of control got the best of us. The food was amazingly good ... probably because it's mostly Hawaiian-inspired. What's not to like about the Hawaiian islands right? Highlights were the tuna poke on nori chip. This is the first time I recall ever having a nori chip. Worked great with the poke and enjoyed the contrast in textures. The grilled short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth onolicious! Another first for me was the off-menu house-made spam (a.k.a. deconstructed Spam musubi). Definitely tasty and not as sodium-ladened (amongst other chemicals & things) as the supermarket canned version. Healthy? far from it. Healthier choice? sure. Everything was delicious and clearly showed a lot of creativity and care in making the dishes, but that baked Hawaii ... wow, simply stunning. I don't know what made me happier - its arrival signaling the end of dinner dishes (belt looses a notch), or getting to enjoy something so beautiful and tasty looking. Most likely both. A couple of times the station chefs were proud to deliver their creations to our table themselves, adding nice narratives to the ingredients in the dishes. Service was top-notched with what seemed like everyone on the dining floor coming by our table at least once. Liholiho is a great place to enjoy some ono grindz, talk story, and get jag!

The decor is modern and spare, clean-lines but not cold. There's definitely a fun "up" feeling among the young people here (we were among the oldest diners among many, many "date nights"). Our waitress, Page, was friendly and professional. The food is an unusual combination of homey, comfort food mixed with interesting, freshly prepared in-season ingredients. This is the type of place we really enjoy, absolutely wonderful food in a casual atmosphere. Note: We got our table reservation by being on the wait list, so keep trying!

Did;t manage to get a table in the restaurant but did book a table in the cocktail bar Louie's gen gen room. Amazing service, wonderful cocktails. It's a cool bar that makes you feel like you are somewhere tropical. Of course it was winter and it was cold but it's like stepping into another world. I loved it! Be aware you need to book at table just for a cocktail too!

We arrived 5 minutes prior to our reserved time. But we soon learnt that the list of reservation policies which includes a max of 15 minutes hold time if you were late apply to the customer but not them. We ended up waiting for 35 minutes for the table we reserved. Don't understand why.Thankfully, we had a great waiter and the food lived up to its reputation. Must tries are the tuna poke, beef tongue and fried rice. Such an explosion of beautiful flavours which we washed down with sake. By the time we ate the first dish, the earlier frustrated had evaporated. I just hope a little more attention is put on how reservations are managed. Great food and service come hand in hand.

We made reservations before Ravi was selected Chef of the Year by Saucy. Our group of 8 shared a meal st the Ohana table and the experience continues to excite. The cocktails changed a bit but reminds pretty much the same as the Bitter End continues to be my fav. The prix fixe meal included tuna poke on a nori cracker, fried oysters on lettuce and topped with beef carpaccio, iceberg lettuce with beets with a furikake crunch and marinated squid with crispy tripe, cabbage and topped with peanuts.Main courses include clams cooked in a coconut curry and served with naan, fried Cornish game he topped with fried broccoli, kale, cashews and a glaze which is still my favorite dish. We finished with country pork steak with cranberry beans and mustard seeds. The pork was super tender both because it was cooked perfectly and brined.For dessert we had coconut butter mocha and a panna cotta. We added some baked hawaiis just because it is my favorite dessert here.Must try includes the pork steak and of course the baked Hawaii. The place is still crowded but not jammed packed for a Thursday nite. That said, we still can't get a table at a reasonable time unless we round up a group of 8 to take down the Ohana table.Love this place, it still rocks...

Well, I have to admit that we couldn't get a reservation but we were able to get a spot at the bar so that we could try a few dishes. I think my favorite was the Beef Tongue in a poppy seed steam bun....really delicious to share (there's 2). Also was impressed with the tuna poke on a nori cracker...I want to go back again and again and try it all! Everything we saw looked amazing

We had dinner with friends at this place. Pretty big, modern mixed with retro Hawaiian the place is full on with good chique. The table we got was quite small but not too bad for 4 normal size adults. The highlight is the food. It was a celebration for the taste buds. We had the popcorn which someone grow up on you and you can't stop until it is done, the Tune poke that was very good and delicate, the eggplant that in my opinion was the best I had (and I know my eggplants), the Opha fish that was amazing, the Hen that was soft and tender with an amazing salad and the fried rice with shrimp and scallops that was (again...) the best fried rice I had. To be honest, I don't recall the last time I've been in a place that every dish is perfect++ Well done to the chef that managed to push the boundaries that far. Service was excellent as well and all in all, if you have a special occasion or if you want to impress someone, this is your place.

I recall the food was good, but even better was the fact that they played hip hop from the chef's playlist. We learned this because he came out to ask how everything was--always a bonus to meet the man(or woman) behind the cuisine. Cool decor too--gorgeous pic of chef's mom in Hawaii blown up as wall paper. Being from Minnesota, we have no places like this at home.

The food and service at this restaurant is second to none in San Francisco. We booked a month in advance. This is the earliest that they will take a booking but it is worth it.We had the Tuna Poke which was one of the best dishes we have ever had for texture and flavours.Mussel coconut curry is a must or the fried rice with shrimp. Both are amazing.This is my second visit to San Francisco and my second visit to Liholiho and I will always visit when I am in the city. I travelled for 10 Hours from Europe and this was my first choice.Its close to Union square with good travel connections.Many walk-ins were turned away on a Saturday night and its worth booking in advance.

I had heard good things about this place, and went in with high expectations. Somehow, it still managed to exceed those expectations. First we tried some of their cocktails, and they were each impeccable, and perfectly balanced. As we moved through the menu, every single dish was both unique and exquisite. You'll find combinations you've never seen before and each one will be done extraordinarily well. I was with a group of four and we all passed around each other's dishes...we probably got through half the menu and didn't want to stop because everything was so good.The big surprise to me, though, was the size of the dishes. When I go to a place rated this highly with an eclectic menu, I expect tiny portions at an expensive price that don't do a thing to fill me up. This place actually gives you a real meal, and the prices are great for the outstanding quality you're getting. If I lived in San Francisco and could afford it, I would eat here every day. Do yourself a favor and go here, you'll love it.

Yes, this place met all the hype and more. We expected to be amazed given how damn hard it was to get a reservation and we were more than happy. They blend taste, texture, aroma and appearance to make amazing dishes. It started with very good martinis and eventually a nice selection of wines-we got a bottle of rose with the apps and a nice red with dinner. We shared the crispy Maine lobster, beef tongue and Poke. All three were great fusions that worked in ways that surprised and delighted our group. The lobster melded crispy and savory in an unexpected and very good way. The game hen was a hit as was the slab of beef ribs with the right amount of spice and sweet and sour. Save room for dessert-we shared all four from the Baked Hawaii to stone fruit pop tart to the chocolate peanut butter brownie with miso. I now know why Liholiho is on the list of the must eat places of 2016.

Typically billed as a Hawaiian restaurant, Liloliho is more a fusion restaurant with Korean, Indian, and Californian influenced dishes. It's heavy on the seafood, but even our non-seafood dishes were excellent. Eat: tuna poke, duck liver toast, manila clams in coconut curry, grilled shortrib, fried cornish game hen, and the baked hawaii.

Liholiho is a lovely spot downtown San Francisco, vibrant atmosphere and in my opinion some great music (funky 70's) with seamless service and unique, flavorful and fresh food. I'm not a big fan of open kitchens as I've seen and heard some pretty horrible actions in the past but this kitchen was a joy with everyone focused, doing their jobs with the chef overseeing and he must have taught them well as there was minimal interaction. They are very busy so this was remarkable to see, when they had a lull it was smiles! Never seen that in an open kitchen before.Each dish was very distinct with their own style, flavor and texture and is delectable. Service was incredible as it is a "team" effort with on occasion a dish will be presented by one of the kitchen staff which was very nice to receive hot off the stove. Interesting cocktails, nice wine by the glass list and bottles. They do have a swell underground reservations only bar with Lighter fare. Management team has done an excellent job putting this place together and I observed they are not above cleaning a spill. All in all I think a great place to dress up or be casual, nice pre or post theater, date night or special celebration.I will look forward to returning to LihoLiho again soon.

This was our most anticipated dinner reservation of a long West Coast trip. It was not what I expected at all. First- has to be toughest reservation in town at the moment - 30 day advance on Yelp reservations only- no Open Table. The cuisine is Asian Fusion with Hawaiian influence. The Opah dish was fantastic and a stand out. Dessert and small plates were so-so- was hoping to have doors blown off from menu descriptions. Service was fine, but a bit hectic. Vibe is definitely loud bar scene/Millennial Meat Market (or Hemp Market- LOL). Small space and lots of folks crowding in around bar, standing very close to tables. Reminded me of Girl and Goat Chicago a few years back- the scene... Need a "Messenger Bag" and some pencil jeans to fully enjoy the experience. :-)

My wife went to Liholiho rectently with some friends because it has been getting so much good press. While we enjoyed our meal, we're not sure what all the fuss was about.The best dishes we had were the poke on a nori cracker, which balanced texture between the crispy deep-fried cracker and the tuna; fried Guinea game hen, which had a flavorful sauce and deliciouS fried broccoli and kale; and the marinated squid, which balanced favors perfectly with salty olives and crispy potatoes. We were less enamored of the short ribs, which simply lacked flavor, and the marinated squid, which was overwhelmed by an abundance of cabbage. The beef tongue in a steam bun had potential but the kimchi dominated the surprisingly delicate beef tongue. We liked the kimchi and bun, but the dish needed a different meat or more of the tongue.Service was friendly, and the restaurant had a very reasonable noise level. But think all the 5 star reviews represent a bit of grade inflation. Liholiho was very good -- and, importantly, unique within San Francisco -- but it was far from one of the best restaurants I have been to in the city.

I've been looking forward to visiting this place since it opened, but its popularity made it hard to get a reservation. A friend and I took a chance and met there just after they opened in the evening scoring seats at the bar. (You can eat a full meal at the bar.) The bartender, Erik, was great. He stepped me through the profile of the cocktails and gave me tips on how to navigate the menu.Sitting at the bar we could see many choices beyond those we made. The entrees were huge and looked delicious, perfect for sharing. We swooned over the hen, presented liked a delicious pile of fried chicken with an equally huge pile of dressed broccoli. We also say delicious looking ribs and corn on the cob. Both sets of diners loved these entrees.We sampled four different cocktails between the two of us and they were all well-balances, some more savory, some sweet, depending on your preference. We then ate from the snacks and first course items. The poke was really good. This restaurant has a vaguely hawaiian theme, so assumed there would be good fish options, esp poke and we weren't dissappointed. The sleeper hit for us was the tongue buns (yes, beef tongue!) Don't judge, just eat it. It was so, so good. The bun was soft with a poppy seed crust, the tongue was tender and layered with a mild kimchi. Delicious!We also had a great raw tuna preparation, that was as pretty as it was tasty. We also enjoyed the manilla clam curry. The curry was a brothy coconut and tumeric base and was very flavorful. Instead of rice it was served with delicious homeade naan. Yum!We're not big dessert people but tried the pineapple meringue item. It was an interesting tropical variation on a baked alaska - pineapple ice cream on a simple sponge, covered in toasted meringue and garnished with coconut and pineapple. It was very attractive and very sweet (obviously). If you have a sweet tooth, go for it.Plan ahead and check it out. I understand the downstairs bar is now open and is fun too, with more tasty drinks and bar snacks.

Had dinner on Tuesday, Aug 2. We were seated immediately in the back room, right across the kitchen. This turned out to be interesting, but did not improve the quality of the food.We started with the "tuna poke", quite well done but could be better with some avocado. The next two courses were the "duck liver" and "beef tongue" which looked okay but two much bread. Our salad was the "beets and radicchio" which we found to be too little beets and too much radicchio.Our entrees were the "grilled short ribs" and the "fried Cornish game hen". The ribs were lean, tender and tasty - the best overall dish for the evening. The hen was a little over dried and dry. It came with fried kale and broccoli, which were very oily. It would have been better had they drained the oil from the vegetables.For dessert, we had the "baked Hawaii" which was similar to the 'baked Alaska' but with a pineapple emphasis.Our tab for the evening for four came to about $200, without any wine.Would we go back again? Probably 'not'. We experienced the 'fusion' flavor, but we can find better tasting food elsewhere. But, we recommend others should try it, at least once.

We arrived at opening time only to hear that all reservations were taken, but we were welcome to be added to the wait list. Unfortunately, we didn't have a US cell number, therefore we were unable to leave as the restaurant wouldn't be able to contact us (i understand they will usually text/call when a table becomes available). However, this turned out to be for the best as we were able to visit the newly opened bar downstairs. The cocktails were great, as was the jerky we had. The bar had a great ambience and felt chilled in comparison to the bustling restaurant upstairs. When a table became available (after around 1hour 45 mins) the service was attentive. The menu was a little confusing, but the server explained it (which was useful, otherwise we'd have ordered far too much!). Turns out many of the dishes towards the bottom of the menu are for 2 people - basically the lower down the menu you get, the more food you get! We had beef tongue with kimchi in a steamed poppy seed bun to start, followed by twice cooked pork belly with pineapple and fried rice with spam, shrimp and abalone mushrooms. All the food was fantastic (although my other half thought the pork a little too sweet) and we left very satisfied. Only improvement would be more seating/expansion as the restaurant seemed very popular for a mid-week evening and resulted in a noisy setting.

After reading the online hype en masse, I set up an Outlook alert to make a reservation at just the right time to ensure we got a table. Apparently I wasn't alone. Since all tables at reasonable hours were swiped, we took our chances at the bar. We showed up relatively early at 6:00, and, again, we weren't alone. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes to get a spot at the bar, which is not a problem when it involves a glass of wine and snack. (The bartender was great. The togorashi popcorn was bland.) The problem with waiting at Liholiho is that there is hardly any standing room. We were breathing down people's necks. Awkward for everyone involved. We asked the hostesses if they could simply grab us when two seats become available out of respect for others' personal space. They were no help, and the uncomfortable bird dogging continued.While waiting, we received recommendations from another guest who had eaten at Liholiho three times. As soon as we set down, we ordered per her recommendations and received dishes pretty quickly. The beef tongue steam buns were so tough that I can't even recall the flavor. The poke (my favorite) was salty and satisfying, but not extraordinary. The duck toast was the same. As was the softshell crab. The homemade spam fried rice, ditto. Moral of the story, everything appealed to my salt tooth but nothing seemed worthy of all the online praise. That goes for the atmosphere, as well. It's a casual, nice little place, best enjoyed at a table rather than the bar. I just can't understand why everyone is freaking out over it.

A new kid on the block with understandably long waiting lists and a very good looking crowd. Liholiho is probably one of the hottest new restaurants in a city that's no stranger to hot restaurants. What really won me over here was the service and the cocktails. The staff are exceedingly friendly, knowledgeable and eager to walk you through the menu and the beverage offerings. There were 5 of us, and we all ordered the repeat of the cocktails, which were in keeping with the Hawaiian theme, albeit with several levels of refinement (not big coconut, funny glassware, pina colada types) We had the octopus which was cooked extremely well, though the accompaniments seemed out of sync. An asparagus with a hollandaise of some sort which was nice, lobster and avocado - okay at best and a really stunning steak on toast done medium rare. The menu is a little experimental, in a good way, the kitchen live - and everyone really seems to be into what they're doing. I look forward to visiting again and seeing the new stuff they come up with.

Heather at the bar was fantastic, and walked me through the whole menu plus local draft selections. I chose the Cornish game hen and it did NOT disappoint - including the broccoli and kale, which were prepared so they literally melted in your mouth. My only regret was that I had no room for desert...so plan accordingly when you go!

Great food, service, cocktails, wine selection, and ambience. This restaurant is great for date night or reserve the Ohana Table for a party of 8 or more, which is what we did. The family-style menu is perfectly portioned and paced; best part is that the menu is set so you just need to sit, relax, and watch the food appear. Finding street parking is difficult but there is a parking garage across the street and the Sutter Parking Garage a few blocks away. The servers are pleasant and friendly.

Liholiho was an unexpected find near our hotel on Nob Hill. We started with seasoned popcorn (yes, that's right!) for an appetizer, and it was wonderful! I had a lovely rum cocktail, which had the surprising addition of a smoky flavor instead of the usual sweet, stickiness. It went incredibly well with our popcorn and the main course, which we shared. This was a lovely 1-1/2 lb. salmon tail, cooked in a light tomato sauce with vegetables, featuring fresh locally grown asparagus. It was plenty for the 2 of us! Don't let the prices scare you-the portions are big enough to share! We took home a piece of their chocolate-rum cake for later, and it was one of the best desserts we'd ever eaten. I highly recommend this unusual restaurant, especially for adventurous eaters who want to try something other than the usual seafood or oriental menu.

I first decided to try Liholiho on the very day Chef Ravi Kapur was recognized by Food & Wine magazine. What a culinary trip. The restaurant is sleek with a very modern feel. And yet, the entire scene exudes warmth: from the friendly hostesses and bar staff, to the patrons. The vibe is fresh and authentic all around, and there is no cheesy tiki/hula decor. The bar selection is creative and based on fresh ingredients with top shelf liquors. I dined at the bar (solo) and enjoyed the company of the surrounding guests and the bar staff. My bartender offered several excellent recommendations. The fava bean and horseradish appetizer was incredible and fresh. The tuna poke was wild and so fresh. Loved it. The oyster and carpaccio salad was an incredible mix of flavors and all of the textures were perfect. The bartender offered me half portions since I was dining by myself. The highlight of my dinner was the baked Hawaii. YUM. Single-handedly the best dessert I have enjoyed in years. The space is a bit tight but accommodating for all group sizes. The front tables can be put together for larger parties. I will definitely be returning this month. Don't miss it.

A restaurant can rarely live up to the hype already heaped on Liholiho, but this one does. First off, the restaurant is fairly small and reservations are almost impossible to come by. We took a chance and showed up at 4:45 on a Tuesday and were able to score bar seats. The menu is divided into basically 3 sections. Sort of small, medium and large. We shared three small and three medium and it was almost too much food. The food is thoughtful. By that I mean the pairings of local ingredients and international cultures is well thought out. Everything we had was really, really good. Equally great was the service. Our bartender/server, Joe was also thoughtful in his answers to our many questions. He really knew his stuff, from ingredients to wine. It was very impressive. We can't wait to go back again.
