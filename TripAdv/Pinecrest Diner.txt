Initial signs were good with a constant queue outside.Being visitors from Scotland the experience was good sitting at the bar watching the food being cooked.However, the food itself was pretty ordinary & definitely over catered for.Service was far from good....we were effectively being ignored.Definitely only a one off experience.

Bring your appetite . . . the owners are Greek so the plates are piled high. All the staple diner foods plus some extras. They do a terrific egg white omlette so don't be afraid to ask. Coffee cups are typical diner size so you will be out of coffee after a few sips but they are quick on the refills. Casual, no frills, but good breakfast option.

We ate here twice for breakfast and once for our evening meal whilst in San Francisco. Thought the food was good especially for breakfast and the service was good too and quick bringing the food. Advice is to get there early. We were there around 7.15 the first couple of days and it was busy then. On our last morning we were a little later and the queue was way out of the door so we went across the road to eat instead as we were a little short on time. I'd definately recommend this place for breakfast though.

No meatloaf

What kind of diner doesn't serve meatloaf?: this place. Chicken fried steak was thin and a bit tough, luke warm mashed potatoes, and not so hot coffee. The chocolate cake was tasty. Supposedly one of the top 20 diners in the U.S. It's a mystery how it got this far up the list. Dinner at 7pm and they were already out of baked potatoes. Egads.

The Pinecrest Diner is a typical diner centrally located in downtown San Francisco. It is very busy - expect a waiting line - but it moves. They have a large menu - with a wide variety of typical breakfast selections - good quality & large portions. The service is efficient.

Good food served here. If you are planning to go here for breakfast, make sure that you get here as early as possible. Otherwise, you will have to wait as there is a long queue outside this establishment. Free flow of coffee here and definitely not a place for you to just hang out for a long time.

Disappointed about service, food was okay

I just returned from breakfast at the diner and it was definitely not a great experience.Really bad service once the waitress ignored my complaint that the bill was incorrect (and it clearly was). 5 minutes later I had to remind her again that I had requested to pay and that I am not willing to pay the 3 dollars extra. I paid the original amount (being the correct bill with 12% tip). I did not get any "thank you", instead just a smart remark not to leave the last dime that she had returned with the bill.The food was really okay, but the bad service overshadowed it. Luckily there is at least one better Coffee House at 5 min walk distance.

This used to be a reasonable place to go for moderately priced average diner food, however after my experience tonight I will hever go again. I ordered a rueben sandwich and after waiting around 20 minutes was presented with what was basically a saurkraut sandwich with a couple thin slices of meat. When I queried this as compared with the meat stacked photo in the menu, the waiter took my plate and saidI "get the f out of here". Seriously!!

Have you ever tried getting a table in San Francisco at around 8-9 pm on a Sunday evening? I did, and it's bad! I was walking by close to the Hotel I was staying in, not 4 blocks away from Union Square when I just saw this place and there was just a 3 people long line. Every other place I've seen (other than Mc Donalds) had a huge line, more than 10-15 people waiting to get a seat. I was tired and hungry, so I formed-up there and waited. Took me around 7 minutes to find a place at the bar facing the kitchen. The grill was in front of me. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger w/ fries, no pickles. Some 10' after, I was eating it. Good stuff, though the patty was kind of flat. I ordered it well done and it came with more pink than I'd normally care for but I was famished. The cook is amazing though. He goes back and forth and prepares at least 5 to 7 plates at the same time and the guys helping him do not seem to be as good as him. He is a bit messy but clean. I didn't appreciate him arranging the fries on my plate with his bare hand though.Price was good, food was good. Nothing spectacular to report or remember.

Much better than I expected. I was expecting greasy spoon, poorly cooked, over salted... Instead it was the exact opposite. Inexpensive. Open 24 hours, so at 8:30am eastern (5:30am pacific) they were open and with available seats. (It does look harder to get a seat later in the day.) Don't get me wrong: this is basic food; I don't think Eggs Florentine is on the menu...

The Pinecrest Diner was located on block from our hotel so on a Sunday morning at 8:00am we joined the queue on the footpath to await access to have have breakfast. The place was already packed however we waited only a few minutes before space became available. There is seating for about 100 people in booths and a couple of tables as well as at the counter. We were asked if we would mind sitting up at the counter. Our orders were taken fairly quickly by a friendly waitress. Coffee arrived quickly. Whilst waiting for our meals to arrive we had ample time to observe the intense activity in the kitchen area. We could see one person concentrating of washing plates and delivering them back ready for use. One cook focused solely on cooking eggs, omelettes, pancakes, waffles etc while another cook concentrated on preparing bacon, sausages, ham, steaks, hash browns, fries and garnishes.A waitress took orders, cooked toast, delivered meals and accounts. Another worked the phone and cash register as well as doing other things. Someone else was cleaning tables and permitting admittance to new patrons.There was a constant frenzy of activity but all staff worked effectively together like a well oiled machine.All food prepared appeared to be of a good quality. The menu offered a wide selection of food ensuring something to satisfy all tastes.Our meals were of generous proportions and had good flavour and texture. Presentation was good.We enjoyed this dining experience and felt we received good value for money.

Stayed at a hotel down the street and saw that this place seemed popular and recommended. Sure enough, it had about a 20 minute line-up, at around 830AM on a Friday in August. My wife and I got a booth and ordered the waffles and french toast, along with coffees. At the end of the day, it was what we ordered - nothing more or nothing less. The service was prompt. The furniture did show signs of wear and given the high volume of traffic.

There was always a queue outside this diner in the morning so I assumed it must be fairly good. The first couple of mornings we didn't wait as we were in a hurry. However we did go back a few days later at around 10.30am and there was no queue. There was an extensive menu for breakfast as well as dinners, sandwiches etc. The portions were massive. I can recommend the corned beef hash as well as the pinecrest breakfast. Definitely worth the wait if there is a queue outside. I like the fact that it is a typical old fashioned diner with no gimmicks and you can see them cooking the food. Service was good too.

My friends and I had dinner there and all staff members including the manager were incredibly rude to us. I ordered the soup of the day (which is ready made thereby it should not take long) and my friend ordered pasta. She got her food and I asked where mine was. They ignored me and walked away. When my friend nearly finished her food I asked the waiter for mine again. He put my soup in a tiny salad sauce bowl and another staff member had to remind him that he used the wrong bowl. When we paid I mentioned this incident to the manager who didn't even look at me as I was talking to her. I told her that I would pay full price but want them to apologise as I waited over half an hour for my food. She called me a liar in my face, did not apologise and according to her it is perfectly fine if people that sat at the same table get their food at different times. I myself work in hospitality too and I find this kind of behaviour unacceptable. However, the food was fairly nice I would not recommend this place at all.

Sometimes there was a wait but we went twice and only waited a few minutes. We saw other times where the line was quite long. It's worth a 15 minute wait for sure. Once in you're greeted by friendly employees and fast service. The menu is big and they are open 24 hours a day so they serve breakfast all day but I think they only serve the dinner specials from 5-10 pm. I had an omelette with hash browns and sour dough toast one day and the Bleu Burger with coleslaw at another meal. Both were large portions and very good. Planning on going again in the morning, our last day, if it's not too busy.

I had read the reviews online and was expecting queues even early in the morning. It was a Sunday at 7.30am and although I was at the back of the queue I was inside within 5 minutes. Polite, hard working staff. Pleasant and helpful. I was sat at the counter as a solo eater and got to see the operation in progress. I had fresh orange juice (large) sausage bacon toast and hash browns. Everything was good but the hash browns are cooked by the yard. Nothing like I have ever seen before but they were fresh and tasty. Overall a good experience. Reasonably authentic I felt, although lots of tourists there. I would go again and would recommend it to others. Pancakes looked amazing too.

We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and even though the outside wasn't inviting (at first I wondered if it had closed) we chose to eat at the Pinecrest. We were given three seats at the bar and got to watch the guys preparing the food and the waitresses taking orders and serving them. Sorry to be too touristy, but this seemed about as authentic a piece of America as you could find. Reasonable prices, decent food, no nonsense. Friendly, if busy, waitresses who noticed if you needed more coffee. The teamwork in the kitchen was seamless, and if a batch of fries had been hanging around a little too long they didn't think twice about throwing them away to ensure all food was fresh and hot. The food is fine but I'd recommend it if only for the sense of theatre!!

Good diner food at a reasonable price

My son daughter and I ate here for a late dinner. Ww had a turkey burger, blt, pancakes, sweet potato fries and regular fries between our 3 orders. The food ranged from good to very good and the service was very good. My son loved his blt and sweet potato fries and wants to go back.

The menu offered something for everyone in the family, even the picky eaters. Our children enjoyed the chocolate chip pancakes. We loved the coffee and burgers. Excellent service.

My husband and I enjoyed a lovely meal here, the food is great. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The only things that let the place down were 1 - the guy who cleans the tables pointed at the check after we'd been seated for a few minutes after dining, finishing our drinks, as if to rush us out the door and 2 - he also shouted at the waitress in front of the customers, it's a shame as otherwise a very enjoyable experience.

We found Pinecrest by pure chance, walking from our hotel to Union square. Luckily we got the last table and 5 minutes later, there were people making a line to go in ... . Not to wonder! The Pinecrest is a traditional diner that has been serving for many years. Breakfast was great from beginning to end! Very acceptable price and excellent service.

Have to try their breakfast, they are the best!!!!

This place is great for breakfast. It is so good!!! You do have to get there early since the place is small and long lines start to form outside and wait becomes long. We got there both days at around 7 am and we hardly waited for a table. The service is great and quick. If you are in this area this is the place for breakfast!!!!

Finding PINECREST diner was pure luck! we were out for a morning stroll and came across this small place, just steps away from GRAND HYATT union square, and were hooked, and believe me for the rest of our trip around the west coast, we missed it. Excellent selection of food even if your a vegetarian, their portobello sandwich is awesome! everything they serve is fresh and well cooked! their waffles are WOW! Pancakes- finger licking good! SPANISH OMELETTE is my all time favourite. Just make sure you reach early if your going for breakfast, otherwise the waiting is crazy.fortunately its open 24 hours, which is a blessing in the city.If your in San Fran put in the effort to visit this DINER, i know I will be recommending it to all my friends. 

Late Breakfast Spot

We were searching for a spot to have a late breakfast at 11:00 AM. Pinecrest was recommended to us by our concierge as most restaurants end breakfast at 10:30. I believe they serve 24 Hour breakfast. We waited in line about 15 minutes to get a table. Once seated it was clear that this place was an "old faithful" spot for many. The decor, cups, seats, everything is like walking back in time. We both ordered omelettes and the portions were HUGE. Certainly a good deal for the price you pay. The meal was good but not exceptional. Standard big and hearty breakfast menu. We waited a bit for coffee refills and the waitress was running in all directions (but kept a smile on her face and was super polite!). Would I go back? Yes. Would I say this is a "must go to" place in San Fran? No.

Place was busy on a Monday night...wait about 15 minutes for a table, but worth the wait.Blt was good, nice thick cuts of bacon. Clean. Attentive wait staff.

It's a diner. Not a great one, not an aweful one, but a diner.

At this location since forever, the diner served your typical diner foods. Not the book sized menu of the NJ diner but a decent selection of fresh cooked dishes including burgers, pasta, salads etc. And of course breakfast. The food was good, the service sucked but they were very busy and you could tell the wait staff was doing the best they could. The cooks, however were taking it all in stride and this the food was hot, cooked exactly as ordered and delivered promptly. And the prices were very reasonable by San Francisco standards. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd eat there.
