Pat's Cafe was close to our hotel so we went there for breakfast. There were three of us. Staff was friendly and very accomodating. We drink decaf coffee and they made a pot for us right away. My husband and daughter ordered omlets with potatoes and toast. I had 1 egg, bacon, potatoes and toast and we all had coffee. The food was excellent but the $51.00 bill was a suprise. I guess it's a geografic thing. In the midwest that would not be the price.

We stopped for a late lunch. Service was excellent and we were happy to see a number of vegetarian options.I had the Spinach Special which was very filling. DH had the sweet potato wrap. I wanted to get that too, but was afraid it might be too sweet for me (I find plain sweet potatoes to taste candy-like). DH said it was just perfect.Both sandwiches were served with perfectly done fries.

Breakfast at Pat's Cafe was the perfect start for our busy day of sightseeing. It's only a short hop from the Cable Car station at Fisherman's Wharf. Feels very welcoming and homey inside and makes you forget that you're in a crowded city. Staff are very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed oatmeal and pancakes with fruit. Everything including fruit was freshly prepared and most importantly not too sweet (a thing that I'm often afraid of when I'm in the US). Highly recommended!

Near the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's Wharf and a block from the cable car turn around you will find Pat's Cafe. While this seems to be popular with tourists, Pat's seems to draw quite a number of locals. Pat herself is on premise most days, greeting and seating folks. If there is a wait, you sign your name on a lined yellow paper pad -- that's the "reservation system".The food is classic comfort. Pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, and the lot. The wait staff is friendly and prompt, although the kitchen can lag behind on busy days. The walls of the place are decorated by local artists (you can buy certain pieces) and there are two outdoor tables. Every 15 minute or so you are treated to the rattle of a cable car coming past. Unlike places closer to the wharf, Pat's offers a relatively quite ambiance. Some reviewers mentioned that the prices seemed high -- but they are pretty reasonable for San Francisco. It's just more expensive out here!

My first day there was with my husband and he had a sandwich that was very good, nice portions on everything they give. I had a Greek salad and it was to much to eat. The staff was very accommodating. Our friends had the salads also and very pleased. The next morning I had cereal and muffin. the bowl of cereal was way to big and it came with bananas, cranberries and raisins. If I had known I wouldn't have gotten the muffin I asked for chocolate for my milk and they didn't charge extra and coffee was good.

Glad we didn't spend our time waiting on that other line instead!!

Even though we stay near breakfast eateries on Powell Street, it's fun to take the Powell-Mason cable car (when it's not crowded) to Pats Cafe for a delicious breakfast. There are a wide variety of offerings on their menu, and all are tasty and quite filling. If you have a muni pass, you can hop the nearby cable car and proceed back to Union Square... or you can explore more of nearby Fisherman's Wharf.

As an Australian visiting the States for the first time, I was keen to experience an authentic American diner. I chose to visit Pat's Cafe whilst staying in San Francisco, and am so glad I did! The food was delicious - generous servings of good quality produce - and the tea was perfect (not always the case when travelling!). The diner was cosy and inviting, and the owner's paintings of cats adorning the walls added to the ambience. Highly recommended!

Saw good reviews about Pats and thought I would check them out. Another popular place had a line at 11am on a Friday. Didn't feel like waiting. Walked here and was sat down immediately. Wanted something a little spicy and the waiter recommended the Chilaquiles Mexican style. It was close to lunchtime and this had chix and eggs so it sounded good. Let me tell you. It was soooooo good. Highly recommend. Little spicy and the chips gave it a crunch. Never would've ordered this on my own but now I will. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.

They sure didn't mind the guy having his computer spread out taking a table for 4.

Pat's was a few blocks from our hotel and when we looked at the breakfast menu, it was perfect for us. The kids each had a pancake, they shared an order of sausage and one child has scrambled eggs. Pancakes were delicious! Sausage was over cooked , eggs were good. Hubby had a Belgian waffle and biscuits and gravy. I had the corned beef hash. Waffle was yummy...typical waffle. Biscuits and gravy were his favorite, but I thought the gravy was a little sweet for my tastes. The corned beef hash wasn't quite what I expected, but is was so good! The corned beef was cut into half-inch sized cubes and cooked with onions and peppers. Diced potatoes were seasoned very well, 2 eggs cooked well and toast accompanied the hash. I was very, very happy with my order. Service was great and the ambiance was chill for a Saturday morning. We got there about 8:30 and it was pretty quiet but it started to pick up and get a little (lot) busier around 9:15. Would go back, for sure!!

I had seen good reviews of Pat's Cafe in a travel book and eventually found it half by accident after getting on the wrong cable car. It's in a quiet street not far from Washington Square. Had my most enjoyable vegetarian meal of my trip, a spinach, broccoli and feta omelette with small roast potatoes, recommended by David the waiter, along with green tea. We were lucky enough to get a window table as the place was surprisingly quiet. Afterwards I wandered round looking at the artwork and framed photos of Pat's lovely cats. Quirky, homely, welcoming cafe, a happy memory of our trip.

After many impersonal cafes we finally found something that has character and a great vibe , loved the bright colourful walls and the colourful crockery and so happy to find somewhere that served fruit for breakfast . The crepes with fresh fruit were delicious . Husband enjoyed his eggs Benedict. His coffee wasn't strong enough despite asking for an extra shot but the wait staff who were smiling and delightful kindly fixed that for him . We noticed pats as we went past on the cable car near the Fishermans wharf stop . A must visit again place

From the street Pat's Cafe appears to be another average place to catch a meal. Well, step inside and find a bustling cafe with a friendly staff and delicious food offered up in a timely manner. My lunch was that of chicken tacos and a side salad of greens drizzled with the house dressing. My dining partner selected the chicken wrap which was a filling choice with the addition of rice, beans, avocado and sour cream also served with a salad of fresh greens. If going for lunch, go a bit early as we did; the place filled quickly.

We headed into some side streets as the Fisherman's Wharf area was too crowded, noisy and busy for lunch. We were so happy when we stumbled across this little nice cafe, which served excellent food and great drinks. Staff were friendly and service was relatively quick. We had the Greek salad and the BLT sandwich, both of which were absolutely delicious and excellent portions (good value for money!). The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because there was a rather strange smell in the cafe (I'm not sure whether it came from the toilet but it kind of smelled like sewerage.) However, I would still recommend it!

My wife, daughter and I stayed at a hotel down near Fisherman's Warf and wanted to find a place to eat breakfast a little ways away in North Beach. Pat's turned out to be a great find. Only a 5 minute walk from our hotel and no line to get a table. The food we ordered was excellent (french toast, pancakes, breakfast burrito, Eggs Benedict) without the "tourist up charge" you find closer to the warf. Our first experience was so good we went back again for breakfast the next day.

Awsome cafe!

We walked from Jones/O'Farrell to Fishermans Wharf stopping here for breakfast. Excellent menu of American dishes with some having Mexican twist. Accommodated and served well.

Great selection of breakfasts. We ate there several times whilst staying at San Remo hotel and Pat's Bar was the best experince we had in our entire stay in San Francisco. Both the food quality and the service were excellent.
