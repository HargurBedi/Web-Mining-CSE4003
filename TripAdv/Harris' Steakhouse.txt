It was such an all around wonderful upscale experience. Everyone was sooo friendly. From the minute we walked in, we were greeted with a smile. We had a drink at the bar. Everyone was so kind even though it was crowded. The music was lovely. The food was all soooo delicious. The location was easy to find. Drinks were on point. The ambiance was just perfect, quiet yet not uncomfortable. It was all around a lovely experience. No complaints.

We chose Harris for a special birthday celebration on 10-Oct since we were unable to conduct our scheduled Napa trip due to the fires. The Harris wine menu listed a "Far Niente Bella Union Cabernet Sauvignon" which the manager/sommelier asserted was from Far Niente vineyard. We accepted the recommendation given that our Napa trip originally included visiting the Far Niente vineyard for a private tasting. To our surprise, the wine is really from Bella Union vineyard and not from Far Niente vineyard. The label clearly states that it was "founded by the partners of Far Niente" but its a different and separate vineyard. When questioned, the manager was rude and continued to assert that the wine was from Far Niente. It's not. He clearly misrepresented the wine. He then attempted to up sale to a real Far Niente wine but his aggressive and challenging tone adversely affected our celebration. After our dinner, the waiter sent a different (head) manager to our table who offered to remove the wine from the bill. This helped but who needs this attitude and deceptive practice on a special occasion.

Wanted to leave the States with fond memories of the food so looked up the highest rated restaurant we could find. Harris' did not let us down. The steak was absolutely perfect and those scalloped potatoes: excellent! The extensive wine list was a little hard to choose from for an unknowledgeable kiwi but thankfully our waiter Adam advised a good wine and he nailed it. A beautiful Zinfandel to accompany our beef. Sure, it's not cheap and nor should it be. You pay for what you get. Head along if you're ever in San Francisco

Only hubby was a steak-eater but he was very satisfied with his steak. I found my salmon cooked perfect & flavorful.

It's been a long time since I have had food this good. The service was spectacular and the food even better. The shrimp cocktails were massive and so delicious. You never ran out of anything because there was someone there to fulfill your every need. My husband had the bone in ribeye and I had the filet and whole lobster. Clearly my eyes were larger than my stomach!! The lobster Mac and cheese is not to be missed. This is now my new favorite place to eat a steak in San Francisco!!

Friday night. Late booking 9.15 and we wondered whether the staff would have run out of puff by then. Well no they were all fabulous from the hostess, to the bar staff and especially our waiter. Arriving a little early we had pre dinner drinks at the bar in the lounge and enjoyed the opening couple of songs from the jazz trio before moving to our comfortable booth in the dining room. Our waiter was exceptional and even understood our Australian sense of humour. Serving sizes generous as expected and our steaks were both cooked perfectly to order. A lovely last evening in San Francisco. Thank you.

Started drilling down on the reviews and noticed many negatives were from the east coast. Harris' is not a NYC event-type restaurant so there isn't a bunch of bowing and scraping; seat location is not an indicator of your station in life--the whole point is that there is minimal fanfare. This is old-school California dining--you're never rushed. It's not perfect, but it does the classics pretty well. Very much enjoyed the cocktails, steaks, and the wine service. Desserts need work, however. SF restaurant inflation aside, OK value due to high price point. Grab a few steaks from the counter before you get valet service, which is right outside the door.

A classy steakhouse with great food. Not a touristy place like other steakhouses. As expected the service is professional and attentive. The ambience is classic. Steaks and prime rib are excellent. So are the side dishes including the caesar salad. The entrees come with a potato choice and vegetables--so the meal is also filling. The locals like this place which is a recommendation. We will return. [don't sit near the front door on a cold evening]

Nice place, friendly staff,.... but the ribeye was below standard. Some ordered well done, others rare, but everyone got medium (rare) with the excuse that all plates came from the same piece. There are far better places for a good steak with a personal touch.

We were so looking forward to having our last vacation dinner at Harris' after researching and reading the reviews. We take our steak very seriously! When I booked our table 2 weeks ahead, for my wife's birthday, I specifically asked for one of their rounded booths as shown on their website. The gentlemen on the phone confirmed this, and that was that. Upon entering Harris' at exactly our reservation time, the host walked us over to a small 2-seat table beside the wait station. I asked him if we could please sit in one of the 2 empty booths in the centre of the room, as those were the ones I had requested and confirmed in my reservation, and his response was, "those are going to be used for larger parties". Okay, fair enough...I was a bit miffed but it made sense, I guess. Maybe they were annoyed that we had brought our own wine and were not making the ridiculous profit margin on a nice bottle, who knows. So within 5-10 minutes, in walks 2 parties of 2 people, and of course the host seats them in the 2 empty booths that I had pointed out earlier. 10 minutes later, another party of 2 is seated in another recently vacated booth. This pretty much set the tone for the rest of the night. Our server was great, and the food was good (not over-the-top good however), but the attitude and dishonesty was a complete turn-off. In retrospect we should have walked out immediately, but they had already opened our $200 bottle of wine that we had brought for our special night. We love our steakhouses everywhere we travel, but this one gets two thumbs down. We will never set foot here again. Thanks Harris' for the lousy experience.

Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday while visiting San Francisco. It had an "old school" vibe. My husband loved his steak that cost $200.00! That's great since we were there for him. Their French onion soup has no cheese...strange. My steak was not cooked to my liking so I pretty much ate by myself since I had to send it back. In every high end steak house that I've ever dined at, a manager comes over and apologizes. That didn't happen. This restaurant was recommended by the hotel that we were staying at. Probably wouldn't dine there again.

We searched for a great steak and tried Harris. We found the steaks ok but not as good as we have had elsewhere. I asked for a special request and it was confirmed but not delivered. I tried the onion soup which was two thumbs down. The decor was interesting but dated and the service mediocre. On top of that we had an expensive bottle of wine and FOUND two cocktails added to our bill we did not order. Server didn't really care and manager was disingenuous. Never will go back

To be frank, I am not a big fans of Steak. However, I have to be frank that Harris' Steakhouse's steak is one of the best I've ever had. Actually, I prefer the medium one but since I came with my clients for the lunch and they are all Indonesians who are not used to eating medium rare not even medium one, so we all ordered medium well. The presentation looks simple but It tastes really really good. No wonder it has been chosen as one of SF's best steakhouses. I love the interior also. It's classy and classic. If only we came for dinner, we might have enjoyed the jazz performance. However, we really enjoyed the ambiance and the steak. The steak is superb. Two Thumbs up.

Great steakhouse with superb food and service in SF. The decor is very tasteful in downtown SF... Very classic and what I would envision for a steakhouse. All our dishes were cooked to perfection... Delicious! All the salads were wonderful and huge.... We split ours and I would suggest the same, unless you are very hungry. The steaks were all wonderful... Very flavorful and the house au gratin was also very nice. Mark, our server, was very attentive and courteous. If you want a great steak dinner, this is the place for you. Prices are good/average for a steakhouse in major city. Outstanding service! We will return when back in SF.

I'm completely confused at how this restaurant is rated as #13 in San Francisco and one of the top 2 steakhouses. Ambience and "old school" feel is interesting (albeit not as interesting as those in Vegas and Manhattan) and service was friendly but quite honestly, food was sub-par at best. Boring menu, average steaks and desserts that weren't even tempting. Asked a local why it's so popular and he'd never been there which tells me they're better at marketing than cooking steaks. Trust me on this one! I usually rely heavily on TripAdvisor but I can't recommend this one . . .

We sat at the bar as we were a little early and struck up conversation with an interesting local who was eating at the bar.I ordered the Petite Fillet Mignon & my husband had lamb chops. I can honestly say it was the best steak I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection and just melted in my mouth.

Harris' Restaurant, San Francisco I hate giving a review like this, because our server was very nice and the food was what you would expect from a steakhouse where the steaks start at $50 a pop. The manager and host staff have made me never want to return to Harris' again. It's a terrible thing to have a guest be put off with their VERY FIRST encounter with your restaurant, but that's exactly what happened when I checked in and Elise, the manager, told me I could wait in the lounge. I come in, go to the host stand with a big smile and "how are you tonight," to be greeted with nothing short of disdain and contempt. No return smile, no words of welcome, just "I've checked you in and will seat you when the rest of your party arrives. You can wait in the lounge." Um, thanks, but NO. I will sit in the chair opposite the host stand and wait for my party to arrive. As I'm sitting there, another woman arrives. Clearly older than me so I guess, what?, more deserving of the respect all guests should get? When this woman checks in Elise says to her, "would you like to wait at the table for your party?" Seriously??? I'm sitting right there, but I guess she didn't deem me worthy of waiting for my party at a table. So I got up and confronted her with, "do I also have the option of waiting at a table for my party?" What a condescending, rude, woman! She says "let me see if we can do that" before handing menus to the other host. I WILL NEVER AGAIN SPEND MANY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS HERE BECAUSE OF ELISE. When your manager is so rude to your guests that it makes them NOT WANT TO EVER DINE THERE AGAIN, you better reconsider your manager.

If you are hankering for a great steak (or prime rib) in San Francisco, you cannot do better than to pay a visit to Harris' Restaurant at 2100 Van Ness Avenue, in the Pacific Heights district. It's also known as, "Harris' The San Francisco Steakhouse." Located nearby that other popular restaurant (House of Prime Rib), Harris's offers excellent service and quality, without all the tourists. Well, maybe just a few. After all, with top quality service and food, at a reasonable price, word of mouth travels fast, and once you've visited, you're bound to come back. The menu is full, with excellent choices. I heartily recommend the Harris Steak, 12 ounces of 21-day dry-aged, bone-in New York cut that comes perfectly prepared to your order. Included in the price, you will have a choice of potato and fresh, seasonal greens. And I mean fresh! I enjoyed the wonderful sauteed sugar snap peas. The other great 21-day dry-aged steak on the menu, for those who love the benefits of dry-aging, is the 24-ounce Porterhouse steak. A bit much for me. And you won't believe the price on this one. Harris's will also serve your prime rib cuts "English Style," if you prefer. Many people (mostly English) believe the thin slices provide much better flavor. For me, the jury is still out on that issue. But you can decide for yourself. The extensive menu always includes a seafood dish, as well as other types of meat, and all of the "classic" beef preparations. You will also enjoy some fine selections on the "Beginnings" list, including great salads and homemade soups. My clam and mushroom bisque was superb. I must add the wine list (30 pages of excellent selections in all price ranges) is one of the best I've seen. If you feel intimidated by the attempt to choose a wine from a 30-page list, no worries. Jonathan, the sommelier, is happy to help - just let him know the style of wine you prefer and your price range, and leave the rest to him. You won't be disappointed. But, save room for the desserts. The Baked Alaska is to die for, figuratively speaking of course. As is the double chocolate cake. The "Endings" list has ten or more selections - you're sure to find one of your favorites. Valet Parking is available for just $13. But the location is well-served by the Muni and, of course, by Lyft.

Made me feel like I was on a date with my husband. My steak was done absolutely on the spot and arrived pretty quickly. I would definitely come back here if I revisit San Francisco, it really added to my experience of the city. Only downside: the bill. But hey, you knew that before you booked a table.

The atmosphere was on the posh side with loads of locals dressed up fancy for dinner there. Ok if it's your sort of thing but food quality is more important for us and unfortunately we found the food really average and overpriced for what it was. We had smoked salmon n crab cakes for starters and lobster mac n cheese and prime rib. All the dishes were average and the prime rib was tender but tasteless. I did however order a rib eye steak 'to go' for a friend and it smelt amazing, so maybe the steaks are the way to go next time.

I lived in the bay area for 45 years, then moved to Seattle to be near my kids. One of the great experiences was the times we went to Harris's for a great aged steak. The atmosphere was outstanding, the wait people always professional and they made a great martini and did I mention the fact that the steaks are great. In the 6 years since I was last there a lot has changed. The waiters have turned to ordinary and the food has been reduced to something far from even good. How can a steak house cook a steak so thin that a moment of heat would cause it to be over cooked. My medium rare rib eye turned out well done, what happened to the nice inch and a half steak, where did it all go????

Outstanding service, atmosphere and food. I really enjoy the steaks, drinks and hospitality of this long standing SF establishment. Every thing is done to perfection and if in any way you are not pleased, the management and staff will rectify the situation to the best of their ability. Please note, it is on the expensive side but well worth the price. Great for special occasions, a night on the town or a wonderful treat. I usually dine monthly and recommend their prime rib. 

It is always a pleasure to come back to this solid Steakhouse

Although, as i just arrived from Europe and it felt like 2 am in the morning, I enjoyed the marvelous ribeye steak very much. With a glas of red wine it just was as it has to be!I will be back and thank you Harris Steakhouse

Good steakhouse

This is another one of San Francisco's good Steakhouses. The steaks are tender (unless you ask for "well done") and flavorful.

Prime Rib Was Outstanding

We were able to make a reservation here on short notice and that was greatly appreciated. A party of five isn't always the easiest way to go. We were greeted quite nicely upon arrival, taken to our table right away, and enjoyed an excellent meal. Their prime rib was some of the best I've ever had in my life. Service was outstanding. we will go here again without hesitation.

The look is right from central casting for the steakhouse in great movies. It is very comfortable and roomier than many City restaurants we liked that. The service was very good, crisp, professional, helpful, and attentive but not intrusive. Extended family trying to make the best of a difficult reason to get together, especially near the holiday time. The food was deemed excellent by all. The service was also excellent. The experience with family was just what we needed, so why the score of very good? Well, 4 of the family members do not visit Top Quality Steakhouses only what they know as steakhouses (so they had several courses). So, when the bill arrived it looked like a mortgage payment to them. I only mention this as a reminder to be aware- I should have intervened I guess and made them aware. But, we needed time to enjoy the family.

Come here since 20 years, consistent food/meat quality, attentive staff sometimes live jazz. Mot cheap, so with good price/taste relation compared to other upper-level steakhouses. Just the interior gets into early aging.Will come and enjoy again

Easy reservations at open table. We were greeted warmly and shown to our table right away. Cheery Christmas decor. Both the food and service were outstanding. The medium rare ribeye was actually medium rare, as requested. This can be very difficult to find. When we needed little extras like butter or sour cream or bread, they were delivered immediately. Our water glasses never dipped below half full. What more could you ask for?

We arrived about 10 minutes early for our reservation and were told to cool our heels in the bar. As there was no place to sit in the bar we went back to the entrance and sat there for about 20 minutes before they told us our table was ready. Meanwhile I saw that many people who were apparent "walk-ins" were taken to a table as soon as they came in. Not anywhere as gracious as their neighbor down the street, House of Prime Rib.My husband ordered the Filet Mignon, which was rather tough. We get better steak at chains like Ruth's Chris or Morton's. Very disappointed in the quality of the steak. As it was Thanksgiving night I ordered the traditional turkey dinner. The meat was quite carelessly cut, some chunks of meat were inedible because they were full of gristle and bone. My food was tasty, but I couldn't eat a good portion of it.Service was sketchy, pleasant, but not very available. As mentioned earlier the staff at the front desk were less than gracious, very polite, but in-gracious. Price was way over the top for the quality of food and service.

Service was excellent, the old-fashioned atmosphere is great fun (as are the booth seats), I had a very good glass of wine. The steak did not meet expectations, however. We are not big meat eaters and subscribe to a philosophy that if you are going to eat meat, it should be worth it (and not just in terms of cost). And I am not sure that this was. We had two different cuts, neither of which were as fork-tender as they should have been (esp the the filet) and both tasted too strongly of sauce and salt. They were slightly overdone for medium-rare. The mashed potato was on the dry side. So we came away somewhat disappointed.

Great atmosphere - o.k. food

Considering this is a steak house, and not a cheap one at that, the quality of the steaks was fine but not great. We had 2 different cuts and both were not that juicy and bit chewy - although the taste was good. What we really liked was the interior, the place has great atmosphere. Would not go back, though.

My husband and I had dinner here with another couple. We first admired the decor and the feel of the restaurant. We all agreed it had a traditional, old world charm to it. A couple of us had the filet and found it to be very nicely done and cooked perfectly to our individual preferences. The steak itself had a wonderful flavor, yet simplicity to it. I felt the restaurant let the meat "speak for itself" without an overwhelming preparation process. We all "cleaned our plates," and left extremely satisfied! Highly recommend!

One of the best steaks, ever!

We were on vacation, staying in Union Square, where our concierge recommended this steak house. We got a 15 or so minute taxi ride to the restaurant and were soon seated. It was a traditional steakhouse, with a modern feel and a big buzz around the place. It was large, but not so you were lost in the place. It was spacious with lots going on, but equally you felt you had your own space and we felt very happy dining in a side booth just off the main thoroughfare.The menu was large and varied and something for everyone. As we studied the menu a jazz band played up in the dining area next door to us, not too loud, pleasant and adding to the atmosphere. Service was good, friendly and not rushed. We had bread brought over whilst we chose our dinner, and it was not long before our appetisers arrived. Very tasty indeed. Now, I enjoy a decent fillet steak, and have travelled the world and ate in many fine restaurants. You get some poor cuts, you get some half decent and OK meals to eat, some even really nice and tasty. I have to say this steak ranked in our top 5 of over twenty five years of travelling! It was tender, succulent, juicy, just spot on cooked to our liking (med/well) and tasty! We were off to Vegas soon after, and I knew whilst they can have some great steaks, anywhere would have to go a way to beat it (and I was right....!). Side dishes need to be added on separately and it was not a cheap meal to be honest, but in a lively atmosphere, good service, outstanding meal and 10/10 evening, you didn't really mind...luckily!Thanks for a superb meal, highly recommended.

Our last night in San Francisco and we asked for a good steakhouse. Harris' was recommended. We were seated at a small two top. The service was mediocre as was the food. Filets were overdone. There was no bucket to chill our wine. Would not go back.

I wanted to go to a great steak restaurant while visiting San Fran and this restaurant did not meet the expectations. The server had a very difficult time explaining the different cuts in meat. When I asked for Worcester Sauce, he brought me A1. I had to ask for water more than once. The rare steak I ordered was more like rare plus or medium rare. The sides were delicious, though - so I will give them credit there.

We had steak au poivre and it was one of the best steaks ever, anywhere in the world. We paired it with a salad and split all between two lighter-eaters. Wine is a bit pricy but all in all, the bill (a shared entree) came in at about $100. Service excellent and ambiance quite good. We've made reservations already for a re-visit.

My daughter, son-in-law and I had a truly wonderful meal. The steaks and prime rib were cooked to perfection. The creamed spinach was even better than the House of Prime Rib's. Our server was terrific - attentive and cordial. And the valet was a hoot! We will be back!!!

We found this high end steak house just by chance while staying in the Holiday Inn a couple of blocks away.The building is very nicely appointed with dark wood, quality decor and nicely spaced out private dining booths. So private enough for couples, but still with a great ambience. A piano playing in the background and the kitchen pass on view to customers.Steaks were exquisite (but typically American in size) the side dishes were superb and the plates piping hot.We were very well looked after by our waiter.All in all a great dining experience that my Wife and I thoroughly enjoyed. Wine was damn good too.It's not cheap - but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for wherever you are in the world.

Harris' deliver exactly what it promises; a traditional steak house menu with all of the items one would expect. The service is excellent with professional and attentive wait staff who know the menu inside out and who create a relaxed and inviting ambiance. The crab cake appetizer was very good and was big enough to share. The filet mignon was perfectly prepared with a good charred sear that provided a caramelized sweetness to the aged meat. If you like your steak to have that "gamey" intense richness then Harris' is for you! The only minor disappointment was that we were hoping to head to the bar after dinner for drinks and to listen to some jazz. The bar has a substantial amount of seating that was all used for diners and the main bar was busy with no available seating. Overall a very good option if you are looking for a traditional steak house in San Francisco.

Great experience from beginning to end. Steaks were amazing! Service was absolutely fantastic! I loved the cheese spread they served before the meal, but never have we both eaten more perfectly prepared steaks. The char was perfect and consistent over the whole steak's surface and the center was the exact temperature we requested. The scalloped potatoes were a tasty addition to the meal. Our server, Andy, was one of my favorite servers of all time! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Harris' Steakhouse. Unfortunately, it will now be very hard to eat a steak anywhere else when we get home... :(

Our steaks were perfect. As were the au gratin potatoes. The cheese and crackers that were served as we were seated were a nice touch. Service was prompt and professional. My husband had a Manhattan that was served in a little barrel. It's everything a steak house should be.

It certainly won't disappoint those of us that like the traditional style of steak house.Quality fare and attentive service and they make a pretty good dirty martini !!One very strange thing about the menu... there's not one potato dish offered !!!Not one !!! They served gratin dauphinois on our night or jacket but you have to ask !!Caesar salad was as expected, the "prawn" cocktail was lost in the size of plate it was served on ... all of our steaks, filet and rib eye were cooked as asked, and flavorful.

A great night

I come here about once every 6 months or so. I love the old school decor and vibe when you walk in. I prefer the non-piano bar side, but there's an appeal to sitting at a small table by the piano and sipping on a manhattan, too. The caesar salad is legit with the anchovy and not too much dressing. The breaded mushrooms are good, and I'm addicted to the cheese spread that comes with the crostinis (complimentary!). And the wine list is insanely extensive. I highly recommend to anyone who likes a classic steakhouse. There is no way this can disappoint.

Sumptuous leather and wood surrounds with a clubby feel and a nice lounge bar for pre-dinner drinks. The staff are excellent and recommend sensible choices from the massive wine list. Steak is the main play but there are other options.Excellent meats cooked to perfection is what they do here. If you can find room for dessert, after the substantial mains, they sounded delicious but frankly I could not fit them in. Highly recommended if you are looking for that traditional steak house experience
