The restaurant it is located on the 43 Pier. From downtown (where I was) it was quite a walk to get there, and I did it without a problem, one time that it is a very beautiful way, highly recommended.When I got there with my friends, the place was very crowded. The staff was very fast, nice and respectful.We have ordered each one bowl of soup and a big seafood platter to share.The food was awesome, but a little "salty" on my opinion, but well, we are havong seafood so it is kind of "expected".For my surprise, when the big platter came, I could feel the same thing, this "salty" seafood. On my opinion, the mussles were very salty. Not sure if they do not wash properly or what, but it was not the proper taste for sure. I made sure to tell the staff, one time that we spent in three people over 200 USD and it was not worth the money.Great place, nice staff but the "super combo" was more a "very normal combo". I really expected more from a seafood restaurant like this.

Too expensive for what you get!

Decided to order the 2 different chowder bowls at the cafe. There was barely any soup in the bread bowl and way too much bread. We had to throw most of it away only to be picked out of the garbage can by a homeless person a minute later where we sat in the back with a view of Alcatraz. The view in the back of the cafe was awesome with the exception of the constant kitchen garbage disposal by the staff, which I know is necessary, but would be nice not to have to witness if that is possible as these are tables from the cafe offered to eat your food. We decided to have some beignets, tasty but very small size for the money. Coffee was ok and reasonably priced. Overall the experience was disappointing and we will try the street vendors next time. Very friendly staff!

Our party of four was seated immediately at a table with a wonderful view. Service was prompt and the food was wonderful. Three of us had the crab melt sandwich and the other person had the crab ceasar salad. Everything was delicious! I would not only recommend this restaurant but I will return next time I am vacationing in San Francisco.

We had the snottiest waitress service! Went to the host who sat us outside for drinks. The place was slow and we waited about 15 minutes before I went in to flag down the waitress. she brazenly ignored me for a few minutes clearing a table, then slowly turned and said "you'll have to see a hostess to be seated". I said, "thank you, we have been seated and are just looking to order drinks". She stared at me like I wasn't speaking english, then slowly said "ok then. I will be out shortly". She came out and woodenly took our order. Thankfully the wine pour was decent and the sliced yellowtail app was incredibly good. Otherwise I'd say not go.

With the best panoramic views of any restaurant at Fisherman's Wharf and tiered seating that affords excellent sight lines from almost every table , we always took visitors to the Franciscan and recently returned as tourists ourselves. As the interior is now so bright with the vaulted wood ceilings whitewashed, the atmosphere is greatly changed, but the massive picturewindows remain the same. The multi page menu with multiple glossy photographs perhaps is helpful to non-English speaking patrons, but adds to the less elegant feel. The quality of the food remains very good, but more standard fair, less gourmet. The menu focuses on crab and the garlic crab leg platter did honor to the local Dungeness variety. Husband's salmon was a bit over cooked. Service was a bit off as we had to send back our salads as they came before our cocktails arrived. After so many wonderful memories of meals at The Franciscan, we were disappointed with this visit.

Went for dinner on our last night in USA after a three week holiday. Given a great table overlooking the bay and decided to relax with a cocktail before our meal. 1 minute after our cocktail arrived our starters were served. My husband had the chowder so had to start eating while it was hot. Starter plates were whisked away as we finished our last mouthful. Delicious crab linguine for main course but my husband's plate was cleared while I was still eating. There were empty tables nearby and no queue so why rush us through our meal to the point of rudeness? Spoilt what could have been a wonderful evening.

This restaurant is so lovely! It has a great decor and even better food! The waiters are not pushy and let you enjoy your food leisurely. One criticisms are that the food is very pricey, unnecessarily too. When walking back to our hotel we saw another lovely restaurant where the same food options were not as highly priced. This said, the food was divine. I recommend the shrimp cocktail starter and the garlic noodles with crab for a main. The noodles had so much crab it was amazing!One other note, the flooring isn't kept as clean as could be as on the way out one of the people I was with slipped on a prawn and twisted her arm. When we looked at the floor we could see it was covered in grease and food that had fallen of plates going to and from the kitchens.

We enjoyed our meal here but felt $150.00 for three people with only soft drinks was rather expensive for what we ate. Other local restaurants do the clam chowder of similar quality for under $10.00 whereas we paid just under $15.00 here. The crab platters looked amazing but we were only looking for a fairly light meal having just flown in. Our overall experience was diminished when my wife slipped on a greasy patch on the floor and no member of staff came to ask how she was. Thus a feeling of quite high prices but not the attention to detail to match.

The one thing that struck me with this restaurant is that it lives on a golden era's fame when well known artists used to dine here, as the pictures on the wall show.However as we popped in, we discovered to be the only people with a decent dress code, although we just arrived after a short bay cruise. The crowd had anything from hippies with funny hairs and metal on their faces to people in shorts etcOur food was good though although not as varied as at Red Lobster, for example and everything was more expensive despite having a crowd as mentioned above.Our table had a great location right near the window and as usual, I could not finish my food.

Service is poor. It was like a race to get us out the door. Glasses dirty. Starters plates were taken away before everyone was finished. I hadn't even finished my starter and it was taken away. I ordered a small plate crab fondue to go with my crabs legs main and it came with my starter. I thought it was expensive for what it was. Wouldn't recommend any thing we had but the actual venue and staff training.

This is a great place to hang out, have a drink, have dinner and look out at the bay and Alcatraz. We had a party of 12, which they accommodated a little slowly though we had made reservations. They were resistant to seat 7 of us since the entire party had not arrived (due to heavy traffic in the Fisherman's Wharf area - parking can be a strain). I finally explained to them that they were losing money because the longer we waited to be seated the fewer drinks and appetizers we were going to purchase. ;-)Once we were seated, the service was great! The food was excellent! And they had a decent wine selection. The views of the bay were great! And we all had a fabulous time!

Great view of the ocean and Alcatraz. We had the 1/2 shell oysters, seafood cioppino and roasted crab, all were VERY tasty! We LOVE seafood and can tell if it is not fresh, so we are puzzled to see some less than satisfied reviews about the quality of their seafood. We had both cocktails and rose wine, they are excellent. The servers were attentive and very quick. The price is not cheap, but you are expected to pay for high quality seafood and the exceptional service such as what they provide here.

They have quick service. The workers are friendly. The food is good but not cheap in my opinion. We had a whole crab and a portion of calamari frittie. The crab was very nice. It was prepared with butter. The meat was nice and juicy. In Europe, when we ordered calamari frittie, then we'll get batter than calamari itself. At this restaurant, we get more calamari than batter. So it was very nice. That's how is should be, in my opinion. We had window seat. So, when we enjoy our food, we had the view of Alcatraz. It's a nice experience with nice food!

We stopped in for lunch one day and sat outside on the patio. I think we had 3 or 4 different waiters during our visit and couldn't keep track of who was serving us as they kept handing us off. They said they would bring bread but never did. Our glasses sat empty for 10 minutes before we flagged down a waiter and asked for a refill. It took 10 minutes and my husband going inside to get our beer. No apologies ever. The food we ordered was delicious but, as you can tell, the service was very lacking when we were there. We had planned to return for dinner one night but after that experience, decided to go elsewhere. Too bad as the food is good.

Walking up the stairs the walls are covered with photos of celebrities visiting and eating in the restaurant. At the top we were greeted by a wonderful view across the bay and Alcatraz island. We were welcomed by the host shown to a booth for two. The decor was quirky with some nice ocean inspired features, all set in a 50's style. Staff were good, friendly and looked after us. We ordered a fresh salad with crab along with shrimp and mussels from the skillet. It arrived quickly and looked the part. The seafood was ok but no where near as good as we were expecting.We wanted seafood on Fisherman's Wharf and it was a good overall experience. We were happy to pay but the view was definitely included in the price.

We walked into this restaurant on 9/2/2017. Due to the abnormally high temperature in California, it was very hot and uncomfortable in the restaurant. This was ok, but when we ordered water as we sat down, they brought out four glasses of warm water. When we looked at that poor girl who brought them out she said"We ran out of ice, sorry.". Unacceptable. We got right back up and left. On one of the worst days of the year for heat at a very busy time for tourists, How can a manager NOT throw a couple hundred dollars at one of the waiters and tell him "Hop in your car, and go get me as much ice as you can lickety-split!!"? Bad move.

We went to SF on the hottest day on record. Naturally, most restaurants don't have AC, especially on the water. The pluses: we had a 6:30 reservation, got there at 6:05 and they took us immediately. The wait staff, especially Uri, were great, friendly courteous and attentive. It was really too hot to eat much so my wife had a salad and scrimp cocktail. She was very pleased. I had clam chowder and crab cocktail. The crab dish was ok but didn't have much flavor. The clam chowder was fair. I love clam chowder and have had it at six different restaurants in Monterrey. Four of those were better than this one. The clams were rubbery from being cooked too long and the chowder had a sharp vinegar after taste which was unpleasant. Overall, the meal was average at best and at the price, no bargain.

Seated at the window with a view over the bay, the Franciscan was one of our best meals in San Francisco. The crab cakes are amazing - some of the best we've ever had (and we order them whenever they show up on a menu). The crab chowder was very good though the kitchen could lighten up a bit on the thickener (flour?) for my tastes. Also had the roasted Dungeness and the mussels and prawn platter. Everything was in point. Just a great meal from start to finish - and the finish was a hot fudge sundae. Yum.

Came here after a long day on Embarcadero with my wife and two kids. The servers were very attentive to the children and made sure we had plenty of bread and sippy cups of water from the start. The oysters were fresh and succulent and made a great treat for the adults. The abalone dish with pearl couscous and vegetables was outstanding. My wife didn't care so much for the garlic sauce of the Dungeness crab but I quite liked it. Oh and while one normally should not indulge too much in the bread and butter, this place is an exception. The butter is superb. My only criticism is that the Louie salad really isn't worth getting unless you order it with the optional shrimp or crab meat. In my opinion, one or the other should not be an option because otherwise it's just a bunch of lettuce and some onions and not really worth 15 bucks on its own. But this is a very small criticism and overall we were all very satisfied with the place.

After having a walk around the fisherman's wharf area we saw the menu board pricing and displays of food for this place and saw it was cheaper than some of the other restaurants we had walked past offering fish and chips. We ordered the fish fry and chips which comes with battered and fried bits of fish, shrimp, calamari, baby squid and battered seasoned chips. Also ordered a cappuccino seeing as the people at the counter looked Italian so assumed it would be a lovely espresso and foam like I'm used to back in Aus....this is not the case! The espresso or drip coffee used was very bitter and over extracted and the frothed milk wasn't done properly, and didn't even have a dusting of chocolate powder as a finish. I suggest you go with a soda instead.... as for the fish and chips meal it was lovely! From ordering to it being ready was about 5 minutes and none of the seafood was over cooked. The battering they use has some creole flavored spices in it however and could be a tad salty if you aren't a salty chip lover. The chips however were delicious! Much tastier than the ones I've had so far in the States and would definitely re-order that meal should I be in this area again. They also have a little condiments station with malt vinegar, tartare sauce, ketchup, seafood cocktail sauce as well as salt and pepper. All in all for the price, speed of cooking and plentiful seating they provide it is a great quick stop if you're out for the afternoon down at Fisherman's Wharf.

Guess we should've known that any restaurant with a view on the water would be overpriced. We knew the prices and ordered accordingly. We were really looking forward to getting some excellent crab, but it was disappointingly not good. It was dry and fishy. That ended our wanting any more crab while in SF. Too bad, because some of the little street joints would probably have been better. Atmosphere was average. As I said, basically, disappointing. Would not recommend.

We stopped in for lunch. Seated us at a great table with beautiful views of the Bay and Alcatraz. And that was about it. The server was more interested in texting on his phone and checking his iwatch. Took a while to get drinks and even longer to order food. The food is not great. It was put together very sloppily and was cold. The crab sliders were literally thrown together and the calamari didn't seem fresh (I wouldn't be surprised if it came out of a bag). Tried to get our servers attention but again, he was too busy texting. We saw some of the food coming out looking good, but not the case for ours. The main theme of this experience was there was a lack of consistency and a feeling that no one cares what is being served or how it's being served. Very poor.

The Franciscan hangs out over the bay, giving diners a good view of a section of the wharf and of Alcatraz Island. We were there for lunch. They specialize in crab, and my wife had half a crab. She liked it fine and it turned out to be plenty for her. I had the smallest tureen of cioppino, which was plenty for me. There was lots of fish in it--shrimp, octopus, mussels, crab, and a white fish. The sauce was a little too tomatoey and a little underspiced for my taste, but it was fine. Our main problem was that we were put just around a corner, which meant that our server had trouble seeing us. Other than that, it was fine.

The food is very good, the staff is friendly and the view of the bay is awesome. We enjoyed the crab soup and mussels for lunch and were very satisfied. We had evaluated many restaurant choices in the area but selected this one. After our visit, I wouldn't consider anyplace else.

Great dinner

Always good food to be enjoyed at this well known and very popular seafood restaurant where crab is king. Lots of selections to choose from. All entrees are well prepared and properly presented. Wonderful frozen kustard desserts. Wine list and full bar for all your favorite adult beverages. Huge picture windows to view all the activity on San Francisco Bay. Can be very busy so plan accordingly. A little pricey for the size of the portions, but still delicious. Validated parking available. Recommended.

Best on the wharf!

Don't let the name fool you there are lots of options at this restaurant for a quick snack or lunch with a view of the water. We had the garlic fries which lived up to their name and were great and the beignets tasted just like the ones in New Orleans at Cafe du Monde. Pleasant surprise.

Delicious

Great food and drinks and friendly staff who were happy to be there. Fresh oysters, dungeness crab, surprisingly terrific crab enchiladas and Italian sundae to top it all off 

Nice view of the Bay

We visited many restaurants during our week in San Francisco. However, this was the only restaurant that was a little disappointing. The food was good, but not great, and the service was very slow and nonchalant. We didn't feel that we were the priority of our server.

Lunch time away from the crowds

In all the crazy busy area by Fisherman's Wharf, this is just a great place to eat in the daylight with a wonderful view of the Bay.

Very good food and reasonably priced for what you get.

Great seafood. Crab in great variety. Great servce. Graet views of the bay and of Alcatraz. There are binoculars at the tables along the windows for you to use while dining. I would definitely recommend eating here over the smaller open air type of places along the wharf. 

WOWZERS! Eat Here!

Loved the food and the view! Get window seating overlooking the bay and Alcatraz. If it isn't too foggy you can see the Golden Gate. Parking in the central lot is a little expensive, but convenient and easy. 

Excellent seafood. Nice view.

Despite all the noisy tourist stuff going on, this is a remarkably nice restaurant. Great oysters on the half-shell as well as other seafood offerings. A tad pricy, but still good value.

A bit disappointed.

There's a view of the bay from every seat in this restaurant. We stopped in for a late lunch and had a view straight out toward Alcatraz. It was a sunny day so the views of the water and harbor traffic were terrific. We weren't hungry enough to consume one of those enormous crab dishes so shared an order of oysters on the half shell and the crab blinis. Food was good, if expensive. Service excellent.

Good food - great views.

Had lunch where we shared a dozen Oysters and the Bellini Combo of smoked trout, crab, and smoked salmon, washed down with a couple of beers. Excellent oysters, which turned out came from BC, Canada, and the bellinis were great. Nice lunch! Of course the views of the bay, Alcatraz, and all the boats made for an above average setting. Relaxed, friendly, professional service. Not inexpensive, but it is above average for Fisherman's Wharf.

Really good food

This restaurant has delicious seafood. It doesn't lower its standards to cater to the tourists like many of the other seafood restaurants in the area. Pictures of most, if not all the items on the menu helps in picking a meal. 

Excellent views even on a cloudy day, good food

Long time local favorite is still the best eatery on the Wharf. Sitting beside the red and white line dock, this institution is geared towards tourist traffic. There is a gift shop and sandwich shop downstairs for visitors who just want souvenirs and a name check. There is the continuation of the 70 year old restaurant upstairs, lined with movie star black and white framed and autographed pictures. The original bar now also accommodates diners. And many of the booths have been taken out to make room for tables.The food is Italian Seafood oriented. They look great served on plates, or on giant iron skillets/platters for sharing. They taste passable. And the service is pretty good given the crush of diners inside. In addition to the calamari, clam chowder, and crab, there are pastas, steaks, and fish and chips for the kids. There are also a selection of boiled vegetables for the health conscious.The view is still breathtaking. Full on 270 degree view of Alcatraz, with the drama of the fog rolling in from the left. The restaurant is designed so that the view can be enjoyed from just about every table in the house. It's such an important part of the dining experience that it deserves a star by itself.Make reservations. They don't seat you until everyone is there. And don't forget to bring a jacket. It can get chilly if you have to stand in line.

Great view

The adults had a great meal here. The seafood was superb, if a little pricey, and the service was good - once you got a table. It was very busy and we had to wait a while but we then had a great view looking towards Alcatraz. There was even a pair of binoculars to use.This place is not good for kids though. No kids menu, no fries etc. Just one to be aware of.

Pretty pricey, great views of the bay

I came here for a business dinner, so cost wasn't really a factor, but for those considering cost, it's very expensive. Our party of 6 people spent close to $600 after a few drinks, entrees and appetizers. I had the half crab, which was definitely some work to eat, but was overall very tasty. The roasted potatoes and corn were very good. The crab chowder was just ok in my opinion. My favorite thing that I ate there was the italian sundae, vanilla ice cream, olive oil and sea salt. Delicious. The view of the bay and Alcatraz from inside the restaurant is awesome. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I'm not quite sure it's worth the absorbent price tag to eat here.

After being recommended this place for the crab we were not disappointed. Asked for a window seat with my reservation and got an amazing seat with a lovely view of the wharf. The food was delicious and despite it being a bit pricey it was worth the spoil. Loved the atmosphere and food.

What a lovely setting and view. The restuarant resembles the inside of a ship. The view of the bay is amazing. We had crab cakes, calamari and than the shrimp and crab combo. The crab was absolutely amazing. I would skip the shrimp in future. A little to small and oily for my liking. Worth a visit.

We LOVED the crab feast here, best environment for a really good meal in San Francisco as you have the view of the sea and the building is just gorgeous inside. Feels like a bit like you're in an old glamorous diner on a boat, excellent service too. Bit pricey by comparison but totally worth it for the food and the atmosphere. 

For the crabs.

We went here for the famous crabs in San Francisco and we ordered a regular size, the cooking and ingredients were simple but the crabs are very fresh. 3 of us finished in 20 mins and we ordered another jumbo size. Very contained! The restaurant has spectacular view with ocean front and we spent a very pleasant night there.
