After eating in a few other restaurants that were disappointing and expensive, we went for a drink here and decided to stay for dinner. It's was lovely, we came back the following night, we had the chicken curry and the fish and chips. The girl who served us was lovely. The staff are very good. All the dishes looked too. Prices were reasonable for San Francisco and the food good.

Don't do that very often but when you are alone, want to eat an relax this place is a good choice. Had a couple of beers [my choice was a Chimay on tap - not something you find everywhere] with Fish & Chips, watching a NBA play-off game. The staff is real nice and efficient. The food was good and I had the privilege to sit next to a great guy from Mizzou and we had a great conversation around beer and food. No better way to relax after a long stressful day.And the live music was good music on top of the rest. I definitively do not regret that evening!

Came once for a drink and once for dinner. Great atmosphere, with live music at night. The waitress we had was really helpful in helping me work out what I could eat on the menu (dietary), and was really friendly. Was very busy, but there are lots of tables and stools along the wall so we found seats both times. Vegan - had pan fried broccoli to start, and then the veggie stew with french bread. The mash and fried onions have dairy in them so are omitted, but there are sides such as the French bread that you can have instead. I found it over salty but that's just personal preference, and I was just very glad they offered a vegan option.

Johnny Foley's is a large popular Irish pub centrally located in downtown San Francisco. The service is friendly - even a real Irish bartender. They have a nice selection of beers on tap - but a little pricy.

I dropped in without a reservation on Saturday night of fleet week in San Francisco and still managed to snag a table. Kudos!The vibe was great, and the people were awesome. I didn't pay much attention to the sports on the TVs behind the bar, but that seemed to be a big draw as well.The gorgonzola cheese and apple salad was a delicious starter. It was really well-balanced in terms of flavors and textures and really hit the spot after a day of street hiking around the city.The traditional lamb stew was nicely spiced from first bite to last. I'm not in a position to know how traditional it was, but it was delicious.A Guiness blonde was a thirst quencher when I first arrived, and a shot of Red Breast 12 provided a smooth finish to the meal and the evening.I know I'll be back the next time I'm in San Francisco.

Johnny Foleys was right next to my hotel (i.e., the Hilton), while recently attending the VRDC conference. After a short walk from the hotel, my colleagues and I were able to enjoy some very nice Irish beer and food. The restaurant's service was excellent, we didn't even wait long, but the food was the best. I had the shepherd's pie which was one of the best that I have had.

In San Francisco for my birthday. Not sure where to eat and walking around looking at menus. Ended up at Foley's pub. Treated myself to the prime rib and was very happy. Pink, tender, and juicy! Add a little horse radish and I was done. Wife had the chicken pot pie which was okay. Ryan did an excellent job taking care of us. Nancy the manager checked in to be sure we were well taken care of and made the birthday celebration complete with the happy birthday song.

First night in San Francisco after a long flight. Excellent cottage pie. Husband enjoyed the fish and chips. Guinness was good. The pino grigio was good but extortionate at $13 a glass. The dearest glass of wine in a week and by no means the best! Live music. May have enjoyed it more if not so tired and cheaper wine.

On a recent stay in San Fransisco we dined twice in this bar, the atmosphere was good, it was busy the first night the waitress was excellent, it was good but grub with a nice glass of Guinness. Usual fare was things like Irish stew at $25 it was good though, bangers and mash, fish and chips etc all good. The second night the wait was a bit pushy wanting another sitting but the food was just as good.

We've been coming to San Fran every second year for the last 8 years. We stumbled across this place on our very first night in San Fran, went in, ate, drank, loved it and now make it our first dinner stop every single visit. The place is always busy which is a great sign. The staff are friendly and professional. The Guinness is served perfect! The food has always been great, no matter what we've ordered. It is a bit pricey for food and drink, but you are in the middle of the City, it's clean and the food is really good so not a problem. We will always come here on our first night on future visits!

After reading reviews, we went for an early dinner with high expectations of returning to a real Irish pub...we were not given the option of eating in the main area which had lots of energy, or in the bar area, adjacent to a family with a small child...service was slow...Irish beers terrific...cod croquette appetizer was potato with a few shards of cod...beef & Guinness soup tasty, however the cottage pie had the same flavors and was overloaded with potatos without much of the expected meat...mussels tasty...overall ambience was poor and the food did not save the meal...too expensive for the quality of the meal

Food was pretty good and the atmosphere was definitely lively and loud with the live band playing, but also a lot of fun to watch. Irish beer on tap of course and the steak was excellent! But probably not a place to come have a deep conversation with a friend over a pint. As it's a very popular place.

If you enjoy a good Irish pub, then head on over to John Folly's. Great bar with bunch of Irish drafts. Decor definitely ye old Irish (lots of dark wood/old fashioned light fixtures). & the food's very good especially if you're craving an Irish specialty like bangers & mash or Sheppard's pie. We were there on a Saturday nite & appears later in the evening they even have an Irish band playing the traditional folk music.

So we wanted to go to this place while we were there in San Francisco. It's one of the places you HAVE to eat at while you're there.... apparently... We'll when we went, the restaurant was nice, but our wait to get our food took forever! And with how pricey the menu items were, we were expecting a lunch fit for a king.. We were disappointed to find that our sandwiches weren't even all that great. The corned beef was dry, the bread for the sandwiches was very dry and hard and made our gums bleed afterwards, and everything wasn't as wonderful as we thought it would be. My advice, you don't HAVE to go here to take in the full San Francisco experience.. Unfortunately, we didn't have the best time.

We loved the hostess. She remembered us when we came back the next night. So - yes - it was good enough to eat at twice. It was very close to our hotel. It looked busy but we were seated right away both times. The atmosphere is fun - it evokes Irish Pub feel - but the paintings are obvious cheap fakes. But hey - you're in San Fran, not Dublin. My son loved the fish and chips. I had the gorgonzola Waldorf salad the first night and the Cottage Pie the second. I finished both - so good. Excellent prices for San Francisco.

Close to our hotel and dear to my party Irish wife we are always game for an Irish Pub! Was so excited to find a Guinness Beef and Barley stew but was totally disappointed. Our waitress noticed immediately even though she was covering a huge rowdy table. He manager came over and suggested the lamb stew. I wasn't charged for either bowl. I could tell that she genuinely wanted all of her customers happy. It was very crowded but we were treated like we were the only ones there. I was skeptical about going because of the negative reviews. The drinks truly are overpriced. $2.00 more than I've ever paid for a rum and coke. Draft was almost $9.00 a pint. Ultimately that doesn't make much of a difference in the light of such outstanding customer service!! The lamb stew was out of this world good. We also suggest the soda bread and butter!!

Four of us went here for the DUELING piano bar, appetizers, and drinks. We went on a Thursday night. It started at 930 and we got a table when we arrived at 845. It got packed so go early. Food was amazing and drinks were good. It was a bit expensive tho. The entertainment was AWESOME! Definitely must do. It is free on Wednesday and Thursday. I think there is a cost on weekends but not for sure. This was a great find.

Hungry from a day of wine tours we looked at the reviews and chose Johnny Foleys. This place has a great vibe and has we known, we would have gone down to the Cellar where the duelling pianos were. I had the fish and chips and my husband had the potatoe and bacon soup (which he raved about) and the fried chicken. The portions are HUGE here! The chicken dinner had 3 large pieces of chicken with a side of mashed potatoes with a whiskey gravy (bit of an odd taste). We also had the calamari for an appy. Needless to say we left totally and utterly stuffed from all the food. It was filling and really good! Quite a nice selection of beer as well which we enjoy. Loved the ambience, food and service. Would come back again!

A great way to enjoy lunch and good food!

There are two facets to Foley's - the upstairs pub/restaurant and the downstairs piano bar.Taking the upstairs first - good selection of food on the menu, we went for the traditional Irish stew which was really good, very tasty and a good size portion. Coming in at $24 - not cheap. Went for the pint of Guinness - again not cheap, think around $9. However, service was good and lively atmosphere, some areas of the bar quite loud. Overall, a good meal, although quite expensive for what is a pub meal.Downstairs is the piano bar, we were advised to get down for before 09:00 for the show to start at 09:30. Because it was Thursday no charge, Friday, Saturday $10 entry.Basically, two people playing side by side pianos and the audience chooses the songs, albeit with a tip you decide! Really good evening, might have been lucky but plenty of audience participation and a really good sign-a-long!!! Drinks are slightly expensive (see above), but, would recommend if you want to do something a little different. Good location too, just off Union Square.

Been here a couple of times now. Although it is a bit on the expensive side even my San Francisco standards there is a really good atmosphere in the place and it is always busy.

When I lived in San Francisco, I would come here from time to time because my gym was close by, and I need my fix of Irish pub food from time to time as a born and raised Midwesterner. I really like the fish and chips here. And they have potato skins! The wings are pretty good. I would often order the lamb sliders, then regret it because you only get two and they're kind of expensive for what they are...The service has been consistently good, and I have no complaints about that. They are good at checking in frequently to see if you need another drink.The prices are pretty high because this is tourist central. Last time I came here, I ordered 2 Grey Goose martinis, a beer, the wings, lamb sliders, and fish and chips, and the bill was around $100. If you are visiting San Francisco, there are so many other amazing food options for the same price point. Irish pubs are everywhere. Get something uniquely good in San Francisco, like burritos (Cancun is pretty close by), Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, etc. If you want a burger, go to Popson's. But if you want fish and chips, it's a tie between this place and The Chieftain (the other Irish pub in a touristy part of SF). It is easier to get a seat and a little less loud and cramped here compared to The Chieftain.

Went here for dinner...really impressed with the Irish pub atmosphere and excellent food (the Yellow Thai curry was excellent)...highly recommend. We then went back another night for the dueling pianos...worst night of our trip to SF. The pianists were mediocre at best, but what was terrible was that they were essentially holding customers ransom for songs to be played. My brother requested a song and put in $20 (others were putting in $5 or $10 per song)...the pianists then said they wanted $50 and said they wouldn't play the song until they got that much. Absolutely disgusting! I would rate this place 4 or 5 for the pub, but 0 for the piano bar section.

I think the experience may have been worsened by the fact we went in for a late meal on a Friday evening. In truth, we were only eating here as we wanted to go downstairs for the piano bar opening, which in itself was merely alright - mainly due to a sketchy crowd of student types in.The food was decent, big portions and taste enough. The service was reasonable, not slow enough to be bad but hardly attentive. The venue was busy and a large crowd of loudmouths had spilled out irritatingly close to my table. I was pleased when a waitress shifted them as if someone had taken a step closer to my plate of corned beef then he was going to be wearing it before being taken to Suplex City. Wouldn't recommend against it, but wouldn't bother going back.

One of the greatest duelling piano shows we have seen. The pianists are exceptional singers, comedians and entertainers. The crowd was energized, and having a really great time. Bartenders were very knowledgeable and provided great service. I would highly recommend visiting the piano bar.

We were not able to try their food due to many pending orders as informed by one of the crew, so we settle to have a couple of beers. With a local live band playing 70's and 80's music, we forget that we're hungry :D The place is lively and clean, Beers are bit pricey though.

Great restaurant.......love it

We arrived for an early dinner. Our server, Casey, was awesome. We ordered corned beef & cabbage and lamb stew. I also ordered brown bread (which was $8....usually comes with meals in Irish restaurants) everything was great. Glad we went early as the noise level is super loud and the later it gets, the louder it gets. I had been to JF's before. Lots of ambience but although the music was good, I prefer traditional Irish music in an Irish pub. We'll be back. 

Great Irish Pub

We had dinner and beer at this lovely Irish Pub. The fish and chips was more than I could eat (and delicious) and they have a really nice selection of beer. No big surprises

Best Irish in San Francisco

Actually disgusted with the way we were treated whilst in this bar. Having spent a lot of money the previous night. The tall bar tender was so off hand with both myself and my partner on a few separate occasions. The management should pursue him with a disciplinary for his appalling attitude and behavior. Slamming drinks and your bill down on the bar is no way to treat a customer. I have never in my life been so degraded and belittled by a bar tender before. I think this chap needs a career change !! We will not be returning!!

Yum!!!

We called for dinner after reading trip advisor . Pub was very very busy why I don't know the beer was $8 a pint and the food was also very expensive . 

Great food but bad service on second visit

We loved this bar & had our first meal in San Francisco there as it was really near our hotel. We called twice more for drinks in our way out & decided to eat there again last night. Although the food was still fantastic our waiter was not! We had to wait ages for him to take our order, he did not bring us any bread & butter which is always served & he did not speak to us at all or tell us his name! We dare not ask him for anything further once he had served our meal. The other staff there are really friendly & make your visit a really good one. Just try to avoid the tables with the male waiter!!!

Thanks from Tassie couple

The amazing food is just yo start foe the awesome-ness of this place! As an Aussie travelling couple, this place was so incredibly kind and friendly towards us. Gave us fantastic customer service and friendly banter that we appreciated above words. Everyone was amazing in this place from the moment one arrives. Thanks everyone! We are very grateful for all kindness and fun you all possessed from beginning to end! 

Classy joint

If you want a nice respite from the streets and the ever-present cloud of dope smoke on the streets of San Francisco, this is a nice, classy place to stop in for an afternoon refreshment. The decor is deep stained wood paneled. Bartenders are old school and professional. Very very nice place.

Worth a try

We dropped in for lunch to escape the rain. I had a great corned beef and cabbage lunch and my husband had a sandwich that could have been shared by both of us. Irish music plays in the background and the decor is sports/Irish pub. Restuarant is located right in the main shopping area. Service was fine.

Not the place to pop in for just a drink

Called in here for a break from shopping. It was around 5pm when a lot of places in the city have happy hour-not here. Ambience was nice and it feels like a proper pub, but a pint of local beer and half a Guinness came to $15-ouch!I'm sure the food is good, though we didn't stay. If you just want a drink, you'll find cheaper options available.

Heard it was fun.

Brought to this fine place by son in law. Must say he has great taste. Excellent selection of Irish brew and whiskey. The food was amazing. Saw some deserts that if I hadn't been so full I would have torn them up. Stop by its worth it.

Finally a true pub

A real pub, great drinks, great food, unbeatable decoration. Guinness served perfectly, friendly service, great decoration and wonderful location. What more can you ask for? Lower prices for the Guinness, yes maybe, but this place is outstanding. 

Luck of the Irish

Decided to give this place a try as I walked back to my hotel. Decided to order the corn beef and cabbage. Best Corn Beef and Cabbage I have ever had. Service was also excellent.

Irish Pub?

We popped in for a Guinness and something to eat. The Guinness was $10 a pint and the food was $30 ish for pub meal. So we had a pint of Guinness and went to the diner around the corner which was half the cost for food. Good atmosphere and efficient service but more like a sports bar than an Irish Pub. 

Fine old Irish time!

My Irish cousins were out to visit so we met up and what a great time. Live music, easy to reach by any means: bus, rail, taxi, UBER, on foot. Lively music, great looking interior, quiet back room where you can talk and hear each other; then when that closes, move out to the blaring and deafening live music for some dancing and Irish fun. Good, full menu. Gluten free safe; no problems for the allergic. Extensive choices for our group. Wonderful wonderful service. We hated to leave. 

Nice pub but nothing special

This was the first pub we came across when we arrived in San Francisco. The staff were friendly but I found the lighting to be dull and needed my phone light to read the menu. My cottage pie was hot and tasty. My friends burger was adequate as was my other friends bangers and mash. The photos and paintings on the walls were interesting to view. A nice pub but nothing special.

Good lunch

A group of us met at Foley's for lunch on a Monday and I was pleased with the food, service, and atmosphere. Our waitress gave me a great recommendation for lunch.

Nice pub!

We had lunch here. Good burgers and veggie panini. Friendly service. They probably do a swift business with the hotels and it looks like they can house a crowd. 

Good food, Good atmosphere.

I came here on a Saturday evening and had the fish & chips. The fish was tasty, the batter was light and crispy, not soggy. The chips were fine, nothing amazing but fine. Atmosphere is good and staff are friendly.
