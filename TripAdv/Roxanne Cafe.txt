Ate here twice in three days. Evening meal on first day in SF, quick service, good food and prices appear the same as other venues. Two days later we re-visited for breakfast which was fantastic. Food was fresh, tasty and great value for money. Coffee refills offered every few minutes. Plenty of locals visiting for food too which is always a good sign.Seen other reviews about service, but we can only judge on what we experienced and it was great service and food on both occasions. Would revisit if in the area.

Fantastic!

It's not very often that I can go to a restaurant more than once and be delighted with the food. We have been there twice so far in the week we are staying in San Francisco and will go again before we leave. Their food is fresh and expertly cooked and there are numerous meals I could choose from on the menu. Highly recommended.

We ate here twice while at our stay in San Francisco, mid afternoon bites and breakfast. It was right beside our hotel so was easy access. Very quiet around 3 so if you've just arrived in town and are starving the Caprese salad and soup were the things to hit the spot. Service was great and there were only 2 other couples when we arrived. Now for breakfast, be prepared. The line ups when you arrive (this was a good indication), the service, the buzz of the tourists and of course the food was worth the wait. Huge beautifully presented portions, attentive staff who were there for coffee refills every 10 minutes if needed and something for everyone on the menu. Thank You.

Not worth the wait.

A nice little cafe for breakfast just off Union Square, should have been good, but it wasn't. The service was terrible. We waited an age to have our order taken even though the cafe was only half full, then they forgot about our order (we found this out when we asked them where our food was 20mins after we placed our order) getting a fill up of coffee also needed patience. The staff were stony faced rather than the usual SF breakfast friendliness. The food was good (so 2 stars) but spoiled by service. Won't be back.

Had breakfast here only because it was next door to our hotel. The food was fine, the service lackluster. Had to ask twice for water. The waitress acted like she'd rather be somewhere else.

Firstly the food was fine, it won't set the world alight but it was a breakfast that set you up for the day.The service on the other hand was dismal. We weren't even acknowledged for 5 minutes despite being passed by staff multiple times. Our waitress was changed 3 times and the one we ended up with was definitely not happy to be there.An example was my other half's free refill coffee which was never refilled. The table behind got refills but the coffee never got as far as our table.Was only a Friday morning so would be interested to see how they can cope on a weekend. Won't be returning or recommending.

Decent meal. I had the beef merlot which came with creamy mash and vegetables which was very nice, but could have been hotter. My husband had a Roxanne burger with fries. He said it was tastier than it looked. Service was ok. To be honest we felt rushed out. As soon as we declined a dessert there was no time to linger, which was a shame. We went elsewhere for a drink then. Reasonable price. Tip included in the bill-saved time deliberating I suppose.

In fact, the vegetarian burger and salmon were divine and would highly recommend. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly, even if the restaurant itself was a bit under-staffed. Food came quickly, and was priced fair in san fran standards! Only thing is to watch out on cost of drinks, as a glass of wine is 10$ and adds up quick!

We called in here for a quiet family meal and had a good time and good food.The prices were reasonable although the glass of wine was a small one.However, as another reviewer mentioned, they added the gratuity to the bill (they said it was standard for a table of 4) and when i asked for it to be removed, i was told it was the automatic till, but i held firm and they did remove it.I don't mind leaving a tip, and often do give the expected 15%, but i like to choose to add it.They need to rethink their policy as I'm sure other people will agree...and make the same call.

My husband and I stopped in here for dinner with my daughter and her two children, mostly because it was quiet. The server was pleasant and the food was not very good, just passable. After we ate we left quickly because the baby was starting to be fussy, so I just scanned the check and paid it. It wasn't until I got home that I really looked at the check and that is when I realized that the restaurant had added an 18% gratuity!! Before we left I hadn't noticed that, and so I added another 18%---they got a 36% gratuity!!! Never again. There was no warning on the menu that the gratuity was included. I know I should have read the check more carefully, but I feel that they were really ripping off their customers, many of whom are tourists and will never be back.

This is one of those restaurants which you would hope to find along a side street while enjoying an evening out in central London. We walked past Roxannes while the evening meal menu board was being prepared on the pavement outside. We asked if it was necessary to book a table and the girl said if we came in before 7.30 we would be O.K. Arriving at 7.15 we were shown to a table ( I estimate that there is seating for about 60 covers which makes it quite cosy) and ordered our starters - Pollenta chips. Our drinks were a Bellini and a glass of Pinot. Main courses - Beef Merlot and Seared Halibut. We shared a New York Cheesecake. The food was excellent value for the money ( 102 US Dollars including taxes and tip ) and surpassed the quality of some of the higher end restaurants which we have eaten at while in America this holiday. We can highly recommend the restaurant. Advice. If this is your first visit to San Francisco be aware that anything that you see priced in a shop/ restaurant etc DOES NOT include an Employee Benefit Tax nor the State Tax.

We were leaving SF to head to Yosemite but needed a big breakfast first. We were actually headed to a different restaurant but got confused going there. We decided to park and then we were puzzled reading the parking restrictions and asked a local man walking down the street for help. He is the one who said, "why are you going there? Just go to the place on the corner. I eat there all the time." And so we did. We lucked in to a table just as the restaurant was filling up. We all three enjoyed our breakfasts (omelettes and good toast). Definitely a good solid breakfast and not at all expensive!

I stopped in here just randomly one morning looking for a nice brunch meal. I got the lox and bagel, but substituted toast instead of the bagel, which they were able to accommodate. I was VERY pleased about the amount and quality of the lox spread. The lox itself was plump, light, and velvety...I think its the best lox I've ever had. It was absolutely perfect and very filling. This meal was so good, I ended it up ordering it again the following morning. The cafe itself is very quaint. It has exposed brick walls, and makes good use of its smaller space. They were able to accommodate me quickly on a Sunday morning. Staff was mostly nice, although they weren't exactly friendly. A smile more often would go a long way. When I put in my order for my to-go lox the next day, they packaged it very nicely and included the extra capers I had requested. I would definitely come back for the lox again if I ever find myself in San Francisco. This was one of the best meals that I had during my visit.

What great smells when you enter, the chef does Italian and American cooking right. Nice small (about 50 seats) cafe 2 or 3 blocks up Powell Street from Union Square, with a cable car stop on the same corner. Can get pretty busy during summer touristy times, but they do take reservations so go for it. Great food, great service, nice small wine list, quick service, reasonable prices. Quite a hike up to Nob Hill, a much steeper part of Powell St. but it is only 2 blocks of agony, you can do it or take the cable car or a cab.

My husband and I tried this little cafe for breakfast one morning, as it was just down the way from where we were staying. The staff were friendly, service was fine, food wasn't anything to write home about, and the dining area was very cramped. This is probably typical of a SF eatery, but it was a little too close for comfort for me... I'm sure it's fine for others, but I'm not the sort of person who likes to share a table with strangers.The food was ok, I might eat there again, but due to the size of the dining area, and lack of any sort of waiting area, I would look elsewhere first.

Great Breakfast

This place was recommended for breakfast and I will surely do the same. Good Food, Friendly Staff, and a relaxing atmosphere. It is on the steeper side of Powell St but worth the walk. Check it out.

Walked 2 blocks from where we were staying and enjoyed tasty food; friendly and professional service; throwback classic soft jazz in intimate atmosphere with view onto Powell. I'd return without question. I can see why it crowds up as the morning ages, but it was spot on for us.

Tiny venue but seated immediately at 0900 on a Wednesday AM, we were very impressed by the accommodating servers & QUICK food delivery! California omelet was good but bland. Good place for quick nosh!

Roxanne cafe has good/great food for kinda high prices. It is nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done if you need a basic breakfast place.

Cute and Tasty

Very convenient location two blocks up from Union Square right on the cablecar line. Came for two breakfasts and two dinners. Morning was definitely busier. Excellent eggs benedict with salmon and cafe au lait. Dinner was lobster ravioli one night and mushroom ravioli the next. Both very nicely seasoned and only lacked a bread basket to soak up the sauce. Generous portion of homemade tiramisu both nights enjoyed with the house chianti. Can't wait to return!

lovely place, but hit and miss with the waitresses

We ate here loads of times during our stay in SF. Lovely food, with a big range of omelettes and sandwiches. Never tried dinner, though.Most of the waitresses are really friendly, but one was plain rude and shoved a tip-chart in my boyfriend's hand when he was paying, whilst hissing "service charge not included! service charge not included!". We always tip when we are happy, so I don't understand where this behaviour came from. Very rude. We considered not going back, but when we saw the evil one wasn't working, we slipped in and had a lovely last breakfast before we left SF (and left a tip for the friendly and smiley waitress of course!).One time for lunch, they were overrun and forgot our order. Took more than an hour for our food to arrive. Annoying and it made me late for my conference, but I suppose this can happen.Among the best places around Union Square in my opinion.

Enjoyed Breakfast

We enjoyed a nice breakfast at Roxanne Cafe. The menu offered some very creative omelets and all the food was very good. The atmosphere was cozy, the prices were moderate and the service was good. 

Go for breakfast...you won't regret it!

Picture this: My last day in San Francisco after a brutal work week, it is pouring down rain, and I just need a good thing to happen in the last hours of my trip. I need to go home -- I'm tired and my flight is delayed and I need a good breakfast and coffee. So I head out of my hotel on Nob Hill, and descend the steep roadway to Roxanne Cafe. As I get to the corner where Roxanne Cafe is located, I see the warm lights and it beckons me in. So begins my last meal -- and best in this recent trip to San Francisco. Roxanne Cafe is perfect -- intimate with good seating, good coffee and excellent, pleasant service. I had a seat by the windows so I could watch the rain and the people bustling down the street. I had for breakfast the "Corned Beef Sunrise" - Corned beef hash with country potatoes, 2 poached eggs covered in hollandaise sauce and toast. I like to think I'm an expert in poached eggs. I make them a lot at home. The ones at Roxanne Cafe were PERFECT. Not close. PERFECT. The hash was more a slice of corn beef seasoned and caramelized on the grill. SO GOOD. The coffee was hot and good, and while not strong, it was delicious and I had several cups while watching the rain. I just thought this place was a perfect balance of ambiance, delicious food, hot coffee and good staff. Totally solid. I'd definitely come again when I'm in San Francisco.

Lovely place for a break

As Roxannes is only metres from our hotel we called in for coffee on the first morning we were in San Francisco. Apart from good cappuccino the place has a really nice feel so we returned for lunch and a couple of breakfasts. All meals were beautiful, served quickly and with lovely staff. Plus if you can get a window seat its great people watching

Nice mid-priced restaurant only a few blocks from Union Square

This small restaurant has a nice interior feel with a variety of choices on the menu. I ordered the halibut special, which was very good and my wife ordered the salmon, which she enjoyed. Prices are very reasonable, given the quantify of the food served. This restaurant isn't a must visit restaurant, but certainly is a safe choice for a good meal at a reasonable price near Union Square

small cafe in lower Nob Hill, great food, reasonable prices and very helpful staff (my food intolerances were accommodated even after they prepared the meal, which unbeknownst to me contained dairy)
