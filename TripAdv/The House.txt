We were told about The House by numerous people but had a difficult time getting in as it is so popular, but finally made got a table. What an amazing find, unbelievable food!! The food was some of the best I've had in SF and a small, quaint place but very fun. Did I say the food was AMAZING?? Served somewhat family style so you can share, definitely the way to go as you hate to limit your taste buds to only one entree. The sauces make every dish the best.Put this on your bucket list.

We asked a few local foodies where to go for good Asian fusion food, and they suggested The House. Glad we asked. Food was delicious, service was excellent, price was fair. The highlight was the clams in a spicy broth that was hard to stop eating. The sea bass was also excellent. Will definitely recommend it to friends who are visiting the area.

We were brought here by a local who had eaten here once before. We were in the mood for Asian fusion type of food that night and this seemed to fit. Expertly prepared food, fresh, flavorful, nice wine and sake. Gets crowded and glad we had a reservation, even on a Sunday night. The line was out the door when we left and with good reason. Seriously tasty food here.

We recently visited San Francisco and were on a hunt for good Asian food. We came across this gem. The food is off the charts. Each plate was beautiful and tasty and the plates were works of art. I had the soft shell crab and Wasabi noodles. My wife had the halibut, both were excellent. San Francisco is known for it's great food and this is a location that lives up to those standards!

We just spent a week in San Francisco and Sonoma and this was the best meal by far. The restaurant is small and the tables tightly packed. The dishes came out fast so there was no lingering between courses. But the food was amazing. We had the calamari and the scallops appetizer specials which were each incredible. We went on to the miso cod special and the grilled sea bass which were even better. Several of the dishes had a wonderful smoky grilled flavor. Not sure how they accomplish that there but however they do, it's great. We tried to slow down and savor every bite but everything was so delicious it was hard to stop eating. Our server was delightful and made great recommendations. We are sorry we can't return next week to sample the rest of the menu.

This American Asian restaurant is a great place to impress your loved ones or your boss. the place is small and you have to have a reservation. If you go at 5.30pm, they might be able to fit you in. the kitchen is small, but the amount of food and the presentation and quality are out of this world.My favorite dish is the Chilean Sea Bass. The texture is so exquisite, when you chew it, it melts in your mouth like butter.Other dishes are all good too. If you want to impress your loved one, valentine's day is a must. The presentation of the dishes are ....WOW... that is all I can say... amazing and damn good.They also have a good selection of wine from all over.

The food is definitely 5 star. The tuna poke was the best I've ever had and we also enjoyed the octopus appetizer. We shared the flank steak with Chinese noodles. The steak was a little chewy, but the Chinese flavors and the noodles were perfect. This is a small restaurant and crowded with tables close together and very noisy. Reasonably priced and generous portions!

Wonderful Asian flavors and presentation on spectacular seafood dishes. This is a very small and unassuming restaurant with its door just off the main Columbus drag. It presents with little fanfare and no real front end to the restaurant, and with tight and fairly basic seating. But an early seating without a reservation and cool air and incredible smells wafting through the dining area had us hooked immediately. A plethora of specials for the evening allowed us to sample salads, scallops, sea bass, halibut and dessert. All the selections were right off the boat; prepared in wonderful sauces and with accompaniments that gave a colorful, surprising, and romantically tinged artistic presentation to the food. Seafoods were not overcooked, kept their firmness, and were matched with sweet, tangy, and velvety sauces. Wines by the bottle and the glass are eclectic but rich and well thought out. My Vermentino white was snappy and fruity with a wonderful acidic afterburn, but full-flavored and complementing the sea bass perfectly. The Cotes Du Rhone was a bit more full-bodied but fit the bill on some other flavors that surrounded the lightly seared sea scallops. I know there are 50-70 dollar bottles on this menu scattered like dropped kindling, but with the selection of house wines, you can save those $$ for......desserts. No one should leave here disappointed. The only caveat: make sure you have a reservation if you are getting here after 6, even on a week night. And parking takes a few minutes!

I am a big fan of Asian Fusion cuisine so I thought I would like this restaurant. That was an understatement, I loved it. The fish was so fresh. The tuna tartare was delicious & I had the best halibut dish I have ever tasted.We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday night and the place was packed. The only negative thing I can say about the restaurant is that there are too many tables in that small space. It was extremely tight. But if you don`t mind that ,go for it.

I booked at The House based on the menu they had on their website. Once there, none of the suggested dishes was available. " Our web site is outdated " was the answer. Entering the room, you are caught by a strong smell of kitchen - wondering if their extractors work in the kitchen ? The waitress was either fed up with her job or had a bad day. In any case having a smile on her face was not included. And she was probably trying to beat her own record of fast talking for the daily suggestions !Positive note: the food is very tasty and dishes are nicely presented. But this was not sufficient to balance off the negative feeling.

We decided to try this place because our client raved about it. My boss liked this place more than I did. For me, a great food experience includes not only great food but excellent service. I don't think our waitress ever cracked a smile. She looked sad the whole time, and could have been a little more attentive. She never checked in with us to make sure everything was ok. For the price of the food I expect better service.We ordered the poke for an appetizer. It tasted slightly fishy and needed a little more seasoning. I ordered the chicken which was cooked almost perfectly but needed a touch more salt. I would say the same was true about the fish my boss ordered, it could have used more salt too. I would not run back to this restaurant the next time I'm in town.

This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend. Good thing too, because, just walking by, you probably wouldn't think of looking at it twice. The entrance is small but the restaurant goes into the building quite a bit. They have made the most with the room they have though. Make sure you have a reservation. We had a dinner reservation at 5.30 pm, but thought of dropping in early to see if there were spots. Lucky for us there were some spots, and this was 10 minutes after them opening for dinner!We were given the list of specials verbally, but I couldn't keep up with all of it. Didn't think there was anything spectacular in the specials so went to the menu -- and I'm glad we did. Had salmon rolls and dumplings at first. They were good but nothing spectacular. I'm sure they had better appetizers we just didn't know what would work for us. Then for the main course, we went for an ordinary sounding Mushroom Rice served with grilled prawns, shaved bonito. When the dish came to the table it was no ordinary dish. Something on the rice was fluttering. We were mesmerized and flabbergasted at the same time. We were looking at the dish for about 10-15 seconds, and the couple next to us informed that there was nothing alive in there. The fish flakes are fried and they are so light. Due to the rising hot air from the food, the flakes will flutter back and forth. Seeing is believing. Then we dug into the main course. It was one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had. The taste itself is indescribable and had a mix of many of the best tastes possible.For dessert, we had the special of the day: Panna cotta topped with strawberry and mango. It was also exquisitely presented and tasted amazing. That was just the cherry on top. And we left with great satisfaction. Definitely a place to visit at least once if in San Francisco. Don't forget to make a reservation though.

Tucked away on upper Grant, above Broadway, it is a cozy, unique  bistro for seating for (I'm guessing) about 25 people. The dishes are reasonable priced, but the portions are large. The chef could give lessons to other San Francisco restaurants on the art of presentation. For lunch I had the salmon salad which was delicious and perfectly cooked. A real find.

Took my wife, son and his fiance. Been thinking of trying this place since we passed it on a trip to SFO last year. This is an incredibly noisy and cramped space with dimmed lighting that makes it hard to read the menu. We were all in a festive mood, but our server was harried, unsmiling and not in a good mood, which colored our visit. I had delicious White Shrimp and Chinese Chive Dumplings to start, a hit all around. Less satisfying were the fried salmon roll (unfinished) and the mussels, which were unappealingly gigantic and sent back with no compensation (a first in my 70 years!). Entrees (halibut, sea bass, ahi tuna, and pork chop) fared better on the whole, though the cut of pork was way too fatty and undercooked vis-a-vis my very specific request. Two acceptable deserts and two beers brought our total check to just under $200, which we judged too much for the perfunctory experience.

This restaurant has become our "Must Go To Whenever in San Francisco" place. The Asian Fusion cuisine was, as always, exquisite, with a very wide selection of regular and special appetizers and main courses. This restaurant serves the best pork chop I ever had anywhere, and the fish dishes are all excellent, beautifully spiced and prepared. All of the appetizers I've had (about 10) have been uniformly excellent, and many times I've made a complete meal of 3 appetizers. This time, the pork ribs were superb. The wine list was short but good. The place is small, which I like, and noisy but friendly, with very attentive and good service.

So far we have not eaten anything here that we haven't fully enjoyed. Not surprisingly it is a busy little place, popular with locals and stray tourists.

I almost never give a 5 appreciation, but The House comes close in its category.

I rarely give five star reviews. I grew up in North Beach (not too far from this place) and I am a traveler. I am a foodie and possibly a food snob (is that redundant?). Anyway, I have eaten a lot of fine food in great restaurants all over the place. I almost went with 4 stars, but then I thought, why? This place deserves 5 stars. I could not think of one thing that could have been better. All of our food was phenomenal, and the service was spot on. We made a reservation, which I recommend, for any day, let alone a Friday night. We did have to wait 15 minutes, but the restaurant is small, so I don't knock them for that. It was well worth it. I had the miso sea bass. It was amazing and the portion was the perfect size. I almost could not finish it.

"The House" is quite an impressive operation. This modest 40-50 seat restaurant must turn over multiple times a day - and consistently "churnes out" the most amazing Asian inspired food both with regards to tase and visual apperance! A husband and wife operation, the wife calmly manages the front and the husband heads up the hectic and creative kitchen, have over many years tuned this restaurant to run to perfection, Daily specials based on available and fresh produce complement an extensive and interesting menu. Uppon our last visit we had the best shashimi ever for apetizer and a perfect albacore for main. Recommended!

This restaurant is Amazing! I had never been to an Asian Fusion restaurant, and I think I went to one of the best ones in the world. I expect this place to have Michelin Stars soon, because the dishes are original and really incredible. The scallops, the octopus, the angus steak, etc are all perfectly cooked, and originally seasoned. Even though this place is a bit more expensive than average, you do not leave hungry.Seeing that the amount of tables are very limited my advice would be to book your table if you don't want tot wait.

Started with their most popular appetizer, fried salmon roll. Very good, a most order. I then had the grilled Unagi (Eel) on top of a avocado risott, wow.... Then I finished it off with the sea bass on top of garlic noodles, again absolutely amazing. Overall, a true gem find for me and now a must visit when I come to this great city...

Ribeye is extremely good. Very noisy. Reserved a table, got there on time and was seated immediately.

Had to stop here to dine because we've been here before. It's just as good as it was back then. Just great tasting dish specials of seafood and I love it. A small but cozy place.

Super efficient service and great fresh seafood

This is a great little restaurant - thoroughly enjoyed our food here. We had deep fried salmon rolls, sashimi and tuna, all of which were spot on. Also quick, efficient and friendly service. I would definitely come here again.

Went to The House for an early dinner before seeing Beach Blanket Babylon this past Friday evening. Everything from start to finish was delicious, spot on preparation and presentation.The food and flavors here are distinctive and savory. We wound up sharing everything. We started with Deep-Fried Salmon Roll served with Chinese hot mustard and seared scallops with a ponzu citrus based sauce. Could not have two different appetizers but each was a standout. For mains we went with Grilled Sea Bass served with garlic ginger soy and Kurobuta Pork Chop served with pomegranate currant sauce. As with the starters both were excellent, my wife said the pork chop was one of the best ever. The garlic noodles with the sea bass were outstanding.Often with great apps and entrees, dessert is a letdown. Not here, we shared a special chocolate macadamia torte with chantilly cream and a scoop of espresso ice cream. Delicious ending to a great dinner. There is a nice little wine list and glasses are reasonable. We were able to snag the front table next to the window which gave us some extra room. Service was friendly and efficient. The House is an excellent choice for Asian Fusion in North Beach.

wow! what a great meal

Taken here by foodie friends while visiting San Francisco. what a gem. The shrimp dumplings were scrumptious and the wasabi noodles with pork sophisticated and bold and delicious. the others in our party all were as impressed and happy as I.

A fun little restaurant with great art and good food

A lot of reviews comment on how small it is, but most restaurants we visit are small and we like that since they bring their own character to the dining experience. We did not feel crowded and were able to easily talk to each other at a table for 4. Loved the artsy decor, service was good and the dishes were different and very flavorful. We all enjoyed the evening.

The House is on the fringe of SF Chinatown on Grant Ave. It is small and packed. It opens at 5.30pm for dinner and in a swish, it is jammed! We played it safe, made a reservation and arrived early!! The menu is short, sweet and eclactic of asian, japanese and american fusion. The innovatively delightful appetizers, Poke, Salmon roll, Octopus.....set the taste buds and the tongues wagging. The main courses, Kobe short ribs, Sea bass, Mahi Mahi.... are so delectably satisfying and freshly scrumptous. We were all wonderfully stuffed, slowly and reluctantly filed out of this Gourmandise into the cold.

WOW!

Hands down, top 3 restaurants Ive tried in my life! Ambience was ok, service was really good, and the food was just perfect! Grilled SeaBass, Kurobuta PorkChop, and Mango Tapioca!...we even cancelled the reservation we had at another restaurant for the next day, and returned to "The House"! MUST!

Small quaint restaurant located close to North Beach, little Italy area. Look for the strip clubs and you will find this place. Parking was extremely difficult, bring your hiking shoes because you've onto be parking close. Food was excellent. Started with the shrimp dumplings, moved on to the black cod and Angus flatiron steak with Wasabi noodles. All deliciously prepared. Dessert included the chocolate bread pudding and mango tapioca. Although dessert not as good as our entrees it will definitely require repeat visits. Restaurant is not for the claustrophobic at heart. Tight seating and a little noisey. Food makes you forget about that fairly quickly. Wait staff also right on it and very knowledgeable. 

Excellent Food

Got the Chinese Chicken Salad and the Bbq pork sandwich. Both were very well prepared and tasted excellent.. Definitely worth trying.

You should always make reservation if you don't want to wait. This is a small restaurant with less than 10 tables located right in the heart of Little Italy. It can be noisy but the atmosphere is cosy and relaxing. The service was good and the food was delicious. Additionally, the prices are good for San Francisco.

Delicious food, too small and cramped space

I generally enjoy the social aspect of eating in a restaurant with a good atmosphere, good food and good service.Who doesn't?But, when a good restaurant like 'The house' has so little space that the guests waiting to be seated are literally standing next to your table and there is no chance to have a conversation without other tables interference then you know something is not right!Yet, 'The house' offers such a diverse, and smoothly designed experience of asian food cuisine that for most people it is worth the squeezed space!I highly recommend. 

Always a Treat

This is a consistently great restaurant. Although they turn tables over fairly quickly, you never feel rushed and service is attentive. The menu changes frequently, so specials are always worth considering. I have the beef short rib special and it was outstanding. Appetizers and desserts are also worth consideration. Wines by the glass are very good from a diversity of regions. Overall, this is always a great dining experience!

I highly recommend the house. It's a small space - about 16-18 tables. They do take reservations but you can also walk-in. We went on a Sunday night at 6:00 p.m. Waited until 6:30 for our table. The staff is highly knowledgeable and helpful. And the food is just delicious! The melding of flavors is just perfect. we had the fried salmon roll and grilled octopus to start. For our entrees we had the steak with noodles and a fish dish. Whatever you order will be delicious. 

Fabulous.

Small plates and entrees that are just amazing. Our appetizers included tuna tartar, spicy octopus, warm kale salad, and tempura battered green beans. All shared family style. We split an awesome rib-eye steak, fresh sea bass on garlic udon noodles and a special ling cod. Add to that a chocolate cake and mango tapioca for dessert and you've got a great dinner.Restaurant is small and seating is limited. Service is good. Food is outstanding. Had to wait a bit beyond our reservation time, but the great food made me forget about that. It's that yummy.

Fantastic food

Me and a colleague found this restaurant on trip advisor and visited saturday night. It is not a fancy restaurant, and were packed with young people. We ordered four starters to share and they were all unforgettable. For mains I had lightly grilled tuna and I was not disappointed.

Delicious but could use nicer staff

Food is a 5, service a 3...possibly because they know it's such a hot spot so they don't care, or maybe our waitress was having a bad day. At any rate, gave it a 5 because I would return for the food alone but better service would be nice.
