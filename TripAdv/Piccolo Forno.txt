Truly excellent pizza. The best I've had outside of Italy, although there are not many possibilities where we live. I'm sure that there are likely other pizzerias with equally good food, but we always stay in North Beach and it is close by. We wanted to try it last year and couldn't, so it was a must try this year. My wife's calzone was equally delicious. The owners are Italian, so it gave me a chance to speak a little Italian as we ordered and enjoyed our dinner al fresco. It is small, yet charming. It feels like many pizzerias where we've eaten during our times in Italy. We will return, definitely.

A comfortable place

Went here today with my partner. We got the Spaghetti Meatballs, Quattro Formaggi Pizza and the Caprese salad. Everything was DELICIOUS, service was great and we enjoyed relaxing in the casual atmosphere. Our waiter was super lovely and greeted us in Italian which added a lovely personal touch. Prices were very reasonable and the portion sizes were generous. Highly recommend!

This restaurant was lovely. I popped in there for lunch while on my walk through North Beach and the pizza was delicious. The service was very good and the prices reasonable. If I am able to return to SF then I will go back to Piccolo Forno

This is a one of a kind restaurant, maybe family owned. We were brought water and menus right away. The manager (?) was very friendly and explained the menu. We had a salad to start and then a pizza and dessert. We wished they offered wine but they said they don't have a liquor license. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a little on the high side, esp. the salad and desserts. The service was great!

On vacation here, just picked this on line from the good reviews it got. So happy we ate here. We both had 2 different ravioli specials. One butternut sage, the other fish with pink sauce ravi. So fresh, perfectly seasoned. Small place, great personal service. The owner is hands on. And did I mention the great prices? May have to end up going again on this trip...

While walking up the hill looking to eat Italian food, we spotted this pizza place with nice ambient.I truly enjoyed vegiterian pizza here with chad, squash, roasted eggplant, onion, and broccoli!! That 12" personal pizza was not only delicious, but it was right for my apatite. Among several Italian places in the neighborhood, I certainly recommend Piccolo Forno!

Dropped in here for a pizza slice for lunch on our way to Fisherman's Wharf and were so impressed with the food, service and prices ($4 for a large slice) that we decided to come back for dinner after our Alcatraz evening tour. It's BYO so we picked up a bottle down the road and we weren't charged corkage. The staff were happy to help with recommendations and we had homemade veal rigatoni and a white pizza with ham, rocket and truffle oil - both were spot on. Best value dinner we've had in the city!

Authentic Italian. A great little place where the owners are you chef's and the nicest guys you could meet. Maybe 10 tables with a few outside. This place is great authentic food for an incredibly reasonable prices for SF. They start you out with bread and oil and keep it coming throughout. The menus is mainly past and pizza with prices in the low teens. They also have some very nice salads. The food is incredibly fresh.They also have fabulous deserts. The Tartufo al Cioccolato ($6.50)Zabaione cream center, surrounded by chocolate and caramelized hazelnuts, topped with cocoa powder is out of the world. They don't serve liqueur but you can bring your ownIn 5 days we eat dinner here 2 times because with loved it so much. The pizza is thin crust any my 15 year old nephew, who is very very picky, said it was the best pizza he very ate. We tried 7 different entrees and loved every one. BTW make sure you up put extract grated cheese on your meal if you are so inclined.We only ate there twice and were obviously tourist (hence no guarantee that we will be back) but even so the owner provide a free Tartufo al Cioccolato dessert to my nephew recalling you much he enjoyed it 3 nights earlier. Next time I'm back in SF I'm definitely going back.

This is a small restaurant with maybe 8 - 10 tables. BYOB so we went next door to grab a bottle if wine. We were greeted warmly and told it would be about 30 minutes to seat our group of 4. It took 10 minutes, and our table was prepped. We were treated like family by the 3 older gentlemen servers from the time we walked in. They answered questions, brought samples and were especially helpful. We enjoyed a wonderful, relaxing dinner with our 2 teenage daughters. Our favorite was the Calzone Classico and the Caprese Salad. The desserts were especially good as well. We never felt rushed, even though they were steadily busy. Enjoyed every minute!

While walking away from the tourist saturated fisherman's wharf and pier area we were on Columbus and decided to try Piccolo Forno. Glad we did. We were greeted and treated like family even though we had never set foot in the place before. Food was excellent and reasonable enough. We arrived at about 5 minutes before noon and by 12:15 the place was packed so I suggest you arrive just before noon or after 1. I have posted some photo's including the menu in case that you wish to peruse it first. The wait staff consisting of 2-3 authentically Italian men in black t-shirts is extremely attentive and will make you LOVE them. We had a wonderful time as well as a wonderful meal. I have NOT given 5 dots in quite awhile but I feel that they deserve this.

Had a nice lunch at this restaurant in North Beach. The owner (I believe he was the owner) and waiter were Italian. The service was welcoming and polite, which we appreciated it. The food was just great. I had the pizza with the bresaola, which was really good. My wife had the Ravioli di Granchio, also really good. We had the Burrata to start. I wish we had tried the gnocchi instead of the appetizer, as the appetizer was good (as a function of good ingredients) but I expect the gnocchi are something more typical/special from the place. The restaurant did not serve alcohol at lunch (not sure if this is different at dinner), which was fine with me. Overall great experience. Strongly recommend. I am first generation Italian and this is a good authentic Italian restaurant.

A North Beach Charmer with Superb Penne Arrabiata!
Rating: 5
Date: May 7, 2017
I've been passing by this little gem of a restaurant on my scooter for several months now. I'm very familiar with North Beach and I noticed when Piccolo Forno opened about 6 months ago. My wife and I finally had lunch there today and I'm so glad we did! This place is right across the street from Italian Homemade which I have reviewed here at TripAdvisor. While I still love Italian Homemade, Piccolo Forno has four advantages: First they do offer pizza in various forms. Second, I think their sauces have more variety and are more flavorful than Italian Homemade (especially the Arrabiata!). Third, the place is more charming, welcoming and serves the food on real plates.. Fourth, they seem to have a broader menu -- more pasta choices, grilled vegetables, etc. It's an all Italian crew (like Italian Homemade) with many Italian customers. The staff is attentive and very, very friendly.I'm a big Arrabiata fan and I have to say that their version was outstanding. The sauce had the right amount of spice, little chunks of fresh tomatoes (I think cherry), and flakes of parsley and oregano. Very delicious!!We ordered a simple pizza and while it didn't have a particularly outstanding crust, the toppings were first class. The oven is a simple 3 level gas unit (not wood fired) and in all honesty - if I was going just for pizza - I'd go to Tony's (a block away). They were thoughtful enough to provide a small dish or olive oil with soaked pepper flakes with the pizza -- a nice touch!But for a combo pizza and pasta lunch or dinner, this place is a winner. There were a number of families there for lunch, some with small kids. It's a perfect place families.They don't have a liquor license yet so bring your own wine if you want. They do have a wide selection of soft drinks and sparkling water.We will definitely be back!!!!

Stumbled across this pizzeria while walking past and popped in. I was surprised by how good the pizza was. I highly recommend it. They sell "pizza al taglio" in the traditional Italian style. If you love Italian pizza you will love piccolo forno. You won't be disappointed. Nice ambiance for a family or with friends. Casual. Very clean. Good variety of pizzas. You won't be disappointed.

Piccolo Forno is the real deal-- genuine, honest Italian food, the kind one finds when traveling in Italy. Owner and main man Giuseppe hails from Lucca and he and his staff strive to deliver freshly prepared pastas, pizzas, and Italian style vegetables that please the palate and the wallet. They don't yet have their liquor license, but bring your own bottle of wine and they will supply the glasses. Buon appetito!

We loved our visit to San Fransico, We rode the wheels off the hop on buses and walked for miles. As we walked down Columbus street one day i stuck my head in the door of this little Italian restaurant. Sometimes you just know that this is going to be the place. We ended up having lunch there and managed to have dinner there twice before our visit was over. The second and third time we were in Giuseppe the owner greeted us as old friends. The bolognese pasta sause that Giuseppe is serving here is only equaled by the sauce Roberto makes at Fiorenza in San Jose Del cabo. It was a little tough getting seated sometimes because of the size of the place and the locals know a good thing when they find it. What a great restaurant. We met wonderful people there while dining both evenings! Thank you Giuseppe for the fabulous meals and great service. We hope to see you again and best wishes in the future.

No lie. My husband is the pickiest eater. He complains all the time when we dine out. And full disclosure: we had picked out an Italian restaurant across the street. We discovered they did not sell alcohol. I have to have wine with Italian. So I left and headed to Piccolo's on Columbus St. They greeted us and stated that currently they do not sell wine. But the store next door did. So we went next door and purchased a bottle of vino. My husband, son and I ordered an eggplant penne dish, spaghetti and lasagna. Mind blown. Best we have EVER had. Perfectly seasoned. Authentic Italian to perfection. And the tiramisu wasFluffy decadently amazing. Eat here And be sure to thank me.

Walking down Columbus Avenue on a Sunday night, we found many choices for Italian restaurants. North of Washing Square, it gets a little quiet and dark. Pressing on, we found Italian Homemade. The line wasn't long but there was only a table available with 1 stool. Our party of four decided to go across the street to Piccolo. So glad we did. There were tables and chairs and a waiter to take our order! We enjoyed spaghetti and meatballs, fettuccine alfredo, veal tortellini, lasagna, and pizza. Each entree is priced at around $15. Best prize goes to the lasagna! Service was quick and unpretentious. The only ding is this place has no alcohol. The table next to ours went down the street and brought back some beer.

Piccolo Forno is an excellent Italian restaurant in North Beach.I ordered the special, a breaded pork medallion and it was superb. The seasoning was tasty and the sauce was elegant. The price was reasonable; I think it was about $16 for the port medallion and vegetables.The waiter was helpful in making recommendations.The restaurant is small but that has a nice touch. Piccolo Forno also offers a variety of pizzas in addition to traditional Italian dinners. I recommend this place. The only downside is that there is no private parking lot; metered street parking only.

Went here based on reviews and was not disappointed. After spending $60 on Hot Dogs and basic concession food at Pier 39 spending $80 for dinner for 3 including dessert/salad and 3 main courses to share felt like an absolute steal. Had Lasagna, Pizza and Cheese Stuffed Tortellini and all were great but the Lasagna was best I've had in quite awhile. Desserts all good and must leave room. Tiramisu was what you would expect but my daughter had the Orange Sorbet and it was the best I've ever had. Was an actual orange scooped out with sorbet served inside and the sorbet was delicious and not over flavored or sugary like you get at the store. Servers were very nice and were running all over the place to keep up with everyone. Looked like they could have used one more to help out. Only complaint is it's very small and a bit cramped but that's just about par for the course anywhere . You won't be diaappoited!

There are hundreds of Italian joints in the area around Washington Park. VERY small inside and no reservations. Keep in mind or as a "back up" if you can't get in to a "fancier" place of your choice - just walk on over!Very authentic, the owner/cook greeted us as he was waiting for more help to arrive. Spoke in heavy Italian accent and very accommodating. Another waiter zooms up on Vespa with cigarette hanging out, dressed in black and white. Parked out front. Awesome. Jumps in and starts cleaning/setting up immediately. Several locals come and go and grab pizza slices. Many speak Italian.They have way more then just pizza though. Not quite a full Italian menu, but pasta, ravioli, gnocchi, etc. all fresh and very good. NO alcohol - but bring in a bottle (several places near to grab a bottle) and they will open and pour in wine glass for you. Reasonable prices for SF area (4 can eat for under $100)

Both the fresh pasta (I had it with some of the best pesto ever) and the homemade pizza (they will make it to order, combining toppings you want) are delicious. This is a new store-front restaurant that will serve you a sit-down meal or make food (including square pieces of pizza--as in a Roman pizzeria) to go. Service by the owner chef Giuseppe and staff is attentive. Just a great new addition to SF.
