We had an outstanding dinner with excellent service. The Butter chicken curry was delicious . The lamb vindaloo was pretty hot/spicy but terrific. We have lived overseas and have missed wonderful Indian food. This was just what we hoped for. Can't understand one of the previous reviews , maybe an off day but completely disagree. The wine list was pretty good as well.

Cant expect better food (vegetarian) in SF than what i had at Amber. its a beautiful fine dining restaurant located very near to the Moscone Centre/ Yerba Beuna/ SFMoMA. Closes at 10pm Sharp. Brie was one of the Best Captains i have seen, keeping her eyes on the order status, its proper service to the individual clients and follow up on the quality of the food. Little expensive IMO. Being made to order each time, it does take a little while to serve the food but with good company and a penchant of having good Indian Food in SF, the wait is worth it! Thank You Amber Team.

Delicious, and just right for a relaxed dinner!

My daughter and I love Indian food, so we wanted to eat at an Indian restaurant on our one free night in town. There is a more casual one nearby on 3rd St I have been to several times, but I was looking for one step up in the ambiance, and found it with Amber. It is a spacious and pretty room right near Yuerba Buena, and the waitstaff was very good. We really enjoyed the food, and at under $25/entree felt the prices were decent and were stuffed in the end after one appetizer to share, one entree each and a side of plain naan. I see the reviews of this restaurant as overpriced, but maybe they haven't tried to have a sit down meal in SF lately. :) I recommend it if you are in the area.

Simply terrible food if you are used to good Indian food, but if you don't know what Indian food tastes like, you may actually like it! Very noisy - the tables are extremely close to each other and small! You will want to avoid for a business lunch...

Dinner with a friend. We were seated in the bar area, and had some trouble getting attention from the staff to be served, but once they were aware of our presence, service was fairly good. The food was decent. My friend ordered a vegetarian curry and asked about the presence of squash, to which she is allergic, in the dish; she was told very quickly that there was none, but there turned out to be a good quantity of it in her choice. Otherwise, we enjoyed our meal.

Group of 4 - limited wine list and then was told twice they didn't have my selection. Beer also limited. Food came way too quickly and was only warm (made me believe it came from buffet in kitchen). Rice extremely disappointing and naan dry and cold. Chicken and sea bass dishes were tasty. Best dish was the aloo gobi- very tasty and favourable. Also the only hot dish. Service was good and evening enjoyable but would not go back nor would I recommend it. Not very authentic. Coffees were good.

I visit Amber at least once or twice a year but it's always been for their lunch buffet. This was my first time having dinner here. I brought a large group from work and everyone left absolutely satisfied and happy with the meal. The Palak Chaat is an absolute must for an appetizer. Very light and fresh. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but I'd recommend the Lamb Loin Masala for lamb lovers. The Sea Bass Curry is also a winner!

We have visited this restaurant several times in the past, as couples, as family and even for a business meeting. This restaurant is in a prime location off Market Street and has fairly good ambiance. Restaurant also provides good food and if you are there for dinner, the quantity served is good for the price. However; this was our first experience at the lunch buffet. Sadly, the experience was not the same as dinner experiences. We found the food to be expensive, the choices were not as expansive as the price and the service was ok given that it was self serve buffet.

Lamb was tough. Curries were mediocre. Not many gluten free options. Service was spotty. Initial service was good. But we needed to be moved as the appetizers arrived because the table next to us felt compelled to share their female conquests in graphic detail so our children could hear. The waiter was very nice about moving us. Our new waiter proceeded to ignore us for 30 minutes and seemed disinterested after that. Also disappointing that the happy hour deals are not available in the dining room (the woman seating us seemed offended when I asked). Every meal we ate in San Francisco was outstanding - except for this one.

If it was only about food I would have given Amber a "Very Good", but my experience was terrible. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. So far I haven't come across a good Dal Makhni in any of the restaurants here in SF so I thought of checking with the management here if the Dal Makhni they serve, is what I am looking for. I wanted to be sure its Urad and not masoor. My server turned out to be an american guy, I didnt want to confuse him with my questions about masoor and urad ( I know I can be very silly sometimes ) so I checked with the indian manager, who just crossed our table and he assured me its going to be the Delhi Dal Makhni. I had no freaking idea that I had just offended the server by not asking him this question. The guy didn't turn up to take the order. I had to ask the manager to take our order since the server could not be seen anywhere and we had been waiting for like 20 minutes. The food came in, nobody to serve again. We chose to ignore this and relished the food. We wanted another round of naans but now again, whom should we reach out to. So we caught hold of the manager again. Our angry server came with the naans and just banged them on the table. We were taken aback with his actions. Once we finished eating, we waited for someone to come with the bill but, well as we expected, there was noone. I actually wanted to step out without paying since, well nobody seemed to be interested in getting paid. My husband just went to the billing corner and paid the bill since this was getting too much to handle and we were losing it now. The food was good but a good experience is what you are looking for when you take your parents out for dinner. This was their first dinner in SF, they had come from India just a day before, I wanted it to be special but whoa I am definitely not coming here again!

I am an Indian and while visiting US for a few days, I usually not indulge in eating Indian food- I love trying different cuisines. This time around post 10 odd years of frequenting SFO, I happened to visit Amber with friends who were keen on Indian food due to a longer haul in town. I had a recommendation from a close foodie friend, he had asked me to try their Mirch Salaan (Jalapeno Pepper Curry), I must say, I haven't had a dish as delicious as that anywhere outside of India or even in majority of India-- just yum! Well, couldn't resist myself-- heard they do an open lunch buffet during afternoons so took another friend along. We batted really well (if you are an Indian, you'd know what I am saying), it implies, we extracted the full value for our money and ate really well. Every dish I could lay my eyes upon and then taste was just so perfectly cooked, everything was delicious. Great staff and hospitality too-- have a decent bar set-up too, loved it. Must recommend it to you if you are keen on some yummy Indian cuisine in SFO. Cheers!

While the foods pretty good, service at such an elegant restaurant is surprisingly subpar. We had to serve our own food from the trays as our server decided to run off as soon as he dumped the food on a service table behind us. Part of the order was never served, and when we asked him to cancel the items that never showed up, he said "oh you don't want it?" I mean why would we order something we didn't want? Anyways, I don't recommend this restaurant as the experience of the food is not good enough to tolerate unfriendly behaviour. Krisana was our server. The restaurant should take note of his attitude.

I've enjoyed many Indian meals over the years and I was excited about visiting here as the menu choices looked intriguing.The spinach starter was tasty but a little greasy.

We ordered two appetizers...one cauliflower and one crab thing and 3 entrees (one eggplant, one lobster curry, and one chicken). All of the dishes were average at best. The chicken was dry. The crab appetizer we did not even finish. The lobster dish was bland and the eggplant dish was slimy and sweet.I can't believe the place is getting such good reviews because virtually every dish we had there..except the cauliflower was worse than what I would expect from a CHEAP Indian food restaurant.The service was pretty crappy as well. It took a long time for our order..and then they asked us how our food was right after we got it..and the people who removed the dishes literally spilled food on me clean the plates.This would be fine in a dinner but at the price of the food, I would expect a lot more professionalism and knowledge on how to do this stuff less intrusively.I guess people think this place is great because I see great reviews, but at any price this place could at best be described as average and at fine dinning prices this place it poor to terrible.

This was helpful as it was raining.The food was delicious. We were a little early so had drinks in the bar area. It was nice and informal. For the main meal, we sat in the main lounge. The food was excellent. I had jackfruit fritters for the first time! We did not mind the pricing as we knew beforehand that it is an expensive place (considering it is downtown SFO). The tables were however very cramped and our chairs were touching those of our neighbours! Service was pleasant and made up for the tight seating. Overall, an excellent experience. I would have given it a 5 if it were not for the seating. Will go again.

The price is 25-35 per dish. I don't mind paying that at all but it's not as creative or fresh as some of the newer places. I'd rather spend my money at Rooh. But if you are in the neighborhood and want a solid choice for Indian this is your place.

My in-laws took us to Amber for lunch. It was an all you can eat Indian buffet full of a wide variety of well prepared Indian cuisine. The large number of customers of Indian heritage was my indication that the food must have a very authentic quality. Although I am allergic to a large number of items typically used in this cuisine (lemons and cucumbers just to name two), I was able to find plenty to enjoy. The rest of the family was equally if not more happy since they could indulge in many more of the offerings.

I associate Indian restaurants with a certain vibe and 3rd worldiness. So the first time I saw Amber it looked too slick and I decided against going there. An Indian Lyft driver, when I'd ask him to recommend a resto in SF, had said that Amber was the best.Tonight, however, I gave it a chance and definitely understand why he said that. What a menu. Like nothing I'd seen before in an Indian resto. And the plates delivered on the promise. Also, creative cocktails.

Stopped in for dining solo. Sat on the side, facing a wall which wasn't so great. I ordered the butter chicken and papadum. The chicken was nicely done but had flecks of bone with the meat being a bit dry and stringy. Service was harried (not hurried) but timely overall. Price to quality was average. The papadum were nicely done and flavorful. I'd come back but would bring a guest. Staring at that wall was a bummer!

The food is really good but slightly expensive. The staff is very nice and friendly. We arrived when it was almost the closing time but they didn't turn us down. They are really quick. We ordered and the food was on our table in 10 minutes. The place is small and cosy and we had a really nice time. Good place to visit if you're looking for authentic Indian Mughlai cuisine.

An incredible great smell when you enter the place

I really did not expect what I got. Great smell when I entered the restaurant.Nice location which much smaller than it was at the end. But still feels cosy because of the way it is build. You sit a little bit low for my feeling on the sofas. Food was very good although we only had a little bit. Was a business meeting

Worth a vist!

Food was excellent, as was the service. Great ambiance and very reasonably priced. We try to go on every trip to San Fran, easy walk from the St. Francis where we usually stay. Go, you won't be disappointed!

Great food and a nice buzzy ambience. We ate here on a Saturday night and had booked fortunately because it was very busy. No problem though - the food and service were excellent. Highly recommend it but be aware that the meals are pretty spicy!

Racist manager..

I had the worst experience in this restaurant. The manager was so rude and racist and he judged is based on our country. My first card was declined but my brother's card worked. Then I gave the server another card and he charged the whole amount on my card. I wanted to speak with the manager and when he came he thought that I didn't want to buy and he said "go back to your country you are not welcome here" and "I know people like you" . Just because I wanted to speak to him and explain that my card was changed the full amount and my brother card was changed also, he assumed that I didn't want to buy and he kicked us outside although it was the severe mistake. I felt embarrassed and humiliated and I wanted to explain but he wouldn't give a chance. This is discrimination and I honestly thought about calling the police because I didn't do anything wrong.

Best Indian Food- Intoxicating Favors!

Not knowing much about Indian Food, we were following the recommendation of the concierge at the Marriot Marque located around the corner from the Amber who said this was one of the best Indian restaurants in the city. We have never had so many unique, intoxicating flavors and aromas in one meal. Every appetizer and entree we experienced was unbelievably delicious. The subtle flavors were so inter-woven and unique. We went back to try them again-it was an experience that made us pursue Indian Food many times again. 

Excellent dinner!!

We went there on a busy Friday night, and since we did not have a reservation, we decided to save a 1-hour wait for a table and to sit at the bar. This was a great choice, however. The service is good and fast, the atmosphere is very relaxing, and most importantly, the food is extremely delicious. Definitely visit if you are in the mood for a great Indian food!

Superb Indian food, with great service

In the heart of SF, if you are looking for a good Indian meal, this is the place. Fantastic food, good servings quantum, great service. Slightly pricey, but I guess we pay for the quality.Only wish the front staff are more friendly at the time of allocating you the tables. Or may be just an off day they had when we visited

My last meal in earth

My daughter exclaimed after her meal that she would want this food if it was her last meal on earth. Teenagers can be a bit dramatic but the food is heavenly. I recommend reservations. My daughter wanted to get dressed up and this restaurant has the perfect ambience. The butter chicken melts in your mouth. It is on the pricey side but worth the experience especially if celebrating a special occasion.

Amber is a casual, lively restaurant with a few seats at the bar. Convenient downtown location on Market between Powell and Montgomery. They offer a variety of curry pots, as well as many other Indian dishes. My husband, who is not a big fan of Indian food, raved about how good it was. Do not overlook.

Delicious dinner. Chilean sea bass is my favorite & a glass of wine. Wonderful atmosphere. Very busy, so reservations are recommended.

Excellent weekend buffet!

Very centrally located and nice ambiance. Being of Indian heritage and from a foodie family, I am fussy. But this place is pretty good. I had an a la carte dinner once a few years ago, and it was good too but a little too pricey, so I've stuck to the Sat/Sun buffet and haven't been disappointed. My favorite is the dosa station where a chef cooks crispy rice pancakes on demand. The buffet usually has a good selections of vegetable, meat and fish dishes, though I'd like to see more fish and more of a variety with the sauces. Also, the servers are responsive but it would be nice if they were a little more friendly and relaxed. There is an attractive bar and I love the all you can drink mimosas during the weekend!

This is by far the best Indian food I've had at a restaurant anywhere. The butter chicken was AMAZING. The naan was perfect. Our server, Briana, was so wonderful and helpful. She really made it all around a good experience. I got a bad/rude vibe from the hostess when we first walked in, but luckily we had Briana as our server. The tables are all candlelit and the aesthetic of the restaurant is gorgeous and chill af. 

Impressive!!
