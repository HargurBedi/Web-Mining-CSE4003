The "mini" burgers are definitely big enough! 4oz of delicious burger. Add one of their chocolate chocolate milkshakes with that and they're hot out of the frier French fries and it's a great late night quick grab. I only wish there was more seating! It's always a good sign of great food though when there's no where to sit!

As vegetarian eaters getting a great burger is not always easy, these were amazing burgers. In fact everything here was tasty, hot and a great sized portion, we had a burger each and shared fries. Yes it was busy and not the cheapest eat but this was overshadowed by the fact the food was good as was the service.There are several around town and worth a stop

I'm not sure there's a time when they're not busy, but I didn't have to wait long to order or to get my food. The location on Market is easy to get to from every direction.I haven't been to all of the west coast chains, but there are not many burgers anywhere that compare for flavor and juiciness to the super burger I had there. It was delicious!I'm not sure if the garlic fries will appeal to everyone, but I loved them. I was lucky enough not to share an elevator with anyone after that meal, but they were so darn good.I'll be back the next time I'm in the area.

Visited on the strength of the reviews and having people say that it was better than In-N-Out Burger. There was one person taking orders which meant the line was huge. We also had to wait about 10 minutes after ordering to get our food. Not fast food. The burger itself was delicious, but nothing exceptional.

Very good burger, full of flavour with a good dressing and sides for only $12 (inc drink) is good for the area being central SF. Burgers aren't huge, but they're good quality and seemed to have a messaging around sustainability of their suppliers.

Simple, yet excellent burger with fast service. The place is small but we managed to get a seat even though it was very busy. Visiting and tried for the first time and glad we did. I wish we had one of these back home. We just had a basic cheeseburger to test the waters and they were great. Both the regular and garlic fries are delicious (only complaint is we wished the cheese was a little melted on the fries so it stuck to them better but we made it work). Oh yeah, and if you like pickles you can get fresh housemade pickles free.

When it comes to burgers I can be somewhat picky so very few if any places are ever going to get 5 stars :) as burger places go this one is pretty good with a reasonably large menu to pick from and some beer selections too. Price wise I'd say it's reasonably priced, certainly not too pricey. Service is quick and in the common way these days you're given a buzzer device to let you know when your food is ready. The food itself I found to be good - for my taste the burger patties are maybe a little on the crisp side but still good and the garlic fries are absolutely excellent. In my opinion this is certainly a better place to go than in 'n' out - but I realise that's probably a bit controversial for anyone who is from California :)If you're nearby and want a burger - it's certainly worth a visit.

A perennial debate will be where to eat burgers in the US. There is not one single answer, but if you have a craving around midnight like I did you could do a lot worse than Super Duper. It's juicy, fresh, the fries are good and there's a decent offering of beers and wines too if the bottomless Coke or root beer doesn't take your fancy. You can get a good meal for $15, totally worth it in this part of town.

My family wanted a quick meal before we set out to explore San Francisco. The high ranks on this burger place made us almost run there. We are huge fans of BurgerFi and Super Duper almost matched their quality. All of the burger lovers in my family were impressed by the quality of the burger, toppings, and bun. They were not huge and thick burgers, but were substantial in size. The pickles they have on their self service stands were DELICIOUS! Make sure to try those! Their menu is more extensive than many of the quick service burger places. They had veggie options and chicken burgers. Also, they had a chicken sandwich that was truly chicken, not a pressed patty. The highlight, other than the pickles, had to be the garlic fries! YUMMY! Luckily, we all ate some, so nobody was offended by garlic breath ... :-) This is not fine dining and not fast food, it is somewhere in the middle... but it is very good for what it is! :-)

Food was very tasty, the service was great and quick.

Overall a very affordable place to catch a bite to eat while shopping in the city.

We were on a family vacation to California starting in San Francisco. Upon our check in at the hotel, we asked for a burger place recommendation and were directed to Super Duper - best choice ever! We ordered the cheeseburger combo and were so impressed with the quality and the taste. The next day, we had breakfast there and were equally impressed with the egg sandwich and went back again for breakfast on our last day in SF. This place is a gem ... too bad that they only have locations in SF :( Please consider opening in Toronto (Canada)!

While in San Francisco, we came upon this joint and when we saw the line we were intrigued. The look and feel, service and quality of food was very good, but the burger lacked flavor. In N Out and Shake Shack have the most flavorful burgers hands down. Not sure if it's the perfect combo of salt n pepper or cook time or what, but all I know is when you have a super flavorful burger you know it and I did not have this experience at Super Duper Burgers. Besides the burger however, their fries are interesting, the complimentary pickles are insane and the organic swirl ice cream is excellent. Overall I would say this place is certainly worth checking out.

My 3 teenagers and I ate dinner here on our first night in the city to try out their burgers. My two noys and I truly enjoyed the flavorful but messy burgers. My daughter wasn't as thrilled with the chicken sandwich. The fries were basic and good but the garlic fries were unique. If you love garlic they are fabulous. If not they are overwhelming. The shakes were pretty good but a little watery. The service was excellent. The seating was limited and we ate standing up. If you like a good burger this place is worth a visit.

I wanted to check out 'Super Duper Burgers' so badly, from friends' word of mouth. I finally got my chance to check out 'Super Duper' after our family trek to 'Haight/Ashbury' for the 50th Anniversary of 'The Summer of Love' last Saturday June 24th, 2017 (The restaurant's location was in the heart of Downtown San Francisco on Mission (near the Powell St. BART Station). My brother had a single cheeseburger, while this bear had the Triple Cheeseburger with a split of garlic fries. The burger was way too greasy for my liking, and my brother didn't care much for his burger. Maybe I'm getting spoiled here, but 'In & Out' and 'The Habit' does better Burgers than these guys. The garlic fries were 'blandish' as well. The location of this particular restaurant was perfect, as people were coming from SF Pride festival constantly. Though I went to Haight/Ashbury on Sat and SF Pride on Sunday - the best chance of my visiting this place was after the Saturday visit to The Haight. I'm glad we did! Three Claws Up!!! Gay friendly.

Perfectly cooked hamburgers - we went for cheese and bacon with all the additional toppings and were not disappointed. Perfectly crispy and salty bacon, the sauce is delicious. We also had garlic fries which were overloaded with cheese (no complaints here!) crispy and golden - just the right amount of salt and maybe a little too garlicky for a date night (but hey - I loved them!). Really reasonably priced for the quality!

This was across our hotel. We saw it was high rated on trip advisor so we checked it out. Ambiance is great for a fast food joint. It has ample comfy seating and is clean and hip looking. The prices are expensive but I suppose the prices are justified by the location (paying the rent) and the ingredients- some are organic. However, that being said, I found the cheeseburger messy and waaay too oily. It was dripping all over the place. Also their shakes were pricey and just okay. Tastey, but if I had a choice between the two, I would rather save money and go to an In and Out Burger which I honestly found just as tasty.

We live in the state that is home to In-N-Out Burger so it's pretty hard to impress us in the burger department. Five Guys is good, Habit is yummy too. While visiting SF, we decided to give Super Duper a try. We were not disappointed. The burger was juicy and tasty. Fries were good too. I wasn't crazy about the pickles only because I like my pickles IN my burger. Their homemade pickles are cut in big chunks which makes it super hard to eat IN a burger.Overall a good experience.Side note: We visited on a weekday about 11:30am. By the time the noon hour hit, the line was out the door with the lunch hour crowd. If you have a choice, go before or after the noon hour.

or so they say :) Food was great. Garlic fries were very garlic-y but yummy. Great for a quick bite to eat and lots of options.

Good burger and service

Burger was very good, cooked perfectly Lady who served me gave me some great advice on other places to try Everything there is eco friendly like the wrapping paper of the burgers, all compostable! 

Great place!

Stopped in for a quick lunch and wasn't disappointed. Ordered the veg burger(I know, but I'm currently living a plant based existence). Hummus and cucumber on the bun, it was delicious. Went back for another one. Fair prices and good food. Give it a try. 

Must come here everytime I visit San Francisco

Now, you might be thinking how could a chain burger joint could even be that good? I've had past experience where chain restaurants were quite overrated but this place is an exception. I was skeptical the first time I was visiting this place 2 years ago but to my shock, the burger was one of the best burger of this type I've ever eaten. These days, every time I visit San Francisco I make sure to visit 2 places and Super Duper is one of them. Their fries weren't that good in the past but they've even improved them. Definitely try out their burgers if you get the chance. You won't believe how good it tastes for a burger that seem to only have the basic stuff like tomatoes, onions, lettuce etc.

Okay but don't see what all the fuss is about

Convenient location on Market Street.Average service, average food & drinks, for a burger joint. Nothing amazing so I struggle to understand what all the fuss is about?

A good find.

Situated right across from our Marriott Marquis hotel, great choice with lots of organic foods. Excellent service, very friendly staff also very clean. Juicy organic chicken burger well recommended and given the price for food in San Francisco this place is a little gem!

We are a simple burger loving family, so when I found Super Duper burgers via trip advisor we had to give it a try. Boy, was it a good choice. Burgers were delicious, but all are cooked medium(if this bothers you, it may not be a pleasant experience). Burgers are 4oz or Supers (doubles) 8oz, then you add cheese or bacon for additional cost. Toppings are included: lettuce, tomato, sauce. We also got fries and garlic cheese fries; a big indulgence for me but even my kids loved them. Pickles are fresh and available on the counter and are awesome. Fountain drinks and bottled drinks available as well as shakes. Definitely recommend!!!*I won't fault ignorance or marketing on vegetarian fed beef, but cows don't eat one another or any other animals; strictly grass and corn. (If they do, perhaps I need new cows ) 

Nice burger !

Food here was enjoyable and quite big portions at least compared to ones in U.K. If not America, would of loved to upgraded the chips or fries as Americans say lol but simply wouldn't been able to eat it all - I'm not a big eater !!! Lol

Best Veggie Burger ever!

Loved Super Duper Burger. Visited twice and it's always really busy as it's very popular. Great food and the service is awesome and fast. The staff clearly really care! Honestly the nicest veggie burger I've ever had. The fresh lemonade is also delicious! They have a great environmental policy too as everything they serve with is recyclable which I think is fantastic. Go go go to Super Duper Burger!! 

Great place for a burger near Cow Hollow!

Found this gem on TripAdvisor and it hit the spot for a burger and fries. They weren't the best I have ever had, but definitely a place I would go back to. My friend liked them better than me. The burgers were cooked medium, which was awesome because some places can overcook the burger.

WOW - possibly the best burgers ever!!

I stopped by here on the way back from a late night out in San Francisco, and it was a revelation. So much so that in the course of three days, I visited thee times.These burgers are beautiful - I'm pretty sure it's the sauce, but I think it's also that they're not too salty - which does seem to be a tendency with food in the US. I didn't have the fries, but I can also vouch for the super shakes!!!These dudes definitely need to come to the UK. And soon.

Seriously good burger (and ice cream)

Went in here as was passing by. Got a cheeseburger and was delicious. From the UK so we don't get great burgers. Miles better than a lot of burgers I've had (including in and out). Free pickles and garlic chips are great. Also choc dipped ice cream was fun to have. Would recommend trying even their mini burger if passing by just to taste!
