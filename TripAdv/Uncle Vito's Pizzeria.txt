We first heard about Uncle Vito's from the staffers who were working on the cable car we were on. They were busy placing their lunch order, which they would pick up during their run down to the bottom of Powell Street, and then eat when they had returned to their stop near Fisherman's Wharf. Well, when locals recommend something, it's got to be good right? And it was. My husband split a spaghettini and meatballs with garlic bread, and loved it. The meatballs were moist and tasty, the spaghettini was cooked to al dente perfection, and the garlic bread was nice and flaky.The dining room is small and unpretentious, and the service was good. We had actually passed by this restaurant before as our hotel was close by, but had decided to dine elsewhere. We're so glad now we overheard the cable car workers discussing their lunch!

I went there for dinner. When a small table opened up, the waiter wanted to give the table to a party of three that had arrived after me. When I pointed out that I had been waiting longer than the other party, he told me that he was just following orders. Apparently, management is more concerned about their profit than their customers.

Honestly, if I was taking only my own views into account, I'd give it three stars. I thought the experience was average: average pizza, average service, average prices for a pizza place. Not bad average, but just a pleasant yet not overly memorable experience. However, they accomplished a great feat: my father-in-law, who detests pizza, and who I have never seen eat pizza in the 6 years I've been part of the family, ate their pizza and even said is was good (with the qualifier "for pizza"). If the place could convince him to not only try the pizza when a burger was available on the menu, but also enjoy it, there must have been a special something that I just didn't catch.

We visited this restaurants as we fancied pizza. The restaurant was extremely busy and we waited c30 mins for a table. We were seated upstairs above the kitchen and then waited a further 10 mins for a waitress to come and take a drinks and food order. I was a little bit put out that the waitress took the order of a table that had been seated a good 5 mins after we had been seated. Pizza arrived and I was a little disappointed as the base felt and tasted a little over cooked.

I had just started a load at a nearby laundromat and was after a beer. Fortunately I happened across Uncle Vito's. I was with 2 others and we thought we could go a couple bits of pizza each so ordered a medium 'the mountain'. It was outstanding! We also managed a pitcher of beer and all in time to return to begin the dry cycle. I thought the place was great value and it offered more than exactly what I was after. Recommended to all kiwis looking for a relatively cheap meal when visiting San Fran and staying nearby

It has nothing to do with the real Italian pizza. It was heavy, fat and full of cheese. In Italy they are using mozzarella cheese... The pizza dough was bone-dry.

This little place was close to our hotel and after a long day of sightseeing we just wanted something for takeout to enjoy in our jammies back at the hotel. Only had to wait about 20 minutes on a busy night for them to have a pizza ready for us. Seemed to have been a trend as there were alot of people coming and going. My only critic would be to have a better place for all of us takeouters to have a better holding area. We kept feeling like we were in the way of the servers. Pizza was fresh and hot when we got back to our room and the girl at the checkout was very obliging to provide plates and utensils. Yep we're those people who use knives and forks. They helped secure and cozy dinner in for us and we were grateful.

pizza was tasty, but had to much crust. I normally eat it but me and the rest of our party of 11 left it on the plate. The staff did make room for us which was a big plus. They don't have much room and fitting a party of 11 isn't easy.

After reading reviews we decided to try Uncle Vitos. There was a 35 minute wait for a table, (you have to put your name on the list) but we took this as a good sign. I ordered Lasagne and my boyfriend had the Mountain pizza, both were very fresh, tasty and good value for money. The staff worked so hard to see that no one waited too long for their order. They could really do with some AC as the restaurant was uncomfortably warm.

We were recommended this little restaurant by our air hostess on the flight to San Francisco, but warned it could get busy. It was on that night, a long queue, but the next lunch time we only had to wait ten minutes to get a table. Nice pizza, pasta and salads, and I understand why people queue, to get authentic Italian food at a reasonable price.

We come to San Francisco twice a year and a trip is not complete without a stop at Uncle Vito's! We really like the pizza here and usually make a stop late afternoon because it can get really busy. We get a table by the window and order a Veggie pizza with sausage! It is so good! All the veggies with the sausage make for a very tasty pizza with a very crisp crust. Can't wait for the next trip, looking forward to eating at Uncle Vito's!

I wanted a quick bite after work and headed into Uncle Vitro's for take-out. As promised, the line was long. Even for take-out, I had to wait some time. But the wait was well worth it. I had a special pizza - fresh sliced tomato and fresh minced garlic. The ingredients were fresh and mouth-watering! The pizza was baked to perfection and the aroma was all consuming! The only downside was that the tomatoes were diced instead of sliced, but equally juicy. Along with the pizza, I also had a spinach salad. It was topped with brown button mushroom slices and crunchy croutons. Again, it was very fresh. Will definitely be back next time in the city!

Uncle Vito's makes pizza like it should be made. We visited it twice during our stay in San Francisco, once to eat in and once to take away. The place was rammed on both occasions and people were queuing to get in, both locals and tourists. There's a great range of pizzas, all freshly made, the service is excellent and the restaurant is great value. I can't think of anything negative other than that you may have to wait a while but don;t be put off, it's well worth it!

Wow! What a great pizza restaurant! We read reviews before trying Uncle Vito's on Wednesday night so we expected it to be busy and it was but we were offered a table within 10 minutes. It was well worth the wait. We shared a small pizza and a small calzone with a side salad and we had trouble finishing. The pizza was so good, undoubtedly the best we have had as was the salad. The service was excellent and the prices very affordable. Give it a try if you are in the area and enjoy watching authentic pizza making while you wait.

Somewhat jet lagged on our second night in San Francisco, we headed out the three blocks from our hotel, and found Uncle Vito's. There were two families in front of us in the queue, but we think that means the place must be good, and to be honest, we just couldn't face moving on with the kids; it was late enough. We were so glad we stayed! The food was amazing, and a really good price, and the service good too. It was so good we decided to come back again tonight, but just that bit earlier so we were seated straight away! Yet another meal, we couldn't fault. Thanks Uncle Vito!

We waited for about 40 minutes to get seated( were told 15 minutes upon getting sighed in ) , the employees don't seem to too nice. We really like the Grilled Chicken breast fetuccine. The pizza was alright, but it wasn't anything to rave about. The service was horrible, we waited40 minutes to get seated, so one person in my group asked for a glass of water, the waiter said that he was busy that we just needed to wait . Needless to say he never brought the water. while serving the food , he just sort of tossed things like napkins, utensils, etc on the table. He handled money and food without gloves, etc. Overall, I read some reviews about the bad service , but I decided to try it anyways , because a lot of the reviews that the food was cheap and good tasting. I will upload a picture of the menu and you be the judge of that.

Dinner for Two

After a long day of sightseeing and using trip adviser to pick a place close to our hotel we settled on Vito's. Upon arriving we gave our names and asked for a table of two. We could clearly see that there was a table for 4 available but we were told to wait. In most countries you would be seated at this table. A group of 4 arrived 10min after us and were immediately seated at this table. When we asked the hostess we she merely replied "table for 2, yes". Eventually we were seated at a table for 2. By this stage all that kept us at this restuarant was the trip adviser reviews. We asked our waitress for a dry white wine, she replied a chianti is a good wine. Huh??? Which we returned explaining white not red!! She then suggested the Chablis and promptly brought us a Chardonnay. Not a good sign.We had the ceased salad which was tasty and a large portion. Easily shared. We then had the Mountain pizza which was very tasty but the crust was not your normal pizza crust it resembled more a pasty base so one had to cut the base and only eat the topping piece.The rating for this establishment should be reconsidered.

I am very surprised by the reviews and knowledge of wine in this town. One the pizza bases are like pastry. Two they have no clue about wine. We first sent a Chianti back and than where told they have some nice Chablis. When we received it we said its a Chardonnay from California. They said yes a Chablis?? 2013 way past it's sell by date. By this stage we just kept quite and paid. I do not rate the restuarant. They pack you in like sardines and give you very average food.

I'm sorry we never discovered Vito's when we lived in SF. We were here on a visit and read TA reviews so tried the pizza - terrific! It's done just right. Uncle Vito's is not at all fancy and there aren't a lot of tables. The pizza is fairly priced and we also shared the Greek salad - ample for two. If you want the salad first, be sure to ask as otherwise it's served with your pie. The service was fine. It's only two blocks from Union Square but the last block is pretty steep if you walk up Powell. Our bill for the large pie, salad and two beers was $33. How can you beat that in SF?

Do not believe the good reviews on this place as they must be either written by people with incredibly bad taste or the owners. To start the service was unbelievably rude and unwelcoming. The restaurant itself is filthy dirty and expect the food you would expect from the external appearance, BAD! The pasta was overcooked and sloppy, the pizza unrecognisable as Italian. Even the garlic bread was dry without enough butter. To sum it up the most horrible food you could eat in this rather unappealing area of Union square. Cheap and cheerful I guess if what you are after is CHEAP.

The basic cheese pizza was absolutely gorgeous. Rich tomato sauce and perfectly cooked cheese, the base was crispy and still gorgeously soft in the middle. At just over $16 for a 16" pizza it's a bargain anyway - but for that quality! So good we went back again! Try to get there early, seats get taken quickly and take away orders make the queues seem out of the door but the staff are excellent, good humoured and really friendly! Don't let a queue put you off, pop and give your name and then people watch!Can't recommend enough.

We were staying in an AirBnb in Nob hill, and we weren't in the mood to trudge to public transportation. I found Uncle Vito's a few blocks away. It's a very small restaurant and there was a significant line. We considered going elsewhere, but decided to stick it out. They moved people in and out pretty fast, and I think we only ended up waiting about 20 minutes, and for a party of 5, that's good. The teens and a couple adults ordered a cheese pizza, which they said was really good. I ordered a ravioli primavera dish and asked them to hold the mushrooms, which they did. It was excellent. Not a lot of vegetables (none, actually) but the flavor was excellent. My husband ordered a ravioli pesto dish which he also enjoyed. I felt like my meal was the caliber of something I would eat at a much more expensive restaurant. For the first time on our vacation in San Francisco, the bill didn't give us sticker shock, which was nice.

Then comes the food, wow just amazing it's lovely best meal we had in San Francisco and we tried slot of place up market and budget friendly! Would highly recommend

Just go in!

Doesn't look much from the outside but the pizzas are delicious. It's only a small place but the food is delicious and extremely good value. 

Pleasant experience with great food

Small two story pizza place. Great pizza. Server was busy, but provided top notice service. Table tops are for 2 to 5 people and seating is tight, but that is San Fran.

Try and confirm thats ok.....

Nice place, even with long line very fast. Pizza more than ok and specials without issues. Drinks cheap and near Union Square. If you want Italien food with nice prices you are right.

Nothing fancy but delicious

A friend had recommended this spot so we walked from our hotel. It was a bit of a walk (and uphill) but, as the title says, worth it. The restaurant was crowded and lots of people waiting for seats and take out which we took as a good sign. The prices were reasonable. Our waitress wasn't overly friendly but she was also super busy and the service was fast. We ordered the Mountain , the house pizza. It was very good. Not the best pizza we've ever but very, very good.

On our first night in the city, we checked into our Union Square hotel and were really hungry from driving for hours. We found Uncle Vito's on Trip Advisor, and it was just one block away. It was casual & reasonably priced, but when we arrived, was busy and had a wait. When we asked about getting on the list, they said 25 minutes, but when we said we would keep looking, he stopped me, double checked and said 5 minutes. We were seated w/in 2 min. The Caesar Salad was so good! My husband and I shared it. The portion was very generous. Five of us shared two large pizzas, and they were excellent! Exactly what you'd hope to be lucky enough to find in a family pizzeria in San Francisco. Awesome! Thank you for taking such good care of our family!

We waited in crammed full aisle for what we hoped was to be a quality pizza with peperoni, red oinions, roast peppers. Given how busy it was we figured the pizza must be good. Alas the crust was dry and unpleasant the oinions were not cooked fully, we did not finish it.

Seemed authentic

Both my daughter & I had pasta dishes here, it seemed to be the real deal. $3.75 for a pint of beer was pretty real too. Wanted to return to try a pizza, but hadn't time. Busy place.

Best pizza in town

We went there two times on our holidays in SF. Pizza, lasagne and salad was awesome. Service is really cool, the restaurant ist small but that's fine for me. And the best: you get a lot for your money. We will definitely come back.

We bungled into Uncle Vito's as we simply couldn't climb another hill without eating food. Immediate impression was mixed - place is small, venue has an authentic 'well worn' look about it, and the service was not prompt. If we weren't so hungry we may well have turned and left - delighted that we didn't.We were eventually given a rubbish seat somewhere in the corner of a tiny dining room, when the wine came it arrived in an unpretentious rocks glass - again, not giving us a great impression. Wine was superb though, and everything seemed to click thereafter.When the pizza arrived they were extremely fresh tasting, could understand why the place was so busy despite looking like little more than a pizza take away.Would definitely be back.

Excellent food at convenient price

Pizze cooked at your sight. Cheap drinks compared to the US average. Good service and most appropriate location. Great choice!

Great pizza and service

Very small place, but we were quickly seated upstairs. Enjoyed the pizza and the sausage sandwich. Service was great and the waitress ran up and down the stairs with the food! Also ordered takeout and were pleased.

Delicious Calzones!

I had the specialty calzone with pepperoni, salami, mushrooms, ricotta cheese and it was just fabulous! The crust was a great texture on both top & bottom - the 8" was plenty for me so order a small!

Average pizza. Small price

The title of this review says it all. Average food for a small price. Fennel doesn't belong on a pizza.

Delicious food. I had the calzone and my wife the chicken fettuccine. Both were really tasty. They're so busy, just expect so-so service. But don't let that keep you away!!!

Excellent local Italian restaurant. Wish we had found it sooner. Was not expensive. Cal zone was filled with lots of goodies. Special for the evening was terrific. Would go back when in San Fran. Not a fancy restaurant. ..

Very good pizza

It's not the most attractive of restaurants and very small. We weren't greeted upon arrival and there was nowhere for us to sit so we opted for a takeaway. The pizza was very good though and we would visit again, but not to eat there. The service was the worst we received on our 3 weeks in the US, a real disappointment. We appreciate that they were busy but walking past a customer and saying good evening or welcome, is not a big ask.

And you are taken back to the 70s, when the furniture was originally bought and the joint painted. That is a GOOD thing BTW. Everybody eats at UVP, from tech entrepreneurs and bankers to janitors, and they all get the same delicious, simple pizzas served with a smile on those metal plates I thought had disappeared with Y2K (photo). Add a beer or glass of wine and you will have a simply brilliant dinner experience you'll wish you had weekly (at least)

I had to leave as not felt welcome

This is a strange review as not based on food but on the bad manners given to me when I arrived in the place. we were left in a corner with 2 kids waiting and when we asked the menu we were given a poor piece of paper and when we asked questions we were ignored! We left before taking seat. not a great personell
