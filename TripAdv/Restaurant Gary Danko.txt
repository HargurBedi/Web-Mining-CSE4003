My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Gary Danko. As long time residents of Russian Hill, this is our favorite restaurant in San Francisco. In my opinion, it is far superior in service and cuisine than other top rated restaurants in the City. We have the luxury of many Michelin Star restaurants from which to choose and have dined at most of them. I would recommend Gary Danko without hesitation.

The service and food are beyond impeccable at Gary Dankos. I have had the pleasure of eating here a couple times and I will definitely be going back. At time it can take a bit of planning due to the fact they are a small wonderful place and they book two months in advance. Never fear there is bar seating as well so if you are short on time just plan to show up early and or late. You will not be disappointed, all of your senses will be satisfied.

A bit unsure of all the hype

We were visiting the city and Gary Danko was highly recommended by a local work associate. Overall the experience was above average but we left feeling a bit unsure about what all the hype was about.This is not a good place for a quiet romantic dinner as the tables are very close together. You are dining with your neighbors. The menu is expansive and the way you can put together a multi-course meal is appreciated. The starters were the best experience of the meal with the main course being solid but unremarkable.Can't really comment on the wine list because only went by the glass.Service was prompt and professional.Can't say it was one of our best meals ever, but certainly there are those who really enjoy the restaurant.

Wow, wow and wow!

We had the pleasure to dine at Gary Danko on our first evening in SF. We were seated on a side-by-side table which made the evening even more romantic. The great quality and taste of the full menu and the overall experience were total. Their wine selection was very broad and fitting all budget. Enjoy!

The welcome was warm, our head waiter both entertaining and professional, however, the food although very competent and pleasant was not outstanding- the starters were the highlight, the mains a little staid and perhaps designed so that they would never offend. The wine list is immense with prices commensurate for the high quality of wines they include- we chose and drank quality wines, however the sommelier tried to pass of a corked bottle of desert wine, which leaves a rather sour taste.Overall it was pleasant and a bit of a tick list- though perhaps they are trading a little on their reputation we wont be returning

Enjoyed dinner with 4 friends last week. Had a reservation snafu and was offered the private room for 2-1/2 hours gratis. As always, meal was superb (risotto with crab and shrimp, lobster with potato puree and medium rare beef steak with gnocci and greens...yep, too much food and I ate it all!) and of course service was excellent. The 5 of us ordered a variety of 3, 4 and 5 course meals and the plating and presentation was great. I love this place!

We flew in from the east coast and made a reservation here for 10 pm. We usually don't eat this late but we are glad we did. I love how they structured the tasting menu so you can pick any three, four or five selections. You can pick all apps if you want or all entrees or one of each. The quail was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant.

Instead, plan on spending at least $300 per couple for a three course dinner with wine, tax and tip. At the end of the meal, you will likely feel it is worth it. The three course dinner, price fixe, not tasting menu, goes for $87. The nice thing about it is that there are few, if any, supplements. Goose Liver, Osterea Caviar garnish, oysters, etc are included in the $87 price. The only flaw in the meal was the tendency of our waiter to try to rush us at the beginning of the service (trying to get us to order wine before we had selected our dishes, etc.). Once we refused to be rushed, he calmed down and the meal proceeded at a leisurely pace, which is what I expect at these prices.

This is one of the best restaurants i have eaten at in the world!! It is in a nice location and easy to get to on the cable car line. A few tips if you decide to go:1. you have to book 60 days in advance. This is the maximum number of days in advance that are allowed and they fill up that day;2. Do the chefs tasting menu which is amazing. There will accommodate any food allergies;3. I also recommend the wine pairings as they do a great job;4. They give you a muffin to take home for breakfast the next day which is delicious;5. I am not sure if they still do this but years ago they had a courtesy car that would drive you back to your hotel for free.Given the quality of food and level of service this restaurant is actually a great deal!

I am a selective eater but they were willing to work with me to find a dish I would like. I did think the seating was a little too close together. We were sitting very close to the table next to us. The bread was below average for a Michelin restaurant It was cold when it was served to us. The somm was over the top and knew his wines. For the money I feel there's better restaurants in SF. I wasn't overly impressed w the restaurant. I'm giving it 4 stars bc of our experience w the somm

Found the food & service to meet all the accolades I'd heard about. Perhaps one of the best lobster dishes I've ever tasted in my life (including my travels to Maine & the Northeast).

I think the food at Gary Danko is absolutely in line with the hype - it is truly fabulous. I found the dining room to be beautiful and subtle (and became even more so when they turned the lights down - perhaps too low). Once most of the loud Bay Area show offs finished dining, the restaurant became even more attractive once it became quieter (as it was quite noisy at the beginning of our reservation at 9 PM). I was not particularly impressed with the service team - I expected a team that would be a subtle and refined as the food. This is not the case - they are both loud and a little clumsy. Not subtle at all. But the ultimately got the job done and the food took us to the place we wanted to be (heaven). The manner in which the dishes were served (choreographically) was absolutely perfect.I was expecting the prices to be through the roof, but I will say that the tasting menu and the options for 3, 4 or 5 courses was both thoughtful and well priced. I also was worried that the quantity of food would be insufficient and I was absolutely thrilled with the portion sizes.My risotto was genuinely superb - a perfect temperature. The lobster was prepared to perfection and the bison was cooked exactly to my specifications. Special kudos for the quality of the cheese cart - there were at least four selections (out of the more than 15) that were genuine world beaters. I would return here. For a LATE reservation. Thanks to the excellent valet team as well.

The Service is unfortunately very arrogant. The Atmosphere is very cold and the place is extremely dark inside. You have to order at least three dishes and they are not flexible. The food is OK but not outstanding. I would not go back, nor can I recommend the place. It's very expensive for what it is. I was turned off by the service and by the atmosphere.

With only a couple of weeks' notice for our trip to San Francisco we were very fortunate to secure a reservation at Restaurant Gary Danko. After reading other reviews we had high expectations for this dining experience and on the whole we weren't disappointed. The 5-course tasting menu delivered a delicious and carefully crafted combination of dishes -- the horseradish-crusted salmon was especially exquisite. The wonderful selection for the cheese course was probably the best I've ever encountered in terms of both quality and variety. The accompanying paired wines were matched to perfection, with dish and wine highlighting each other's key points. This was my first fine-dining experience in the US and maybe it's common practice over there but I did find the overall service in the restaurant to be just a little impersonal and dare I say rushed. A random selection of serving staff and wine waiters appeared, in very quick succession, with different courses and I found it hard to establish a rapport such that I could comment on the wonderful treats we were being handed. A small blemish on an otherwise perfect evening.

My wife and I had dinner at Restaurant Gary Danko's as a first treat as part of our honeymoon and we were not disappointed!We booked ahead which I think was sensible as even in a Monday night the restaurant appeared at capacity. It's a 5 minute walk from Fishermans wharf.The service was impeccable, not overt the top but made us feel special throughout the meal.They have a great range of cocktails and beers (our preference) they also have an extensive wine list with some prices which would make one's eyes water!The menu is set up in quite a unique way. It's a set prices menu depending on the number of courses you choose to have. You and your fellow diners can choose from 3 to 5 courses and pick any combination (1 diner could say for example have three courses and the other diner have five courses - you can obviously share the courses with your partner had originally skipped). We really like this as I have a greater appetite than my wife (but as usual she managed to share the course she skipped!) . There is a varied choice of menu which caters for most tastes, we really loved this place and would happily go back there when next in San Francisco!

This restaurant deserves the Michelin star. From the very first moment we felt taken care of. Waiters & Waitresses were helpful in so many ways and were very knowlegeable about the dishes and drinks. I chose the 3 course menu $87.00. Others in our group chose differently. We tasted each others dishes. The dishes were impeccable and well presented. Probably any dish would make you feel pretty good. Yes it is expensive but in this case you really get what you pay for. We (six of us) were in the restaurant for two hours. We parked in the street as we were able to get a spot close to the restaurant, though parking is very tight. All of us received a nice going away present of a small individual cheesecake - very nice touch. For six of us the bill with all taxes, tips was about $1,000. (about $165 per person). Go there for a special occasion.

Incredible Restaurant. The food is superb. We both had the 4 course tasting menu. Each dish was absolutely perfect- taste, presentation. What stood out the most was the service. Beyond any kind of explanation! The staff is constantly watching every table, from making sure your bread plate is never empty, to refilling the water glass with the use of a napkin so that there are no splashes! Sam, although stood out the most. His professionalism was unreal! From the way he explained about each cheese, to every dish we asked about. He really should be in the restaurant/hotel hospitality business, far too incredible to be part of a wait staff. But back to the restaurant, worth every penny!!! They even give you a little trinket for the next morning! A delicious airy pineapple muffin! A must go to restaurant!!!!

We took some (foodie) friends here for dinner whilst on holiday last month. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the evening, we all thought the food was very good. Just a couple of things to point out, the amuse bouche was brought out before we ordered so we had to eat it whilst trying to juggle our menus. Also, although the cheese board was delicious, I was only offered bread with it. Some crackers would have been nice ( maybe that's a British thing!) But apart from that, all good. Excellent service ( staff everywhere!) Very busy so do book early.

We took a friend for a birthday. We were not impressed as we are from San Francisco and dine internationally and have high expectations when the price is this high. The food for the most part was delicious. But My partner's sea bass was too dry to be edible. You do not want to hear that abut a main course being to dry for that price.Plus the room was next to the bar and got intolerably loud. We were having to yell at each other to talk. And there were too many servers and dish handlers in the small room...hustling and bustling along and distracting us from our friends and the food. One server took the food right out of my friends hands as he was still eating,. Mh thought is they had a time frame and put great subtle pressure to move us along. Although we did not take too long. AND THEY FORGOT My FRIEND:S birthday and when we realized it it was too late. We know this is a great restaurant but they certainly had a bad day for us that day. We will not be back

Gary Danko is our top restaurant in San Francisco and has been almost since the day it opened. The menu is varied and creative and the dishes prepared to perfection. It is a fixed price 3, 4 or 5 course dinner. Although the menu has 5 sections, appetizers, seafood, meat, cheese and dessert, one can select multiple courses from the same section, 5 desserts if one so desires! The service is excellent, attentive but not overbearing. The cheese selection is one of the best one will see in a restaurant and the wine list quite extensive in all categories. Be prepared to spend but it is worth it.

Gary Danko has been a " bucket list " item for us for several years. It did not disappoint. First of all , the service was perfect. It was also great that they had a three course tasting menu- that is sufficient for us ( they also had options for additional courses). It was also a huge plus that we could choose our courses from any tasting menu. The cost was reasonable. And finally, the food was well proportioned and delicious.Gary Danko is not the best " fine dining" experience that I have had- but it is easily in the top five.

July 20th was our wedding day (we eloped to city hall) and picked Gary Danko as our special wedding day dinner. My husband let the reservationist know of our special day when he made the reservation one month out. She seemed unfazed. I understand a restaurant of this ilk has special events celebrated here all the time, but I was still surprised to not have our special day acknowledged at all until the very end of the meal. Our server (Brian I think?) was wonderful and when he asked what we were in town for we told him we had just eloped and it was our wedding day. The look on his face reflected no knowledge of this. He immediately excused himself from the table and came back with sparkling for us to toast. Well done. As for the food, everything was correctly and artistically prepared and seasoned but not mind blowing. We had risotto, the poached egg, foie gras, tuna, lamb and pork. The stand outs were the lamb, tuna and pork for sure. Again, the food was well done but for the price we expected more. Also note worthy, the sommelier was not exactly polite. When I turned down his offer to help me choose wine (I had already picked our choice for dinner) he had a snide retort. Something about how the list isn't just for looking. I have worked in wine and hospitality for 15 years from New York to Seattle. If I required his help I'm capable of asking. His attitude was off putting. I believe one aspect that sets a higher class fine dining establishment apart from its peers is the experience they provide their customers and the attention to detail. For the dinner of our wedding, I expected more from one of San Francisco's finest.

This review is long overdue. I've been going to Restaurant Gary Danko since they opened. It is the restaurant I use to guage all other dining experiences. First, the room is clean-lined and unpretentious... but still luxurious. Warm neutrals provide a perfect backdrop for the festive florals and glorious food. Steven Lande manages the room and is a dream... the ultimate in professionalism with a great sense of humor. He truly makes you feel at home. The waitstaff is always impeccable - both in dress and manner. They have perfected the concept of attentive without being intrusive. Food and wine magically appears exactly when needed and is timed to perfection. Everything looks effortless - Not an easy task. The menu is truly wonderful. There is something for every palate and you can choose from the various categories (appetizers, fish, meats, desserts) as you like. Are you in the mood for 5 desserts... No Problem! (I've actually done that). But it's criminal to miss the combinations of flavors in the mains. Perfectly cooked meats and vegetables revel in rich, luxurious sauces. There is not a miss on the menu, but favorites are the crab salad, seafood Thai curry and the venison. They also have the single best chocolate souffle in town (and one of the top 3 I've ever had.) If there is ever an ingredient that you have been too unsure to try, this is where you want to do it. All of the preparations are approachable and will give you the best version of what it can be. Then there is the wine list... just describe what you like and give them a free rein. They have shown me stellar pairings I would never have thought of. But if you prefer more control, their expansive list has something for every taste and budget. The experience starts with a wonderful amuse bouche and ends with a plate of assorted mini sweet treats... and every bite in between is flawless. This is definitely NOT an inexpensive restaurant. But the value you find is incomparable. This is why I have the Gary Danko measure for all other restaurants. I am blessed to live in a major foodie city. I have have far more expensive meals that, though wonderful, did not measure up to this experience as a whole. As well, other new and not so new places that were nearly as expensive that did not either. At that price point, they should. This is truly a restaurant in which to experience fine dining. Relaxed, elegant, unpretentious, luxurious. There are not enough superlatives I have for Restaurant Gary Danko.

My wife and I had wanted to go to this restaurant for years but could never get a table. We visit SF on a somewhat regular basis for weekend getaways. This time, we could not get a table but chose to sit at the bar. We were celebrating our 22nd wedding anniversary. They had the full dinner menu at the bar. I had originally planned on getting just one entree and passing on the multiple course dinner. But, there were so many interesting choices that I decided to go with the $87 three course dinner. Boom! Wow! Amazing! Each was better than the previous. The total bill for the two of us was $250 (we had two awesome glasses of wine) before tip. It was worth every penny. If you want a special meal, this is the best choice.

Recently had dinner here with my wife while in San Francisco. We ordered 4 course meals (skipped the cheese portion), a couple of cocktails and two glasses of wine with our main course. The meal was very good, but did not wow us (as you would expect with a $400 dinner tab). Highlights were the glazed oyster and risotto appetizers. Service was prompt and courteous, as you would expect, but a bit stiff. Good experience, but once was probably enough for us.

Price is steep but worth it for what you get. We were here to celebrate a graduation. Booked the private room and everyone had a tasting menu. EVERYONE was more than satisfied with their meal, even the vegetarian. Food beautifully presented and delicious. Service excellent-very knowledgeable & attentive yet not overbearing. We had cocktails at the bar while we waited for the table to be ready (not the fault of the staff but the previous party took their time leaving even though they were aware of a booking after theirs-this often happens in many places) ask the bar tender for his/her recommendation-don't remember what I had but it was WOW!The only negative is if you have knee/leg/hip issues, you have to go up a few stairs to the private room.

Good restaurant, but some remarks
Rating: 4
Date: June 23, 2017
Let me start of by saying I never write reviews about restaurants of this nature (michelin stars etc) because I believe these type of restaurants are always excellent and a review is usually pointless. However, I feel obliged to write this review to point out some small observations. I empasize that the below remarks may be a result of cultural differences, because I am more familiair with European star restaurants and etiquette.We (2p/couple) had the 4 course menu. The food is very nice, the menu divers and unique. The wine menu is very extensive and matches the courses almost flawlessly. The prices are on the low side. Nothing but positive on these aspects.The interior is very balanced and although it is a bit, perhaps American, flashy, it does not feel very crowded or too much. For those familiar with it, it somehow felt like the excellent ninties decor of the Felix in Hong Kong.Concerning the service I do have some observations. Please bear in mind that I hold these type of restaurants to a higher standerd.Firstly, we found it very strange that the staff only asked if they could store our jackets when we were already at our table. It felt a bit uncomfortable to have to 'undress' in the middle of the restaurant. This is especially strange because we were waiting for 5 min at the entrance for our table to be ready: this would have been a more natural moment to take our jackets. From a star restaurant we expect better.What further impacted our experience negatively is the incredible speed the courses followed each other. Within 1 hour we already ate 3 of 4 courses (!). It even went so fast the staff could not keep up. At one point we saw a waiter comming to our table with the main course only to quickly turn around when he saw the dishes of the previous course were still on the table! This was mitigated by two other waiters quickly removing the plates and hastly putting new cutlery on the table. To make things even more clumsly, we could not eat our main course because there was no accompanying wine on the table. After 5 min the sommelier quickly poured us wine without much explanation, for which he appologized beforehand. By this time the main course already lost temperature.After the main course we asked the sommelier to slow down preperation of dessert because we felt being in a fastfood restaurant. The sommelier (who was Australian) told us that the speed also surprised him at first, but that this was apparently how Americans want it. Lastly, what we found a nice touch was the little gesture the restaurant made because of a birthday. In short, because of less optimum service I deduct one point (4/5). However, I would still recommend dinning at this restaurant. Overall we had a nice experience.

We visited Gary Danko on my birthday and were quite disappointed. Service failures occurred even before we arrived with their automated reservation confirmation system. It called me to confirm, leaving a message, and I called back , but was called again the next day by a human. Even after confirming a second time the automated system called again requiring yet another call on my part. When we arrived the managers were apologetic but seated us at an undesirable table by the door. In this location I anticipated we would have people standing behind us waiting to be seated and a draft when the door was opened. For these reasons I asked for a different table but was told I could not be accommodated in anything under an hour. A request for another table has never previously been denied at any of the many fine Bay Area restaurants we have attended. And, as it turned out, this location had other issues. The space between this table and the adjacent one was barely adequate for one person to squeeze through. The consequences of this were that a waiter taking orders from the next table would have his derriere right in my sister's face. Also, if one of our orders came while an order was being taken by the adjacent table the servers would have to wait until the waiter was finished taking the next table's order before serving us. Another drawback of this location was the noise level which precluded conversation at normal voice levels (unlike any of the tables we have had in the room at the back). As for the food the quail I ordered tasted like it had been steamed with the water vapor being more prevalent than the juices of the quail. I was told I could contact Gary Danko myself by email but he had a subordinate reply and unlike other restaurants where mishaps have occurred there was no offer either to compensate us for the poor service or to come back as their guest. For $150 per person I expect better than this and will not choose this restaurant ever again.

This is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco, to be sure, and I always find the service to be of the highest quality. However, on several occasions I have found the food to be very simple preparations of classic dishes, and often in small(er) portions. The execution is absolutely perfect, but for the price tag you sometimes wonder "was it worth it?"

As we were planning our 45th anniversary dinner, there was only one place we considered: Gary Danko. As always, it did not disappoint - indeed, exceeded expectations (again). We were seated promptly at our 5:30 reservation (no waiting for no apparent reason) and proceeded to have a flawless dining experience. The service, the pacing, the food are all without flaw. Both my wife and I opted for the three-course option (prix fixe for 3,4, or 5 courses) - but with three "substantive" course each - no desserts. I started with the rock shrimp risotto; my wife with the fois gras (which she continues to maintain is the best in the world). Both were perfect. I followed with the salmon with horseradish crust, she with the scallops. Both, again, perfectly prepared and displaying a multi-sensory reward. We both opted to follow with the beef tenderloin - and they managed to pull off a "between medium-rare and medium" preparation. We brought a special wine for the celebration (a 35-year old First Growth) and paid a $50 corkage fee - unreasonable, but we knew what it was going in. We were rewarded with a free dessert (complete with candle!) for our anniversary and - once again - left raving about the experience. It's expensive, but is one of the classic, consummate San Francisco dining experiences.

Amazing Service and Good menu!

My husband took me here for my birthday. The place has great ambience. I love how the servers are dressed with suits. I feel like I'm in France. They are well poised and I really loved they way they represent the restaurant with elegance. We chose the 5 course meal and I love the that you can pick twice from any course. We drank cocktails and wine. I love the banana bread that they give you at the end to have at home for breakfast, so delicious, wrapped nicely. I will definitely come back here anytime.The price is so worth it, because of the service, ambience and food. You get what you pay for. Great place.

As a top 10 place in San Francisco it completely satisfied my high level expectations. Waiters were top class - friendly, with right advice, efficient, smiling. Food was fantastic.

We kept thinking about what a good time we had, so we came back as soon as we could. We were happy we did it. We love the menu that's updated constantly, great wine list to choose from, very attentive service, and perfect execution of the dishes. Our favorites were the buffalo steak, the duck, the stuffed quail, and cheeses. It's always crowded, so expect a wait even with a reservation, because they were having a great time and hanging around and chatting after done with their food and desert.

If you go to Gary Danko you can expect perfection from the moment you walk in. I recommend doing the tasting course. The cheese tasting is hard to describe how great it was, just a "you have to be there" kind of experience. The food was just perfect and the dessert just capped it off perfectly. I can honestly say coming from Philadelphia to San Fran this was such a great choice. Tip: make reservations in advance. I booked a month out and it was still tight trying to get a reservation. Ended up going at 9pm. (Still great)

Great place for a special occasion.

We were visiting San Fran for our 10th wedding anniversary and had booked a special dinner out at Gary Danko. It didn't disappoint! The food was divine - prepared perfectly and the flavours amazing. The staff were attentive and knowledgable and the wine list was impressive! But it was the little extras that made the night for us - a complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary and freshly baked goods to take home for our breakfast the next day! I would recommend this place to anyone celebrating a special occasion (and there were lots of people doing that!) for great food and a memorable dining experience.

Gary Danko is THE BEST fine dining option in San Francisco, where the food tastes incredible and the price is a lot cheaper than restaurants of comparable caliber. Their service is also exceptional; all restaurants should aspire to offer services like Gary Danko. They offer great flexibility and customization in their menu: you can choose from 3, 4, or 5 course menus, and you can mix and match the appetizers, entrees, and desserts (e.g., if you chose the 3 course menu, all 3 items can be entrees, if you wish; same goes for the 4 or 5 courses). I love this flexibility and customization so you don't wind up being too full the way you are at Quince (and Quince was nothing special, by the way). Gary Danko offers you the portion size that's right for you!I have loved everything I've tried here, but the oyster with caviar on the appetizer menu is one of my favorites. Their service is as good as it gets. Extremely attentive and friendly staff. Incredibly prompt and fast service. None of that sitting around for 30 minutes before anyone takes your order or having wave down a wait staff to get your bill. In other words, Gary Danko is not short-staffed, and that's the way it should be. ALL restaurants should offer this level of service. Lastly, Gary Dank is quite affordable as far as fine-dining in SF goes: $87 for the 3-course; $104 for the 4 course, and I don't remember the price for the 5 course because I've never gotten so much food. And remember, all courses can be entrees if you wish, to get the most bang for your buck, or if you are super hungry.

Gary Danko is one of San Francisco's 'signature' restaurants and thus I was expecting a spectacular culinary experience. The service was prompt and chilly. Perhaps because we brought our own wine. They obviously don't like that since their wine service has a three-times mark up.The food, which is what it should be all about, was average, just OK. Certainly not memorable. In fact, now that it has been about two months since we visited, I can't even remember what what we ate...and, no I wasn't drunk. This is a classic "all horn and no beef' type of place.Don't waste your money at this place.

Restaurant Gary Danko is the quintessential San Francisco restaurant. We have been visiting this restaurant for many years. It is the perfect place for special occasions or for introducing family and friends to the true experience of high quality restaurant service and food. The service at the restaurant is amazing. The wait staff, servers, sommelier, are all courteous and seamless in their delivery of the service. The food is spectacular. Each time we have eaten there has been a unique and delicious experience. We always recommend the seasonal tasting menu with the wine pairing. The cheese course is also particularly good and always interesting. We always leave Gary Dankos satisfied, amazed, and ready to make our next reservation to come back.

Gary Danko's menu allowed us to create our own prix fixe set meal, and each of us chose three dishes from the selection. My mom and I were the only ones who included dessert: strawberry souffle for Mom and lemon souffle cake for me. The other dishes I chose were the Coconut Thai Curry with Seafood and the Seared Filet of Beef.All the dishes were splendid as we had expected but what blew us away was the impeccable service. Despite our choices not being in the same category, the six of us were always served at the same time and at the same instant. They even prepared a small birthday cake for Mom to blow as well as individually wrapped Pineapple Cake with Cream Cheese to take home.It was a most memorable dinner for all of us. I highly recommend Gary Danko.

I have been going to this restaurant once a year, since it opened approximately 16 years ago. Every time my wife and I, or several other chefs and I go to the restaurant, Gary amazes us with his culinary talent. The potato gnocchi is so light it almost floats up to your mouth. The restaurant sous chefs go to the various markets daily for the freshest and most unique veggies and fruits. The fish is also fresh daily. One day, I was at the SSF Fish Market, and met one of the buyers from the restaurant. We talked about several of the more unusual fishes being sold that morning, and to my delight he purchased about 25 of the fish and were on the menu that night. While this is one of the more expensive restaurants, This resturant sits right next to the French Laundry up in the wine country. Reservations, make them, they book tables up to 6 months in advance. Well worth the wait.One of my table mates ordered a gluten free vegan meal, just to se what they would offer. I was amazed as to the variety and quantity of vegan offerings.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and we started out the night with a solid 5 stars, which decreased to 2 stars, and then went up to 3, thanks to the professionalism of the manager. Tl;dr: They forgot it was my birthday, although we told them THREE TIMES that night alone, along with the reservation. We were extremely excited to come here! We planned it out two months in advance, and since he lives in Vancouver and I go to Stanford, we made a big trip around going to this restaurant. We even planned out our meals down to the last detail!Food-wise, it was delicious! We both ordered the 3-course option. I had the foie gras torchon with country bread, the lobster, and finished with the creme brulee trio (honestly, my favorite). I wasn't a fan of the foie gras--but the lobster and the potato puree were delicious, and the creme brulee was amazing. He had the seafood risotto, pork tenderloin, and chocolate souffle. The tenderloin was kind of chewy, and not very flavorful. But the risotto--OH MY GOD. It's absolutely delicious. I made him switch plates halfway through. The sommelier was kind and unpretentious, and made ordering wine off of their extensive menu a very easy and pleasant experience. The service, on the other hand, exponentially decreased in quality the later the night got. We were sitting with our empty main course plates for FOREVER. The women next to us were seated later, ate all three of their courses, and left before we got our desserts. We received our desserts, and then the server came with our bill and banana bread as soon as we were finished. This would sound normal enough, BUT: we had done extensive research on this place beforehand, and we knew that I was supposed to receive a birthday treat, and we were supposed to receive a tray of petit fours for our table. This did not happen, even though we told the restaurant THREE TIMES it was my birthday, and as this is a place where people go to celebrate special occasions, we were expecting that they would at least be competent enough to remember this. The server did not remember until I looked up at her and said, "It's my birthday?" which she responded with a condescending "Oh, well happy birthday!" until she finally clued in to the ire that was clearly forming on my boyfriend's face.She brought the treat out, but here's the thing: she didn't ask me what I wanted. I saw variations in the treats that had been given, but usually I see a chocolate mousse being served. I can't eat chocolate that is that rich, it makes me sick. For people like me, or for people who have chocolate allergies, I would assume that they have another option. She just gave me the chocolate, of which I could only take a few bites, along with the petit fours and two complimentary glasses of dessert wine.I got up to use the bathroom, and when I came back, I saw my clearly furious partner talking to her quietly. After I sat down, she left, and he told me that the slow service was due to them wanting to give us "space" (space with dirty plates in front of us, apparently), and they just forgot my birthday. Again, three times in one night.The manager is what saved the night, honestly. While we were finishing up our petit fours, he came over and asked us how everything was. He gave us two complimentary glasses of champagne, apologized profusely, and gave me a gift bag with soap, lotion, tea, and a corkscrew. It was so kind and he made me feel happy, even though I had been feeling pretty sad about this whole experience. This was the fanciest restaurant I had ever been to, and I was already feeling out of place and awkward just by being there with my Walmart peacoat and dress I had bought for $20 on Amazon. The slip-ups in service made me feel less valued as a patron than the other people there, and I felt really sad that a night we had planned for so long was turning out so poorly. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal, but this was a nearly $500 dinner, and you would expect little to no mistakes if you're paying that much for it. The manager made me feel comfortable and valued, and I really appreciated that. If this didn't happen, I probably would have gone back to the hotel and cried. But his exceptional care left us walking out of the place hand-in-hand, a bit tipsy with huge smiles on our faces. I really appreciate him and his service, he definitely made my 21st birthday a happy night to remember!

My starter of foie gras was not enhanced by a flabby piece of rhubarb accompanying it. The main course of duck was unremarkable but the Grand Marnier Souffle was really good. Unfortunately we felt rushed throughout the meal and were in and out in one and a half hours. The manual dexterity and speed with which the girl flung the bread onto your side plate whether you wanted it or not had to be seen to be believed. This was definitely the most disappointing meal I have eaten in a restaurant which boasts a Michelin star and calls into question using this standard as a benchmark when choosing a restaurant. Do not book this restaurant if you wish to have a leisurely meal as they obviously run a very slick operation and it is evident they want you in and out so they can re-lay the table for the next diners.

Had eaten here several years ago and we were looking forward to being able to eat here again. Ate at the bar as we enjoy a bit of interaction with bar staff. Food again was excellent but felt over priced especially being Australian and having to add 5% staff healthcare then 20% tip and then add 33% to all that back into Australian dollars. Wine prices quite high $60 a bottle starting point. Very impressive wine list and prices obviously reflect carrying thousands of dollars of stock in the cellars. Very pleasant service totally un rushed. Bison was excellent and had to try as don't get in Australia.Probably not on our must do list if we were in San Fran again mainly due to cost.

A late dinner that wasn't necessary after flying 28 hours (including transit in Vancouver) but I can't imagine coming to San Francisco without dinner at Gary Danko - been doing it for more than 20 years.It hasn't changed a lot, not cutting edge and innovative like Saison, Crenn or Coi but the quality is superb both in produce and taste. Perhaps it is nostalgia dining but I still love it.At 10 at night, stuck to 3 (rather than the indulgence of 4) courses for some $89 and each course was perfection, a wonderful Maine lobster followed by a lemon pepper duck breast and an old favourite, Grand Marnier souffle.Meets all needs and wonderful for a celebration, many of my neighbouring tables were celebrating birthdays.
