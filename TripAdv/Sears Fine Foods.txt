We ate here because it was close to the hotel. The first time was for dinner and it was wonderful. Crab cakes with an arugula salad and a blue fondue with roasted garlic and cranberry/blueberry chutney starter...all washed down with a more than acceptable chardonnay. The server's recommendations were spot on and we're glad we took her advice.The second meal was for breakfast the day we were leaving. It was okay, but we'd already concluded San Francisco doesn't do breakfast well. My broiled grapefruit was acceptable, although not sectioned and a bit hard to eat without getting sticky. My husband had eggs over-medium which arrived over-easy. Not bad enough to complain, but disappointing. That being said, service was great both times.Good place for an evening meal, not so great for first thing in the morning.

We were looking for a late lunch on Friday afternoon and haphazardly chose Sear's Fine Foods. What a lucky accident. Service was a little slow, but we were so satisfied with the quality of the meal that we didn't care. We split a Caesar, a Hamburger and Fries and all were top notch and delicious. My only regret was that we weren't in town long enough to return. Next time we're in SF, we'll definitely be back.

"World Famous Swedish Pancakes"

Date: October 14, 2017
We had been told by several friends that this was a must visit. Coincidently, it was right beside our hotel so made for a convenient Saturday morning breakfast. A very popular place as the waiting line was out on the sidewalk but did move quickly. Once in, it was a go back in time kind of place. We took two seats at the counter instead of a table and had great service. When something on the menu is listed as "world famous", you just have to order it right, and yes the Swedish pancakes with 100% maple syrup were great. Eggs Florentine also delicious (poached to perfection), bacon amazing (really) and fresh fruit topped off the meal. A great memu of breakfast favorites provided tough decisions and very glad we listened to our friends and visited.

I recently visited Sears twice for dinner, the first time I had their Saturday night special of Prawn Linguine which was lovely, plentiful, subtle taste & enough prawns to keep me happy! I went back the following Saturday night and had the Slow Roasted Prime Rib. This is one of the dearer items on the menu and I expected good things but unfortunately it was not to be. The beef was overcooked, tough & very fatty. We complained to our indifferent server who took 20% of our bill but really didn't seem to care less. On the plus side, the accompanying creamed spinach was excellent and the baked potato perfectly fine. The horse raddish which is mentioned in the menu description of the meal, was missing and when we asked for this the bottle was just plonked down of the table in front of us, not very classy at all!So, one meal was great and one meal wasn't, a third visit will be needed when I am lucky enough to return one day to the beautiful City by the Bay

A short wait outside brings you into a very crowded restaurant. The 18 Swedish pancakes are what they are famous for and were good. I didn't feel like there was anything particularly special about them though. My companions enjoyed their food as well (pecan waffle and short stack with chicken sausage). Service was good and prompt, but nothing to write home about.You're definitely paying for the history and experience here.

The grilled grapefruit is a perfect start. The eggs are great amazing middle, and the Swedish World Famous Pancakes are a delicious end! This order is more than plenty to share (18 full order or 9 half order).... Only order a half order is you are getting other items! To top it all off the delectable coffee superb in a tall glass! YUM!!!! Would return in a heartbeat! Until Next time SEARS!!!!!!

Calling Sears a diner is like equating hand-made Belgian truffles with M&M's.This is all-American fare (e.g. a different Blue Plate Special for every day of the week, like meatloaf on Mondays), but upscale (e.g. the warm apple tart was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream and a lovely caramel rum sauce) as well as classic (the chocolate mousse cake was drizzled with both raspberry and chocolate sauces).The restaurant was understandably busy, but the service wasn't unreasonably slow. We would definitely return.

The bill was just shy of $50 for two people, and you are treated like cattle in and out as fast as they can so they can get those queuing in the street at a table. needless to say we didn't go back again and won't recommend to friends

. . . and ours is that this is a pretty swell place. With both visits we had no experiences like those who have posted negatives. Service: swift and cordial. Atmosphere: amusing items on the walls, old-time honeycomb tile floor and lovely old light fixtures. Location: right near our hotel just a half block up from Union Square. We came for lunches and there were no lines (these seem to be the norm first thing in the morning). The food isn't "creative cuisine" but, rather, straightforward, almost diner-like. Eggs florentine, macaroni and cheese, California club sandwich and ham and cheese omelet were all just right. The token provided for use at the slot machine (for a chance to win a free meal) is a charming touch. We were losers but the place is a winner in our book.

Sears was recommended to us by our tour company as a good spot to have an early breakfast before a full day of touring. It was comforting to see that many of San Franciscos finest (police officers) choose to dine here as we encountered tables full of them on both occasions that we dined here. Our first breakfast experience here, saw us seated by a maitre de that seemed bored beyond belief. However thankfully our server was prompt and helpful. The breakfast menu was extensive, and our meals arrived quickly and were as expected. Our second visit, was a better experience and in general we have no complaints and would definitely dine here again. Having said that we had an early breakfast on both occasions so no queue for seating. Lines can be long from mid morning onwards.

My waiter was cheerful and very kind.The following Monday, I returned to the restaurant around 6:00 PM. The restaurant was not so busy at this hour. I ordered the boneless short rib. My order came out within a reasonable good amount of time. I love the presentation of my short rib, it looked liked a work of art. After my dinner, I had a nice chat with my waiter. My waitress went on her break, she was very friendly and courteous. If I am in San Francisco, I would return to Sears Fine Food for dinner.

I read some of the negative reviews and it is clear their expectations don't match what sears delivers.It is a coffee shop. You don't go for the decor or the refined service. At breakfast you go there or eggs, omelettes and pancakes cooked any way you want them. Their crispy hash browns are the best in town and if you want egg whites, fruit instead of hash browns or any other variation it is no problem,.It is busy especially in the morning and because there is a line they don't want you lingering like you would in a hotel dining room.I think it is terrific but if you expect anything other than a coffee shop with terrific food don't go.

We were impressed with both meals, especially the Crab Chowder, the Apple Cranberry Salad, Pancakes with Lingonberry Jam, and breakfast in general. A nice affordable option in a great, but expensive city. The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. This is a nice place to eat.

We waited in line for just a few minutes. The portions are large and can easily be shared. The waffle was light with crispy edges and had whipped cream piled high. No complaints, good food, hot, big portions and good service.

Ok, here it is. Ordered the Fish & Chips, Dungeness Crab Chowder and had the Coconut Pecan Bread Pudding. The Fish and Chips were good, but not anything special. The Chowder...OMG!!! Some of the best I've ever had! And the Bread Pudding was fresh and very tasty! Waitress was friendly and spot on with delivery and refills.

Great breakfast, large portions & quick friendly service. Cool old tome decor! Corn beef hash, pancakes and thick cut bacon or omelets, all were very good. Can't go wrong at Sears!

Fine Foods?

Sears Fine Foods is a diner! The breakfast was your typical diner food...eggs, pancakes, French toast, etc. The only thing that represented fine dining was the price tag! My husband and I both had coffee, he an omelet and I had eggs benedict. $50 price tag with tip. Not worth the price.

Good dinner

I read a lot of reviews about the breakfast here but decided to try the dinner instead. The service is very good and friendly. The food was great - I had the sourdough bread starter, followed by the boneless short ribs. Everything was just right. My only complaint is that I would have loved more meat on my plate. It seemed a little less than I was expecting. However, it was a reasonable serving size. Worth a look if you're around.

Food is good but be prepared to wait. Sitting at the bar allows faster service and some interaction with the waiter. Other wait staff is too busy to talk to customers.

Awesome breakfast and fast, friendly service

We were a little nervous when we saw the long line outside but it moved quickly and the food was delicious. We had the 18 pancakes and they were very good. The service was quick but not rushed. The staff was very friendly and the coffee never went dry.

Really good food.

Went here for dinner. Food was really good, three steaks and a burger. Nice atmosphere, would have been a five if the waiter had been a bit happier!

We had to wait a bit to get a table on a Saturday morning, but it was worth it. The Swedish pancakes were delicious and enough for two to share. The wait staff is attentive and hard working. Great coffee and fresh juice. A lovely way to start the day.

Food is fair.
