We had breakfast here on our last day in San Francisco ,it was very good.They focus a lot on eggs but you can make up your breakfast with whatever is on the menu .There was a good selection ,you can eat outside (undercover) or inside,the staff were only to happy to accommodate you. It was very busy at the time we were there which shows how good it is.You can also get lunch ,there was a good selection on the menu.Like other places we ate at it is only a few minutes away from the Fishermans Wharf area ,its worth making the effort.There was three of us and we all liked the food here.

This place is easy to miss, I walked past it the first time, but there is a sign at the end of the road.There are tables and chairs to sit outside and the staff will come and give you a menu (you can also sit inside)I only had a sausage butty here, but it was nice, although the sausages are thinner than ones I have in England, maybe it's just a local thing? You can get local and Asian food in this place, so they seem to cater for a lot.If you need to use the toilet in this place, ask the staff first, they are hidden at the back past the kitchen.

You're at the Wharf, it's Sunday morning at 11 and not an easy time to find an open table anywhere (especially during Fleet Week) but I stumbled on to this place and was immediately helped by a waiter to an empty table. Yes, there is Pho and other Vietnamese specialties but I challenge anybody to treat an egg better than these guys. My "over medium" eggs were perfect as were the cottage potatoes. Excellent service, even in the mist of jammed restaurant and street seating. The waiter even offered to put me at a better table after it cleared. I also like that the kitchen is part of the dining room which adds to the energy. I'll go back.

We only stayed a couple of days in SF but this was definitely a firm favourite.

Good pho located in a touristy area

Most touristy restaurants everywhere one goes, the food is usually not good in quality or quantity. But at Darren's Cafe, the pho is authentic and delicious. Run family style, one can tell they take pride in their product. There are many other items on the menu, but as far as judging a Vietnamese restaurant, the pho is to be judged, If the pho is good, the rest of the menu will be good. And at Darren's Cafe, the pho is good. Large bowl of beef pho...$11.50....not a bad price for a touristy area. Open only for lunch!

Operating on the theory that it's difficult to screw up breakfast, our experience for breakfast was OK. The food was fine and the service adequate. Prices are as low as you will find on Fisherman's Wharf. A small place. The tables are crammed in and itfeels like you are sitting in the kitchen. Very noisy with the hustling kitchen staff and clattering of dishes.

We went here for breakfast one morning. We were looking for an affordable option for breakfast for a family of four in the Fisherman's Wharf area. This place was a much better option than the chain places. Everything we ordered was delicious. We tried an omelette, which was huge and came with a unique thin tasty hash brown. We also tried a burger, BLT and the chicken viatnemese sandwich. It's nice that they have several Vietnamese options in addition to traditional American dishes. There are not many affordable options in the touristy fisherman's wharf area, but this one is a solid choice!

We were headed to the Jack in the box to grab a fast breakfast before we jumped on our tour bus. We passed this place on the way and we are glad we did. It was nice to not have to eat fast food. This place immediately sat us. Our food came out fast. The breakfasts that my family tried were the country fried steak and eggs which was good. The eggs were cooked perfect. My son got the french toast combo. He liked that. I got the pancakes. Those were good too. Friendly and fast service. Looks like you can get a mix of American or Vietnamese style food which I was kind of hesitant. But they executed American food perfectly. I rated it as Average as it is not the best breakfast I had but it was good. Don't hesitate to come here.

We were wandering around after having just arrived in San Francisco and decided to have breakfast here. I was a bit reluctant at first because the place looked very small but the breakfast menu looked good so wet decided to give it a try. We were seated and waited on immediately. Within what felt like 2-3 minutes, our food was on our table. Quickest turnaround time ever! Food was excellent too, we tried the fried egg sandwich on a bagel, eggs with toast and potatoes, and the 3 cheese omelet and all were great.

The only bad thing I can say about Darrens is they close too early and wish they served dinner. Clean and casual. We found this spot for lunch on day 3 of our 5 day trip to the Warf. We missed the 4th day because we taught they were open til 4. Then visited again on the 5th with that being said we were sorry we did not eat here every day. Also only had lunch not breakfast. Well worth the visit. KEEP IT UP DARREN'S

So wish I had found this place Years ago. On a recent trip with my son we spotted this place and on our last day popped in for breakfast. What a treat. Service was fast and the food was at the table in under 5 minutes.I had sausage and eggs with home potatoes. Very good.My son had eggs benny and he says may be the best he's had.He would know as when we go out for breakfast that is usually his go to meal. It had tables outside but we dined inside.Staff was courteous and very attentive. This meal was probably almost $16 cheaper than Denny's was down the street.Plus I prefer mom and pop places over big chain places.My 2cts,I hope this helps.

So, looking for breakfast- son, his 12-yr old son and me. Needed to be fairly quick because we were catching a tour bus. At a stop light we're discussing and a woman passes us and said... Darren's just ahead... She turned out to be our server. All young men and women staff. Sooooo efficient. Immediately at your table whoever was close by with question as to drinks and giving us a menu. Then after drinks and ordering, the line cooks made breakfast...no matter how many people were there (very small place, a few tables outside). Excellent. The best potatoes. The boy had pancakes, twice, French toast once, egg/bacon/cheese sandwich. Every egg was perfect, My son said he was gonna have the toast just because it was sour dough and again perfect. We wound up going all 4 days we were there. Why change. Reasonable for the Wharf area and again.....just delightful, friendly staff. Would have loved to had lunch, or tried the Pho, Only open breakfast and lunch.

I consult TripAdvisor every time I travel to select accommodations and for eating, even for picking a place for my morning coffee. Having just debarked the Powell-Mason cable car at Fisherman's Wharf, I consulted my TripAdvisor app for breakfast spots nearby, by ranking. Darren's Cafe appeared close to the top, but not at the top. I think that it deserves a higher ranking, based on my experience.I walked around the area for a little bit before picking Darren's for my Sunday morning breakfast in San Francisco by Fisherman's Wharf. Having scoped out the top 4 or 5 places in the ranking, I finally decided on Darren's Cafe. It was busy on a Sunday morning, around 8:30 am as I expected it would be, but I didn't have to wait for a table. I was greeted at the door by a very friendly teenage girl, who directed me to an open table. Immediately, a server was at my table to help me settle in and get a coffee to me right away. I love breakfast food and I'm always happy with a greasy-spoon bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. However, when I travel I prefer to order something on the menu that wouldn't be available back home or many other places. Their breakfast menu was varied with a lot of standard breakfast options, but they also had a nice selection of local specialties.Initially, I wanted the Dungeness Crab omelette, however it wasn't available due to the crabs not being in season. Not to worry, I was also eyeing their Combination Omelette. Think of any ingredient from any of your favourite omelettes and put them all in one. Tomatoes, Ham, Sausage, Mushroom, Onion, Peppers, American and Swiss cheese. The omelette came quickly to my table, only 5 minutes or so. The side of potatoes was generous and delicious. The omelette was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh and delicious. I especially loved the sausage, the pieces were a good bite size and they were seasoned with fresh herbs and spices. Not your typical breakfast sausage. The omelette itself had fresh seasonings to add to the flavour.Definitely 5 star quality food for budget-minded cost.My table was situated right next to the food preparation area, where you can see the cooks making all the orders in plain sight behind a glass separation. The whole time that I was there, I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently the cook staff worked. It is no wonder my food arrived so quickly. The restaurant was very busy, yet people were coming in and out as they were seated, ordered, ate and left with a fast, but not rushed pace. I certainly took my time eating and savouring my coffee refill before deciding that I was ready to leave. When I was, the bill was promptly brought to my table and I was able to pay and be on my way. When I left, there was a waiting list, but it never seemed to get more than two parties long and they were being seated after a 5 or less than 10 minute wait.The Combination Omelette tasted great, but even better was the amazing flavour of the freshly-squeezed Orange Juice. I couldn't tell if they made it on-site or if a supplier provides it. However, that didn't matter to me as drinking the Orange Juice tasted fresh and sweet as biting into a real orange. I'm still rating my experience 5 stars across the board, however there is one thing that they could improve on. The American and Swiss cheese were processed cheese slices melted on top of the omelette. Although I have to admit the taste was fine with everything else, it would be much better if freshly shredded cheeses were used instead of the processed versions.

Okay food, but I wouldn't go out of my way

Traveling to SF many times, I've always seen Darren's Cafe but never tried them. I recently did. Overall, the breakfast is okay. I had a bacon omelette with hash browns and sourdough toast. The omelette was good, but nothing to write home about. I did like the fact that the hash browns didn't have a "salt" taste. In fact they were a bit bland, but that was okay because I could season accordingly. The so called sourdough toast was nothing more than white bread. The lack of service was the biggest disappointment next to passing off white bread as sourdough. Would I go back? If there were no other options, probably, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way.

We ate here before we biked the Golden Gate. It was really quick and the food was hot. We had eggs and pancakes. We enjoyed pretty much everything so if you're looking for a good quick breakfast I would recommend it. One thing that was different was it served Asian food at the same time so the combined smells was a little off-putting for me as I ate my breakfast, but it wasn't too big of a deal. Give it a try!

Definitely filled a gap!

We stayed nearby at the holiday inn and ate here 3 times for breakfast.Service was excellent, they are all so polite and friendly. We never waited long for our food which was really nice and cheaper than lots of other places nearby. Lovely family run cafe.

Had our second breakfast of our three days there. We'd walked round quite a bit looking for somewhere close to our hotel and settled on Darren's. Perhaps it's because we're from England but French bread with icing sugar on with eggs and too crisp bacon left me feeling slightly yucky. The service was quick and good and the coffee alright. I felt that compared to UK prices it did not give good value.

A well run family place with great food...we need more of these places

Stumbled on this small cafe/ resturant whilst looking for breakfast, San Fran was packed and this place was busy but looked well run and calm.. Seated for breakfast we were greeted with very attentive staff and despite the place being packed they really look after you. It's a big menu and we had classic American breakfasts, bacon,hash browns, eggs,French toast and pancakes....all really good. Looking at the menu they also do some great Vietnamese food and some of the locals were tucking into hot bowls of Pho. I love places like this, no chain, family run and good honest food at good prices. If you are in the area check them out.

Perfect breakfast location.

We were in the city for 3 days, and this was by far the best breakfast we had during our short stay, the service was superb, the employees worked extremely hard and this showed, the food was extremely nice, eggs were perfectly cooked, which can't be said for some of the other breakfast locations we went to during our stay. The best bit of this cafe is the price, the value for money was exceptional. This was the best tasting breakfast during our stay and the considerable cheapest. I would highly recommend.

This place was awesome!

We had our first meal there and wanted to eat breakfast there but it did not work out in our plans. We had the fried rice & chicken. It was excellent, made fresh right in front of us. We got two meals and split between to adults and an average 11 almost 12 year old. The service was quick & friendly. The breakfast dishes looked wonderful, served all day! The price was very reasonable,

Good breakfast and pretty quick service. Hashbrowns were pretty close to the Waffle House and the eggs were cooked to perfection. Nothing wrong with this hidden gem !!!

Expect to not wait for your good food

I visited here for a quick breakfast and some Vietnamese food. I ordered and was promptly served 5 minutes later! Wow. I brought back my dad later because the service was so good and they remembered me and gave me a free fruit plate despite me not ordering anything. If you want excellent service with a smile and pretty good food then stop in here. Fish wharf is a really busy area and there are lots of people, so having a breakfast place that serves your eggs or anything else in under 5 minutes is really important and really respected by me. Thank you Darren's for making my visit to SF just that much better. 

Great Breakfast

We loved this restaurant for breakfast which was a stones throw from our hotel. Huge selection, you could any item on the menu not just from the breakfast choices. Fabulous service, the meals arrived quickly. Clean and great staff. 

Great breakfast!

We were looking for somewhere relatively inexpensive near to our hotel in Fisherman's Wharf and we stumbled across this.We had a stack of pancakes with fruit and a stack of French toast. Both huge portions that kept us going all day. Staff were friendly and attentive and the food couldn't be argued with. A good alternative to iHop.

Darren's has good American an Vietnam Breakfast (Soups, Rice, Noodles...). Cafe refill is quick - very important! ;-)

Excellent Pho

Best part of this restaurant besides the excellent service is the fact that they serve delicious breakfasts as well as authentic Pho. They have omelettes, variations of eggs benedict and pancakes. You know it's a good place when the tour guides eat there.

Great Cafe!

We stumbled upon Darren's by accident and I'm so glad that we did ... what a great place! Nothing fancy but it's clean, service was prompt, food was very, very good and reasonable. I'm sorry that we didn't discover it sooner on our trip - we would have been a regular. My cheese omelet was perfect, as were the hash browns and the one thing that I must commend them on - their coffee - it's great!

Vermicelli Noodles are yummy!

We were seated as soon as we came in. It was pretty busy when we got there, but the service was amazing for a small restaurant. So attentive from the whole staff. I had a omelette ham, cheese and mushrooms....fantastic.

Darren's was great for my family. My husband could get a typical American breakfast while I got Vietnamese chicken with rice. I know it sounds weird but it really works. You'll pay about $5 an entree less at Darren's than you will at the much hyped Hollywood Cafe. The service is amazingly quick and attentive. That is not something we got everywhere. We ate here twice and it was great and fast both times. Wish there was a Darren's in my town. My husband said it was the most satisfying breakfast he had the whole trip. Simple but well prepared and a good value comparatively. The only downside is going through the kitchen to get to a bathroom that I think is communally shared by the building. It was kind of weird. But outside of that, I would go back to Darren's for sure. 

Excellent little cafe

Found this place when avoiding the crowds on Sunday, had lunch and it was delicious. Great selection of American and Vietnamese food. Great value and friendly staff. The noodle soups seemed to be very popular and did taste delicious.

Good for takeout, terrible for dine-in

Credit/Debit card was down - thankfully we had cash, but I saw them send a patron across the street to an ATM for cash. Unaware of the time they closed, we were rushed by 2 different people thru our meal. I had been there the day before for a to-go order & service was fine. Food is just "ok".

Great find

We were looking for all day breakfast, we found it. Great food, great service! My daughter got a cheeseburger while we got breakfast. She said it was amazing.
