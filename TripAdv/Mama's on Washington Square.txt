Thee Best Omelette Ever!

The 'Farmers Omelette' is definitely hands down thee best tasting Omelette I have ever had! I wasn't sure about the leeks at first but they added a whole new delicious flavour to the dish it was life-changing! I would highly recommend this place. The wait time outside and inside is worth it for the large portions and hearty dishes served by friendly staff.

Get here early! We got here around 10:30 and was finally seated at 12:15 but it was worth it! My husband had the Norwegian Benedict and said it was good (he's very picking about his benedict). I got the Californian omelet and it was light and fluffy with a lot of fillings. The chocolate cinnamon French toast looked yummy. The staff was very friendly and it was pretty quick service.

Awesome food &amp; great service

They have their own ways here you just have to go with it.... waited a short time to be allowed in, ordered food at the counter and then advised where to sit. Lovely area and watching all the locals stretching in the square opposite kept us amused while waiting. Food was fabulous as per the other reviews and they are happy to box up any leftovers which many people had due to the portion sizes, I really think you could probably share one dish with a side. Coffee and water refilled by attentive friendly staff. A must try.

Saw a queue outside and just knew it would be worth the wait. One of the brothers talked to the patrons queuing outside and offered cups of water as it was an exceptionally hot day.Food was delicious. The omelette was huge, I would say six eggs were used. I couldn't eat it all so I boxed up half my breakfast and gave it away to a young homeless woman in the nearby square.

This place reminds me of some of the cafes for locals in London... busy, great vibe, but they want you in and out. The boss is the boss... questioning why people are coming in via the "wrong" entrance and you must place your order at the counter before they provide a seat... of which they are extremely limited.That said, it's all part of the experience and the food was great! $15 will get you a good sized breakfast and a coffee.

We chose to walk to Mama's from our hotel in Fisherman's Wharf for breakfast just to soak in the SF architectures and unique hilly streets. We were quite hungry by the time we get to Mama's and it's already brunch/early lunch time. Quite a few locals dine here, which is always a good sign. Seats were soon available after we ordered from the counter. The crab cake Benedict's and French roast with cranberry sauce were both freshly made and comfortingly delicious. Beware of the portion size. We should have stuck to the original plan and share one plate between us but it would be too difficult to pick one from the big menu because they all look good and sure to be someone's favourite.

We arrived at about 10am on a Friday morning and there was already quite a queue for brunch. The wait is between 30-40 mins long. So, if you're in a group, get in the queue and grab a coffee from the nearby cafes. We ordered chocolate French toast and crab cake Benedict and a glass of fresh orange juice. All were really good, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the crab cakes were tasty. The French toast was also good as it had berries, bananas & chocolate. Service was fast and friendly. Worth the wait.

As this is supposed to be a SF institution we prepared ourselves for a queue during our recent trip - we waited outside for maybe 20-25mins then you go inside and wait to order at the register so maybe another 10 there- you are then seated and the food arrived promptly, it was delicious! I got the French toast with seasonal fruit, my boyfriend got the classic benedict and we got smoothies, all were really good, but the French toast was just unbelievably good, worth the queueing!

My friend and I were looking for someplace to get a decent breakfast during our trip, and Mama's was recommended to us by several apps. The line can get very long, but it's because due to how the restaurant is run. Instead of putting in your name and waiting for a table, you wait in line to put your food order in. If there's no table available for you, they'll wait before allowing you to place your order. So to the people saying the service was bad, it's just their procedure, and it's a small place with limited seating, so of course you're going to wait. Also, the line is outside in San Francisco, it's not like New England where if the line is out the door, you're freezing or dying from the humidity, so let's not be so critical. The line moved pretty quickly while we were there, we waited maybe a half hour, and I thought the food was quite good. My order was very simple, but some of the choices looked pretty great. I would return, but I would also be interested in trying so many of the other breakfast places nearby.

My kids and I were on a last minute trip to San Francisco and decided to try this place out. Thought it must be awesome since there was always a line and such great reviews. We waited 1.5 hours Sunday in the heat. Arrived at 9 am prepared to wait. My kids are 12, 14 and 16 and we travel lots ( 7 weeks this summer total) and we love to try new places. My kids are not picky. This is my first trip advisor review. for the life of me cannot think of any reason why people have loved this place so much. All tourists in line. The place is tiny and nothing special. Just a regular diner. The service was sloooooweeeww. The guy taking our Order kept complaining to us how hot he was. My kids ordered pancakes as told me IHOP was better. My 16 year old order the south of the border omelette and that pretty good. I got the crab omelette which was good. Had lots of crab. Overall we all decided eating breakfast at our hotel was just as good. If there was no line I think we would never have noticed this place.Not worth the wait!

Mama's seemed to be very well recommended online and in travel guides so we made it a must visit breakfast venue! We arrived on Friday morning at 9am and there was already a queue which we were expecting. People in the queue were locals as well as tourists which showed its good reputation. We waited for an hour to get in but it was worth it. The menu has plenty to choose from and caters for sweet and savoury preferences. I had the French toast sampler which was delicious and I would definitely order again. There are so many cakes and pastries which are also very tempting! Breakfast for 2 cost us around $40 which is more than reasonable and it's close to Coit Tower so you can walk some of your breakfast off. Mama's is the perfect breakfast/brunch place in SF!

We queue'd for about an hour for a midweek breakfast, and it was worth the wait: this is really saying something because who in their right minds would seriously line up for an hour for 'just' breakfast? Seriously, this is/was fantastic food and a really nice holiday/local atmosphere. If we were in San Fransisco again I imagine we'd aim to get there earlier than we did (e.g. aim for 8:30am instead of 9:30am, which I think is when we showed up). Perhaps the queue is less earlier on? (could be wrong, though)

It is classic comfort food for breakfast. The service was also very friendly. A great way to start the day.

My husband does not liking queuing so when we saw the queue at Mama's despite it being 9am on a Thursday i was worried he was going to make us give up and try somewhere else. But thank goodness he didn't! The queue lasted about an hour, the guy on the door happily chatted to us about menu options when we were near the front. Its a family business so his brother was taking orders and makes the famous jam they use in their Monte Cristo sandwich. I had the bacon eggs florentine and my husband had the daily special of the breakfast sandwich. Both came quickly after ordering and were delicious! The portion size is big though, be prepared to be very full. The french toast and pancakes looked insane but we had no room left for those too.Definately worth the wait!

If you aren't patient, find another place to eat. They only seat 37 people I believe. The wait is at least an hour, maybe more. The concept is wonderful. The menu is on the outside of the restaurant. Once you enter, you are directed to a line that faces a glass enclosed area where 3 large menus are posted and the chefs are cooking. Once you work your way down the short line, you place your order with the cashier, pay and take your seat. Once you finish, leave your tip and you're gone. No waiting for a check. Saves a lot of time. I am not an egg eater but the omelettes and french toast looked wonderful. When it said "fluffy" pancakes, it meant just that. The pancakes were fluffy, the bacon, potatoes and coffee were delicious. Can't wait to return. They also serve lunch.

I had heard about Mama's from a review in an inflight magazine. We had to go for it!Usually I take a few images of the meal as a reminder but on this occasion, we were too hungry after waiting in queue close to an hour for a table. Vince the co-owner was very friendly and met all the visitors waiting outside to share a conversation, take a photo in the doorway and or give some insight into their style of cooking and sourcing. We got to eating at close to 11:45am whilst the queue outside was ever growing. The meal is very flavorful, balanced in acidity, tanginess and the spices are complimentary. My wife had the poached eggs with salmon, I had the breakfast scramble with chorizo and the kids had pancakes and or scrambled eggs. Two Thumbs Up!

We are native San Franciscans and usually avoid the touristy restaurants. We arrived at 11:30 and the line was long. TWO hours long. I haven't eaten here in almost 10 years and expected some good food. As I said, TWO hour wait and the place was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The waitress said their were a lot of larger parties, thus the long wait. The Monte Cristo was Luke warm. One of the most expensive dishes, the crab Benedict had hard boiled poached eggs! The wait staff was attentive. As for the kitchen, they need to brush up on how to prepare food. There were small flies landing on the freshly baked goods and one of the cooks dropped some blueberries and proceeded to pick it up and throw it back in with the "non contaminated" ones. A lot of hype for a long wait, high priced, SF breakfast joint. SF has many more superior breakfast spots to choose from, no reason to go here or come back.

The best and always worth the wait. Got there at 7 am on a Saturday and was first in line. Mike Sanchez, the owner, invited me inside to sit and then we had a great conversation. He said his favorite are the pancakes because of the recipe he uses and I agree completely. Also had the omelette and enjoyed it too. When I lived in the area, I never got up early enough to go there expect when I had family in town. This time, we were visiting and staid across the street in a B&B, but passed up their breakfast for Mamas and so glad we did.Get there early!! Be prepared to wait, but it is worth it.

We waited an hour or so for this lovely little place. I have to say I've been fortunate to have some amazing breakfasts across America. If you're looking for something convenient to the downtown area of SFC though, I think you'll struggle to beat this place. I ordered teh crab cakes benedict which was phenomenal to say the lease. My partner order the generously portioned Crab Omelette which was also very good but lacked a certain something. We also ordered the french toast sampler (another main) which came with four small pieces of french toast roughly laid together. All in we paid over $75!All of the mains were obviously around $25, which is a lot for breakfast but its pretty good breakfast. There are cheaper offering available for around $15.My only complaint was the 'home fries' aka fried potatoes. They were almost entirely raw on the inside. I did point this out and a fresh set of even more raw potatoes arrived 20 minutes later which was a real shame. I was told they had switched to 'red potatoes' so perhaps this was the issue. No compensation was offered. The service is good and the location is lovely.I'd still go back, but there are other more worthy 'best breakfast in SFC' options but a good 20-30 minute cab ride away

This might be the best breakfast place I've ever been to. They have 20 different dessert breads that they batter and French-toast-ify for you.

As a fan of big American breakfasts this was certainly worth the wait. It helps to get there early but if you are in a group and there before 9am, you can break up the wait and take turns to visit the impressive St Peter and Paul Church - before the morning service starts - around the corner in Washington Square. Once inside you need to join a second queue to order your food at the counter - but don't forget to tip your server! The breakfasts also nicely set you up for the hike to the nearby Coit Tower!

First this is worth the wait. We arrived around 9. We waited in line outside a little over an hour. You go in the door order and then are seated and the food is brought out.

If you could go to one spot add this to your list.

There is a permanent queue outside this small restaurant but don't be put off by this as it is well worth the wait. We queued for around half an hour to 45 mins but this was one of our favourite restaurants in SF. Once inside you order your food at the counter and are then shown to your table and the food is served to your table. The system is great and works very well. I had corned beef hash with poached eggs and sauteed potatoes with toast, it was absolutely delicious. The staff were very attentive even though it is a very busy place. Would definitely queue and return here, loved the whole experience.Would be even better if there was any way the restaurant could put up a canopy to shade the queuing customers.The restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch and is not open in the evenings.

Don't believe the other reviews that tell you that Mamas is not worth the 45 minute wait. It absolutely is! My family and I had a life changing breakfast. My kids shared the cinnamon chocolate French toast which was absolutely delicious. My husband had the Washington square omelet, which he didn't let me try... but he ate the whole thing so he definitely loved it. I had the Spanish Benedict which was made with chorizo and is the best eggs Benedict I ever had (scratch that statement from the Cafe de la Presse review, this one trumped it). It was all amazing. The people were all super nice. Just wait! Even if you think about leaving, don't... it's totally worth every bite!

A big yay overall even though my food experience wasn't so good. I believe we got there at 8:30 am and we had about 1.5 hr wait. If you're up for it like I was, no biggy. If you have a grouchy counterpart then not so much. Even so, I think in the end we both loved it but would only go again if we were up super early to get there 30 minutes before opening.Once we got inside, I loved seeing the kitchen and ALL THE BAKED GOODS as we waited to order. I couldn't resist adding a blueberry crumb cake to our order, which was really good. The inside is so homey and cute and we had really good service and a nice table. But then it happened...... I was SET on having the monte cristo. I could NOT WAIT. Sadly, after I took a bite it just didn't taste so good to me. Very eggy (they do it like french toast rather than deep fry it) and I just didn't like it. Half way through I discovered there was mayonaisse in it. I HATE mayo so much that I don't even care that I spelled it wrong just then. Wish they had listed that on the menu. I can't be the only one. Also, it barely had any meat in it. All I tasted was eggy bread and mayo (but the jam was delicious). Well, even though I was traumatized I was filled up by then so no biggy. Pretty sure my husband enjoyed his food, which I believe was an omelette.In spite of it all, I agree with everyone that you just have to go here. It just has such a sweet vibe and you'll be nice and hungry by the time you get in and you will have hot coffee and (hopefully) yummy food and a cozy atmosphere to enjoy. Glad we went.

If you're visiting San Francisco, this place is a must visit for breakfast. We arrived 15min before opening on a weekday and had to wait about 30min after opening to get a seat. Be prepared to order once you walk into the restaurant as you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you. We ordered an omelette, Eggs Benedict, and split a french toast dish. The food was tasty, but it was a a bit expensive for what it was. Nonetheless, if you have the opportunity, I recommend trying this place at least once. Note that on weekend mornings, the wait can exceed an hour.

We were in SF for a family holiday from the UK & visited the Coit Tower near the end of our stay. On the bus up to the Tower, Washington Square looked good so we made sure after our visit we stopped in the Square on the way back down. It was late morning by the time we got back to the Square & the lines which were probably outside Mama's earlier had gone, so knowing it's reputation from Trip Advisor, we joined the line inside for breakfast. It still took a while to get served & then seated but it was well worth the wait. The breakfasts here are truly excellent & if you're visiting SF, Mama's is unmissable. Annoying though queuing is, this place is definitely worth it. Go!

I read a number of glowing reviews about Mama's. However, I was very disappointed. What those reviewers failed to say is you have to wait on line inside before you get to sit down, you must decide what you want while standing there craning your neck to see the various menu's, seating is very tight, and the prices are ridiculously high. Lot's of folks say their food is good but who can't put out a good meal at these prices. Breakfast for 2 cost us $42.00 and by the way I wasn't really thrilled with my Farmer's omelette for $14.50, the potatoes were so so, and if you don't like a really strong cup of coffee you're in the wrong place. Frankly, I walked out feeling I got ripped off.

Please note that only cash and debit cards are accepted. There is a small sign in the window that states that cc are not (bc of the popularity of the place, the wait can be 30 minutes or more. We were told the weekends could be even longer.) There are banks in the area. I walked two blocks down to one. Now after after all that, the cooking was excellent. The special at the time was the French Toast sampler with strawberries, bananas and blueberries. I must admit I was conflicted in what I wanted to get. There were so many good items to choose from. My wife had the Monte Cristo with potatoes and said that it was very good. The melon berry smoothie was interesting I was trying something different and it wasn't what I was expecting but it wasn't bad at all.

I waited 40 minutes to get a table and it was worth every minute. I thought it was great that the owner stood on the front step and talked to everyone in line. They serve coffee and water to you while you wait outside. The food was amazing! I wasn't hungry again until 6pm that night!

Amazing - worth the wait

Even with a 30 minute wait, you have to try this place. Amazing eggs Benedict and my wife had the pancakes. We also took a couple of the crumble cakes to have later in the day which were also fantastic!

So we were recommended Mamas by a friend, who warned that there may be a queue... we weren't prepared for an hour and a half though!We persevered and completely understand why people were waiting though! I had a Californian omelette and my wife had French toast... both were divine.Incredible food, good atmosphere and great service... what more is there you could want?!

Perfect breakfast

We loved this place. It is well worth the wait! Go there 20min before opening so you get seated in the first round! We loved the french toasts the most (with a side of bacon). Staff is lovely and it is nice to see the cooks fry up the food behind the counter.

Great Breakfast!

We read the reviews and had to check it out. Glad we did ! Had to wait outside for about 30 minutes on a weekday. Heard weekends are busier. You proceed to a counter and order then sit at your table and waitress brings you your food. It was delicious. We had omelette and French toast best we ever had. Also recommend the screwdriver with fresh squeezed oj. It was 5 o'clock somewhere lol.

This was recommended to us. Located in the Italian quarter. Queued for about an hour but was well worth it. Menu is extensive and delicious! Close to Coit Tower so do both and enjoy SF.

Ask yourself is any egg worth a 2 hour wait?

We live in SF and have been to Mama's twice only when we wake up at 6am and have nothing better to do. Is it a good breakfast? Yes. If I were from out of town would I spend up to 2 hours in line waiting to eat breakfast here? No Way. Is it the most amazing breakfast I've ever had No way! There are so many amazing bakeries and other spots in North Beach that are just as good I don't get it??? My tip to you is get there at least half hour before they open. Second tip once you get through the front for there is another line ;) so add wait time for that.

We went up to coit tower, saw Washington square and thought that would be a nice place to get something to eat. Got off the bus on the way back down and decided on mamas. Oh my What a choice! We got lucky and queued for about 20 minutes, maybe half an hour for a table for 5, lots of chatty staff and a clear barrier to the prep area to keep us amused and then we got our table and the food came, it was so good, we all had something different and each was as good as the other! My only complaint is we found it towards to the ebbs of holiday and I'm never going to eat the best burger ever again!

There is a lineup and it's not cheap. Make sure you like food if you come here. If Denny's quality and prices are more your style then maybe skip here. We had the crab cake Benedict and the corn beef hash. It was all incredible. The service is also friendly. I ran into a guy on the way to the bathroom (this is a bit of a downside as it's kindof like a campsite bathroom) who was very angry about the wait and the bathroom. Just make sure to are prepared and you will not regret your visit here

Arrived right before they opened on a Saturday and I didn't read the reviews that said "long lines or arrive early". We waited 1 1/2 hours before we got into the restaurant. But it was worth the wait! So next time we will arrive early! My boyfriends daughter who LOVES French toast said this was the best French toast she's ever had. The vegetarian omelette was excellent, the potatoes were crispy and the homemade jam for the toast was awesome. I understand why people (like me) are willing to stand in line for over an hour for breakfast. A restaurant with a lot of history and a great start to enjoying the weekend.

Visited Mamas a couple of times on our trip to San Francisco. The first time we queued for 45 minutes and the second over an hour. Best time to go when the queues aren't as long are Tuesday - Thursday around 1.30pm. The staff were extremely friendly and the food was delicious. If you have time to wait I would highly recommend this place. The Swedish cinnamon french toast with berries was SO good and my sister loved her Californian sandwich. Highly recommended.

I found this recommendation on Trip Advisor, and it did not disappoint. The food was awesome (and I am not a breakfast person)! This restaurant is family owned and operated, and the pride they take in their business is apparent in how they treat their customers. While waiting to place our order and be seated, we visited with several of the friendly workers. As other reviewers suggest, get there early! We arrived at 7:30 on a Sunday, and made it in the second seating. 

A must for San Fran!

Get there early, really early or be prepared to wait. We got there before 9am on a Thursday and the line was out the door and the length of the entire restaurant so it took about 20 minutes to get in the door. The doorman lets in one party at a time where you go into the inside line for another 10 minute wait for you to work your way up to the register to place your order. We are convinced that Mama's has the best breakfast sandwich in the city. The entire family loved their meal choices and the portions were so large that we were stuffed. We spent about $80 for a family of four. so while it's no longer the 50's prices that they still show on the wall it's not too bad pricing for the best breakfast in the city.

So often we go to restaurants with great reputations and end up a little disappointed as expectations fall short of delivery. Well not this place. Queued for about 15 mins at around 830 but well worth the wait with genuine efficient service, great food and a real feel good atmosphere. I'm an eggs benny fan and these were the best!!

We arrive to have breakfast at mamas at 7.45. There was already a queue to get in. We didn't get into the cafe until 8.45 because there were so many people waiting. Amazing the queue kept getting longer. I think I heard some one say the queue would be about 1.5 hours for people at the back. However when we got in the food looked and tasted fantastic. It was so worth the wait. The only downside was the single toilet. Really could do with some attention.

A Great Breakfast If You Have Time To Wait

This is an extremely popular breakfast/lunch place in North Beach. The decor is charming and it has to be one of the cleanest establishments I've ever visited. Every dish is of top quality -- the eggs, pancakes, baked goods, OJ - everything. Mama's has a somewhat unique ordering protocol. As you enter the restaurant you a guided to the cashier. Behind him or her is the full menu. You order and pay ahead of time and then find a seat. From that point on, you are served by very attentive and friendly wait staff. Your food comes to you quickly and efficiently.The place is so popular that there ALWAYS is a line outside -- even on weekdays! They only admit new diners when a table frees up. As a local, I often don't have time for the wait and either eat at home or at nearby Mo's Diner on Grant Ave. But if I was visiting, I'm sure I'd stand in line for the Mama's experience. Mama's opens at 8 AM and you get there a bit before that, you will be seated immediately. I'm just not an early morning person <g>.

I'll travel back to San Francisco just to eat at Mama's. Breakfast all day but you'll want to get to Mama's early. Lines tend to wrap around the block. The food is definitely worth the wait. Pancakes were awesome, topped with fresh fruit and confectionary sugar that covers the entire plate. I also tried the huervos rancheros; salsa and avocado were super fresh. Black beans and rice were spot on and perfectly scrambled eggs. One bit that surprised me most was how awesome the freshly squeezed apple and orange juices were. Their smoothie contained only fresh fruits and honey as a sweetener. The place was amazing from start to finish. Can't wait to go back!

weve been going here for years! We brave the early morning lines and waits as it is well worth it once you get in. on our last trip, I tried the breakfast sandwich. Sounds very mundane but it is anything but. brioche bun, well prepared eggs and an incredible sauce. Don't forget to take home some coffee cake. my favorite.

Beautiful cozy place. You will have to wait a long time (more than 1 hour in my case, but it was raining so it was a good plan). Excellent pastries. All type of puddings, waffles, eggs. All the carbohydrates and calories just in 1 meal. But it worth it. Not cheap.

This was my second time to Mama's. The line was much shorter than the first time. We probably waited for 15 minutes but I would have waited longer. I love this place. But, carve some time out for a wait just in case you have to. I don't know how everything tastes so magical at Mama's but I promise it does. Once you are inside you order your meal at the counter. It's hard to make a choice because there are so many options. I asked the waitress what her favorite was and she said the Mama's french toast sampler or the Monte Cristo. My daughter got the Mama's sampler and i got the California omelet. The sampler comes with 3 different breads (Cranberry Orange Bread, Banana Bread, Cinnamon Sugar Bread) with fresh strawberries and bananas on top. Our plan was to split the two dishes in half so we could try it all. Seriously do this!The omelet comes with your choice of bread and country style potatoes. You'll need to pay with cash and it's a little pricey (but worth it). Then they will seat you. The omelet was perfection. Perfectly crisp bacon, avocado and monterey jack cheese. They bring this homemade jam to the table which is heavenly on the toast. The potatoes were good but super filling. Next time, I'll get fruit instead. My daughter's sampler was so good. Of the three breads, the cinnamon was my favorite but i also enjoyed the cranberry orange. My daughter got the banana smoothie which was one of the best I've ever tried. I got the fresh squeezed orange juice which was perfect. Leave a tip at the table for the friendly service. We also got the apple crumb cake and the chocolate crumb cake. Both were delicious. We were all sad when we were too full to eat any more.

We were informed that there is always a long line to get into this iconic SF restaurant. Unfortunately, the day we went to experience first hand one of their delicious breakfasts it was pouring rain, but that did not deter our party. Our group made the most of it by getting to know the other people sharing the line with us and asking the repeat customers what was their favorite dishes at Mama's. The system they have is pretty good and was working well that morning. You are let in and then place your order at the counter, then are seated at a table and quickly served your beverages. It took awhile for our meals to be served, but during that time our coffees and water were constantly being replenished. The servers were very pleasant and made some suggestions as to sauces, syrups, jams, etc. that would compliment our meal selections. All our food was made to order and was fresh, hot, and delicious. We were never rushed by the staff in any way, but when we were done we moved on to allow others to come in out of the rain and enjoy this wonderful experience. Some couples lingered well beyond finishing their meals and we thought them selfish, but the staff was gracious to them their entire time there. Yes, we will be back at Mama's next time we are in town. We will go close to when they open again (8AM) and we will wait patiently if we have to!!

After reading the reviews and receiving a few recommendations my boyfriend and I thought it was worth a visit. We had a nice breakfast, but unfortunately I don't think it's worth queuing for. There are plenty of other places which offer similar breakfasts so we were left a little puzzled why everyone chooses to wait for this one - we waited around 45mins, by which point my boyfriend was on the verge of serious Hangry so maybe that tainted the experience. Staff were really friendly and it's pretty cute and traditional inside.

The place is old school, that's why I think the service is so slow (in addition to the lack of room and not being capable to meet the demand). The food is good but I had very high expectations because of the reviews and I left wondering whether the 2 hour wait was actually worth it. Honestly, I didn't think so.

FOOD SAFETY GUIDELINES ARE HORRIBLE, HOW IS THIS PLACE ONE OF THE BEST...

Well we waited in a long line which I didn't mind. But it was when I stepped in and was waiting to order that alarmed me in every which way. I saw the cooks and the food safety handling "do not's" everywhere. From the food sitting out in the open with flies and gnats on it, to the cooks not adhering to simple guidelines. I only ate here because my friend convinced me to stay because we waited so long. So I had to suck it all up! But in all honesty, I will never ever eat here unless some drastic changes are made. I just don't understand how such a high rated establishment can display so many flaws. It makes me really wonder who is actually rating these places year after year. A simple solution would be to install door fans at every entrance and have the cooks follow simple guidelines. For those who go for the first time, be aware. And for those who frequent this place, you should be ashamed.
