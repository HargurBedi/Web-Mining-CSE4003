We were here on a Thursday evening (pretty early) and the place filled quickly. We ordered from the specials of the day and certainly enjoyed our meal.Preparation was quick with very generous portions. Service was good also. I asked for a glass of wine that they didn't have, but the waiter brought over two bottles to sample to see if they would work. A nice touch versus just recommending something else.Highly recommend giving the restaurant a try if you haven't been there before.

Trattoria Contadina Restaurant is a cozy family restaurant with excellent service and food. The same family owns and runs this restaurant for 3 generations. I thoroughly enjoyed the Pesce Picatta.. Red Snapper with capers, lemon, white wine and vegetables. Others in our large group chose a variety of pasta dishes - all were excellent. This place reminded me of the small, family owned and operated Italian restaurants in northern New Jersey that I used to enjoy when I lived there. I highly recommend it!

After reading the reviews on Trattoria Contadina I decided to try it for myself. There were so many good reviews for a reason. The restaurant is pretty small so you definitely need to make a reservation. We were seated right away and served almost immediately. The pasta dishes were so good. We shared a bunch of them. What stood out was the spaghetti and meatballs, spaghetti in white clam sauce and the penne fra Diablo. A few people had fish and veal in addition. Everything looked great, I think a lot of pictures were taken of the entrees and pasta dishes. Glad I looked up reviews and tried Trattoria Contadina. It was a good as everyone said.

Reservation made by a colleague of mine. Really small, very old school restaurant, but aestetics aside, AMAZING food and very friendly service. Shared a bunch of appetizers and all were delicious (eggplant, salads, proscuitto & mozz, pepper). I had the Spaghetti and clams for my entree, a bit different with added capers, but really really good. Had tiramisu for dessert and beyond delicious. I will definitely keep this one in mind the next time I am in SF.

We were able to get a reservation at this restaurant in short notice for my Birthday celebration; we chose it based on good reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp. We were not disappointed! We had a terrific bottle of prosecco; I ordered gnocchi, which was delicious and a very generous portion. My husband ordered spaghetti with clams, which he really enjoyed. We shared a great Caesar salad with anchovies my husband raved about. Our son ordered saltimbocca (veal with prosciutto) and his friend ordered spaghetti with meatballs--he completely cleaned his plate!Our waitress was wonderful (I unfortunately did not get her name) and brought me a candlelit piece of Birthday tiramisu at the end of our meal! We definitely would go back there; it appears to do a brisk carry-out business, which to me also is a good sign.

I don't remember who first told me about Trattoria Contadina, but if I could I would have to thank them. Every visit to San Francisco, dinner at Trattoria Contadina is a must. It's nothing fancy, just a little corner place in a residential area. What it has though is solid Italian food with a very comfortable atmosphere. After dinner, if you get lucky, hop on the Mason Street cable car for a ride back over Nob Hill.

This lovely restaurant was everything I'd hoped for when selecting an Italian eatery in North Beach. We were warmly welcomed, given a nice table, and service was attentive but not smothering. If you like a good Caesar salad, don't miss this one and add the anchovies - superb! My Il Diavolo pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente state and the sauce was just-right spicy. My sister loved her Carlesimo although the rigatoni could have used a minute or two more on the stove as it was a bit chewy. That said, the sauce was excellent, and we practically licked our plates clean. We still managed to enjoy dessert as we couldn't pass on the cannoli. As for drinks, my Dirty Martini was generously sized and the wine selection offered many good choices, even by the glass which is sometimes not the case. We were not rushed and allowed to enjoy our meal at our own pace. When next in SF, I will definitely return, and meanwhile highly recommend this restaurant.

Having stayed in North Beach and just in general enjoying Italian food, we wanted to make it a point to eat at such a place. This restaurant for us was easily accessible via cable car (literally along the line). Our order included gnocchi and risotto, along with complimentary bread. The food was good, and the atmosphere was pleasant, and seemed to have the vibe of a neighborhood establishment (although we weren't the only tourists there). The service was attentive and satisfactory. The place is a bit cozy, to put it that way, and reservations are highly encouraged.

My wife and I made a special trip here based on the T/A reviews. Old, family owned restaurant that must be living on reputation. Caesar salad for appetizer which was too fishy for my tastes. The anchovies must have been hidden within the dressing. Were we never offered ground, black pepper for the salad, although they did grind fresh psrmesan on for us. Glass of chianti was a bit sour and course tasting. We went for the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was not spicy and a bit acidic. Served with three meatballs that were dense with no breadcrumbs, a bit of garlic and overly salty. We did not have dessert. Check came to $68 plus tip. Will not return.

I walk past this place everyday, and it is always SO busy. Thus, I decided it was time for me to try. The entrees are a bit pricey but so worth it. The stuffed peppers with cheese was to die for.

I will go back here, again and again!

My friend and I came here without doing any research, because it was in walking distance of fisherman's wharf. We came around 5, hoping to get an early supper. Of course, the restaurant was BUSY when we got there. They asked if we had a reservation (we didn't) and then spent about five minutes figuring out where we could be seated. I'm so glad we got in! It was absolutely delicious. I had the gnocchi and was very happy with it. My friend had the diavolo, which she enjoyed. We had a few drinks and took a tiramisu back to our hotel room to enjoy later. I just wish we had ordered two- SOOOO GOOOD!

We walked a few blocks away from the wharf to this great family restaurant. Started with a negroni. DELICIOUS. Four of us had the gnocchi. It was light with a perfect texture and the tomato cream sauce was not too heavy. The pasta in my daughter's entree was perfectly al dente. Definitely worth the walk up a few not terribly steep hills.

4.5 stars for this gem of a generational Italian restaurant with a very reasonable price point. The service is great here and the small San Francisco neighborhood feel emanates from this charming eatery and albeit small bar. The dishes are consistent and most of them meet expectations. The burrata caprese is exceptionally good. Again, this neighborhood and friendly eatery are charming. The service is solid.It is also located on a cable car line if you feel especially lazy and don't wish to walk. Like with most places in San Francisco, don't even try to drive and park anywhere near here save a few nearby garages.

If you're looking for a good, basic SF Italian place this is the spot. It's a crowded, noisy place, with a mix of couples and families the night we visited.

We visited the Trattoria Contadina twice on our last visit to San Francisco. Happily, it was our "local" Italian, just around the corner from our apartment. It's located on the corner of Mason and Union Streets and has the ambience of a bustling, family owned local restaurant. I've been to numerous Italian restaurants over the years, including many in Italy itself and the Contadina is one of the very best. Unlike many other restaurants in the area it is not geared to tourist traffic but is rather aimed to serving a local clientele. Accordingly, both the service and food quality are exceptional and memorable for all the right reasons.The Contadina is obviously popular so reservations are highly recommended.

Spectacular, as usual.

Got the tip from the hotel concierge and when we arrived, we found a very small place, very cozy which spreads a family feeling. Menu is rather limited, we shared a carpaccio which was very good and after that, we had a risotto (unfortunately average), gnocchi (very good) and spaghetti vongole (excellent). The bottle of red wine we order (Montepulciano) was good, but too warm (not usual for an Italian restaurant). Service is average, although they really try hard to make it a good service. If you want to escape the usual tourist trap, this is the right place.

This is a classic, small North Beach restaurant with traditional, familiar Italian food and very moderate prices. A great family place, and a bit off the beaten track, no tourist hype here. I've been enjoying Contadina since the 1990s and this time was there with a 14-year-old boy who had just graduated from middle school and his mom. The boy has a typical teenage boy appetite(!), and he was very happy with hearty food and generous portions. The staff were concerned and careful about his serious shellfish allergy, reassured us but also checked in with the chef to be sure there would be no cross-contamination in the kitchen. If you want authentic food in a warm, welcoming atmosphere -- yes, eat here.

The restaurant is easy to find, it's on a trolley stop, very small and intimate and has a friendly bartender and waitstaff. I really don't remember what the name of our meals were but I do remember they were both delicious! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will return the next time we are in town!

We each ordered a different pasta dish - spaghetti and meatballs, Nicoletta and Gnocchi. They were all excellent, hot and perfectly prepared. A decent sized portion. Service was good but not intrusive. Coffee and a shared Neapolitan dessert finished us off. All in all a lovely neighborhood spot with really excellent food.

We made reservations for 6 p.m. but arrived around 5:15 and were warmly greeted and seated.Happy hour goes till 6 and you don't have to sit at the bar to enjoy. Antipasti:Castelvetrano olives lightly marinated and with fennel were delicious and h.h. at $2.50 instead of $5.Bruschetta with chopped tomatoes and ricotta at h.h. $2.50 a piece instead of $8. A glass of wine was $5 and perfectly made Cosmo with Tito vodka was $6. What a bargain for S.F.For dinner:Polpettine (spaghetti) with homemade meatballs (which they're famous for) with tomato sauce at $19. Delicious!Saltimboca (veal with prosciutto, mozzarella, sage, marsala , served with spinach, and garlic mashed potatoes at $31. So very delicious and filling. Meat was tender (personally I would of liked less sage), spinach cooked perfectly and potatoes with just the right amount of garlic. The two glasses of dinner wine, recommended by our server, were reasonably priced.Highly recommend reservations.

Nothing but love for this restaurant and those working there. I spent my 50th birthday evening with them and by the end of the night it was like we were old friends. We started the evening with a drink from Casey at the bar. Drinks were all good. Then were seated upstairs in a very cozy / quaint table. There were 4 of us - myself, husband and 2 older daughters. We started with the carpaccio and that was fabulous. Then we had 4 pasta dishes all served family style and all were great. Our favorites though were the gnocchi and the salvatore dishes. We also shared the meatballs and they were great. By the end of the evening, we had made friends with the lovely couple sitting next to us and enjoyed chatting with our waitress, Nicole. We finished our red wine at the bar after dinner with Casey (bartender), Nicole (waitress), and Vince (host?). They were so friendly and fun to talk to. This is not a pretentious place if that is your style. Very casual and fun with fabulous food. My new favorite SF Italian restaurant by far!!! Can't recommend it enough.

This restaurant is situated on a street corner whereby both San Francisco trolley cars and trams go by. It is accessible also by buses that stop right outside. On the ground level, request a table near the window to enjoy the ambiance!We were a group of 12 and although we could have been comfortably seated on the main floor, we were accommodated on the 2nd floor, where we enjoyed a more cozy, intimate feel, as though we were dining in a friend's home. The selections all were served with signature sauces. The roasted bell peppers with spicy tomato cream sauce were enjoyed by all. The tastes of our diners ranged from meatballs to pasta to fish, and each came with more than ample servings. I had the pesce picatta, which came in a lemon caper sauce and was light and tasty. I paired it with the grilled zucchini, which came with just the right amount of crispness and minimal seasonings so as to not obscure the fresh taste.The servers were attentive and accommodating of substitutions without chastisements or eye-rolling! We felt cared for without feeling like we were being continually interrupted.The pace was very slow, which made for each course to be enjoyed, along with the wine pairings and conversations.There is no question I will return to try other offerings!

My wife and I had dinner here at 5:00 on Monday, December 19th. I was hesitant to write this review because I don't want this little gem in North Beach to be discovered by the throngs of people I know will eventually make it their favorite Italian restaurant. To start with, it's on Mason Street a couple of blocks off Columbus Avenue, so you don't have to deal with all the noise and traffic. The place is quaint and quiet, and the people who work there could not have been more welcoming and friendly. We started off with clams and mussels as an appetizer, and it was outstanding. The bread was tasty and the olive oil they serve for dipping was extraordinary. We split a caesar salad, which is made with their homemade dressing, and it was superb. My wife had the Inverno Verde and it was, by far, one of the most delicious main courses we have ever tasted. The creamy pesto was the tastiest we have ever had. I ordered the Polpettine and it was the perfect blend of spices and flavors. The spaghetti was al dente to perfection and the three large meatballs were to die for! The amount of food they serve is more than we expected, and the quality was five stars. The tiramisu was the perfect end to one of the most outstanding Italian dinners we have ever had. It was truly an experience! We visit San Francisco several times a year and are always looking for the best Italian restaurant in North Beach. We found it!

He was responsible for my table/bar place ;-) and so he did a great job cause I was happy being there, enjoyed my food, had a great chat with him !!! It was the perfect closure for my solo evening in SFO ! The food was great and of a very good quality ! Top restaurant i could say xxx

Intimate small restaurant off the Mason cable car line. Happy hour here before 6pm is a tremendous deal. The burrata carprese bursts with flavor along with the btushetta. Fresh ingredients abound locally sourced. Impressive house red sangiovese. Then their cocktail and spirits list is as well. Try an old fashioned! The huge portion wedge insalata is enough to split for two. Once again flavors with every bite. It is difficult to choose your main entree. Pasta dishes you could split again with your special love. The veal dishes, saltimbocca with garlic mashed potatoes,correnti with penne pasta are standout favorites. YOU MUST RESERVE TABLE BEFOREHAND!!!!!!Club Fugazi featuring Beach Blanket Babylon show nearby fills this restaurant extremely quick !! Service can be spotty because of so many people to serve. Order all plates at one time but have them served at different staggered times. Tables are very small. Highly recommended. Mangia tutti !!!!

Great Italian in a quaint setting.

We visited Trattoria Contadina on our latest trip to San Francisco. The Trattoria is tucked away in a cozy little corner off Mason Street and is very unassuming from the outside. Once inside the restaurant is a bustling mecca of great Italian food. We started our evening off with Bruschetta. The Bruschetta was teaming with fresh tomatoes infused with fresh basil. Absolutely delicious. For our main courses we ordered three: Chicken with Prosciutto, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Fusilli Pasta; Spaghetti Bolognese; and Meatballs with Fettuccine. The chicken had a smoky flavor and was perfectly complimented by the prosciutto and tomatoes. It was complemented with a white wine sauce. We asked for the Bolognese to be spicy, and the result was fantastic - a great tomato sauce blended with pork and beef. The meatballs were also served spicy. The meatballs were moist and loaded with flavor. All meals were delicious and far more than most could eat for a reasonable price.The wine list was limited but had good diversity to it. The restaurant filled up quickly, so I recommend making your reservations early.All in all Trattoria Contadina was an amazing restaurant and has quickly moved up the scale as one of our favorite places to eat in San Francisco.

We chose this restaurant because of the good reviews. It is a small space, but has a bar. If we knew that, we probably would have chosen to sit at the bar. However, it was crowded and at least the table was by the window. The food was good. The wait staff is average. Food was delivered, but no follow up til we were finished. The Fruiti di Mare was very tasty but the veal was just ok. Coming from the northeast, we are spoiled for really good Italian.

We were looking forward to eating here based on all of the good reviews but was sorely disappointed. We arrived at Trattoria Contadina an hour earlier than our reservation time, but the host graciously gave us a table. This is a small restaurant and the tables are also small and cramped next to each other.We ordered a bowl of vegetable soup (of the day) which was barely edible. The broth was bland and oily and there were bits of hard inedible stuff, maybe pancetta, which definitely did not belong in a vegetable soup.For entrees, we ordered the Fruiti di Mare (mixed seafood and spaghetti for $25) and Veal Saltimbocca (for $29). Both dishes were just okay. No real flavor and overpriced.What made us decide to leave without ordering our usual desserts were the fruit flies that circled around the tables and the lack of service. The server only took our order and brought our food but did not check to see how we liked the food nor give any beverage refills.We love Italian food, but we won't be back to this place. North Beach has tons of much better Italian restaurants!

Off the beaten path in Little Italy, tucked into a residential area on Mason St. we lucked into this great little place. We were luck enough to get seated on a Saturday Night without a reservation because someone else was late (too bad so sad for them, lucky for us) I had the mushroom ravioli, it was divine. It was served with the very light, creamy marsala sauce. To die for! I am getting hungry for it again. My daughter and friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, they said that is was wonderful. The girls shared the Lemon White Chocolate Champagne cheesecake. Very delicate flavors, I only had a taste but the devoured it!Highly recommend this place. Service was wonderful!!

We ate here on a wet night, jumped off the cable car and straight in the nearest place to keep dry. What a lucky find! Olives and bread to nibble on while we waited. The meatballs were delicious. Not cheap but then nothing in SF is, so we felt we had good value for a really tasty meal.

We found this restaurant based on previous reviews and figured we would give it a try...very intimate and cozy, excellent staff, and the food is AMAZING! Was hands down my favorite meal on vacation, can't wait to come back and eat here again!

We arrived for an early dinner with no reservations and fortunately got a table upstairs. The cozy dining room welcomed with a warm and vibrant atmosphere. The diverse menu offered choices but not too overwhelming. Our server was personable and offered good feedback. I got the vongole- clams were nicely seasoned and pasta was just right. My dining companion had the chicken- the sauce was scrumptious (yes, I had some of that!) with ample portion! This is a jewel of a find - away from the touristy street.

My wife And two girls went there. We knew that its about 45 min anywhere to get a table here in San Fran. BUT. This Restaurant owns the worst lady Host. We were in Union square waiting for about 30 min to get on a Cable car. The kids need it to eat, we all where hungry. This person at the door was the worst, we got a look from her like what are we doing in her place, I spotted no kids. And was 1:30 minutes before they close She said is just reserve tables and took a call. Giving my wife a look that I saw from outside. I said to my wife let's go, their are many other places down in Columbus ave. We had a much pleased time in other place. My point is, the look was not necessary, rude and out of times. Maybe the food can be super good, but a Host that has that kind if issues, sorry and we spent a good amount of money in a very great restaurant much more friendly.

Love intimate style restaurants and this one is as cozy as they come. The noodles are hand made and delicious. The sauce is extremely tasty and the service is very friendly. Great wine selections even by the glass. We even saved room for an Italian coffee. In a town where cafes fight for who has the best Irish coffee this one has a twist on it with and Italian coffee made with frangelica

Competent, friendly service; wonderful pasta and meatballs, as well as chicken parmagiano. In a city with 400 dollar a head restaurants, it is a pleasure to find an old-school, reasonably-priced restaurant only a couple blocks off Columbus St in North Beach. Get there before 6p and enjoy happy hour prices - $6 cocktail was fantastic. Loved their homemade sorbet too.

If you're looking for something that doesn't feel over-touristed, this is it! Small, corner restaurant, closely spaced tables, lots of ambient noise and absolutely terrific. Food and service were superb. Costs are extremely affordable. Cable cars run past the windows. What more could you want in a lovely Italian meal in San Fran?

I would have likely scored Trattoria Contandina 5 for the food as well as for the very reasonable pricing and the decent service. But the ambience killed the deal and made our dinner much less enjoyable. We sat in the second floor, which is not large, but was full, and the noise from the tables around us made it impossible to talk. We couldn't hear what our other people from our party said from across the table. It was hard to tell if this is because some of the other tables were exceptionally noisy, or because how the restaurant sits people, but the bottom line was that it was impossible to hold a conversation. Still, the food was great. I really enjoyed the Pasta Primavea and my dinner party liked the spaghetti with meatballs and the tiramisu.and the price was definitely reasonable.

Thank the food gods for this neighborhood gem! From the moment you open the door, the smells and sounds of this trattoria will make you drool! We were a large group and were seated upstairs, At first, it felt cramped but as the room filled up, we were happily drinking and checking out the menu! The vongole did not disappoint and my dinner companions were too busy eating their ravioli and polpettini to even glance my way. You know the food is good when nobody is talking.

After climbing Lombard Street with the children we all wanted pasta. We asked a local walking her dog for a recommendation and she pointed us here. We were not disappointed. Great menu and wines. Kids loved it. We had a great window seat and enjoyed eating with the locals. The kids loved the menu and the drawing on the paper table covers.

Great service, but just ok meals. Tortellini with prosciutto, peas and Parmesan in a cream sauce. Didn't taste like fresh made tortellini, I thought it was probably brought in not made on premises. Lamb rack, tasted more mutton. Not bad but have had better. Carpaccio was lovely, great flavour , thinly sliced. Nice atmosphere and very busy.

Visited with my wife whilst on our first trip to San Francisco following recommendation from local. The ambience is fine and the staff very welcoming however the food was very disappointing. The pasta in both our dishes was over cooked. (Note to chef, all pasta should be served 'al dente' not soft and stogy)The sauce on my wife's dish was a thick green stogy cream whilst my meatballs were nothing more than balls of garlic sausage meat which left a horrible Certainly not classic traditional Italian dishes and not somewhere we would visit again or recommend.

I left my heart in San Francisco but I found it at Trattoria Contadina. I have enjoyed this restaurant every time I visit San Francisco since the 1980's. This small restaurant is a family operation with original dishes from Italy and definitely the best Italian restaurant in the city. Extensive wine list. We enjoyed the Caesar salad and a delicious veal dish. Fresh fish every day is what is found by the chef every morning at the fish market. Book a reservation here as the restaurant is small.

We had a wonderful dinner here last week. The food is spectacular - simple and family style, full of flavor and fresh ingredients. The service was perfect and the atmosphere just what you would expect from a family trattoria. It's just out of the madness of North Beach and although the menu is small, it's wonderful. The wine list is also good. The next time we're in the city, we'll be going directly here! Reservations recommended.

A few blocks off the beaten path, but worth the walk. we kind of stumbled on this place then read the good reviews so we gave it a try. It's not a big place so a reservation is a must. The staff were excellent. we were greeted immediately and had a short wait at the bar for our table. Server was so nice. We had Veal and shrimp dishes along with a ceasar salad. We're from the Northeast and we seldom get good italian when we travel, but this was excellent. Read sauce was flavorful and not too spicy and all the ingredients were fresh and the portions large. Pasta was freshly made and cooked perfectly. Would highly recommend this restaurant.

My wife and I ate here after seeing a show nearby. It's a great spot just off the main tourist area, so quality is much better compared to other places nearby that we tried. Service was excellent from the start. We had a couple of the happy hour food and drink specials, very affordable and delicious. Also we the beef carpachio, pasta Pavarotti and veal saltimboca. Pasta was good without being spectacular. All the other dishes were great and decent portion size as well.
