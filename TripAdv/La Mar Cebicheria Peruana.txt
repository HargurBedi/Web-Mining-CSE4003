Came here with friends. First we enjoyed a drink on the bar prior to our restaurant booking. This is a pleasant spot for a chat! Food in the restaurant was good and we opted for share plates. I particularly enjoyed the empanadas... Service was good and given the size of the place, food was delivered quickly. The wine list was good too. Only downside for me was that the restaurant was noisy - in a nice way from people enjoying themselves - but still noisy.

This is a large, spacious and airy restaurant overlooking the bay. The ambience is casual and relaxed. The serving staff are friendly and very helpful. And the good is rich, spicy and beautifully presented - and with a nice Peruvian slant. It's not Michelin star standard,perhaps (although we've been to Michelin starred restaurants in New York where the food wasn't as good as this). But, in terms of value for money, it's a real bargain. Our meal, consisting of two generous starters and an immense - and immensely tasty - main, plus a bottle of wine came to just over 140 dollars. Highly recommended!

A restaurant with an embarcadero-waterfront location almost always scares me away, I just imagine scads of tourists and subpar food. However, I was impressed by the variety and quality of our meal. I plan on returning to order selections which pair better, as opposed to getting the tasting menu experience. We had dinner there, but it looks like a great business lunch setting with a great view and reliably good meal.

This was our second visit to La Mar Cebicheria Peruana ... and both times our dining experience was beyond excellent (dinner and lunch). This is an expensive restaurant, however, you are paying for quality in both service and quality of your meal. They have a good wine list, and great choices of food.

A first time visit with friends who knew the restaurant well,I was delighted to visit finding a comprehensive listing of sea food specialties obviously fresh each day being a sea port town and on the ocean.There are so many wonderful things to try with an enormous choice of mixed seafood,the portions are not large but adequate and pricey unlike Miami where I live.We all had varied ceviche fish pieces and other mixed seafood cured in lemon or lime juice,they continued with similar for their entrees and I ordered Jalela possibly its the wrong spelling but is a nice size plate of deep fried fish pieces mussels calamari or octopus,it is pronounced Ha-laya and was plentiful enough to share.Great views and ample seating,great service and delicious food.

I have only had Peruvian food a few times, but always enjoyed it. This was no exception. The restaurant is in a beautiful location, right in Pier 1-5 and the decor is striking with electric blue chairs contrasting with the overall charcoal tones. I had the tuna cerviche and the steak. Both featured extremely fresh and high quality ingredients prepared perfectly. Dishes are simple and simply presented. Service was helpful, friendly if a little too fast. A nice experience in San Francisco.

I came here cause I wanted two things and I wanted them really bad. Pisco Sour and some Ceviche. I walked in off the street and didn't even have a reservation. I was either very lucky or the hostess could see how serious my need was. I did have to wait, about ten minutes and then they brought me back. The place was packed so I highly recommend you get reservations. They sat me down at a table for one, and gave me a menu. I said not need, one Pisco Sour and some of the house Ceviche. He said "Yes of course" and in ten minutes out came both. They were perfect-o!I was in and out in 30 minutes and extremely satisfied. Some things you need to know about this restaurant. It is pricey, its fine dinning, and its noisy, but that is the sign of a good Peruvian restaurant.

Simply put, delicious. The ceviche was a huge portion - enough for 2-3 people - and was perfectly seasoned. The beef dish did not disappoint. I only had time to sample one cocktail, the 'El Cholito' which I would not repeat - I get the sense the bar does some awesome things. The staff were friendly and attentive. This was a fine dining experience in a relaxed environment. Definitely worth going out of your way to try.

La Mar Cebicheria Peruana was a great find for a weekend dinner in San Francisco. The wait staff was very attentive and explained the menu well for us. At one point during the meal, the manager stopped by and asked about our experience. We had a very nice chat with him about the food and Gaston Acurio, the originating chef. The nikei ceviche is wonderful. Wish we had done a tasting. We also loved pescado anticucho. There were so many things to try. Might be nice to go with friends so that one can taste many of the interesting menu items. It was surprising how in a short amount of time we were full, but wanted to taste more. Finally dessert, choco-maracuya, which was wonderfully lite and tasty. The only negative would be the price. All those choices do add up. But we had a wonderful meal and experience and we look forward to going back again and to sit outside in the patio.

La Mar is right on The Embarcadero in SF. You can see the water from the window seats inside and, of course, the outdoor patio. You feel the buzz and energy being inside the restaurant whether sitting at the bar or in the main restaurant areaThe menu is so unique that you need the waiter to describe all the options. Luckily the waiters are very knowledgeable and eager to help. Take advantage of the Peruvian differences. Order a Pico Sour or their Smoky Rum drink.

Had lunch here with family. Enjoyed the food but thought it was overpriced for the quantity provided. Had a crab sandwich that was small and had no accompaniments with a price of almost $20. Taste was good. Enjoyed their fresh fruit sorbets. Others in the group had ceviches that they enjoyed. It is a large restaurant so very noisy. Attentive wait staff. Thought the specialty house drink "pisco sour" was overpriced at $13.

Noise Unbearable, Private Party during regular hours...left without dinner

Our party of three were excited to eat at La Mar, as the reviews were excellent and one of our party had been there before for lunch. We arrived for our post-matinee Theater dinner at 5:20, being told seating started at 5:30 and we could wait in the bar....The bar was full of people all wearing white...yes they were hosting a white party and the bar was overflowing, no where to sit, one waiter and when we were able to flag down this poor server we put in our order. 15 minutes later, with no drinks, I went to the hostess and asked if we could just get seated and have the drinks delivered to our table....No, she said, we had to get them from the bar...Seriously? So I flagged down the waiter and bless his heart he pushed our order out and we were on our way into the restaurant. The noise....OMG the noise. The entire area outside the back entrance on the water was packed with the private party. No where in the restaurant was immune to the booming music and the raucous noise. Our waiter arrived, apologizing...he looked as distressed as we were. We realyed that we were not going to spend our dinner time shouting over the din and he completely understood. I booked us at a lovely place in North Beach, we tipped our waiter (totally not his fault, why should he suffer) and we went off. My two star rating is not about the food or the service but about a restaurant that should have closed to the public for the evening to accomodate the private party. Greed? Who knows but really bad timing and a bad taste for a future visit.

This is were my wife wanted to go for her birthday & I'm really happy she chose this place. Everyone here was great, service was fantastic. We sat in the outdoor space in the back, under a heater. The night was beautiful but a little chilly.So many items to choose from, so many dishes we wanted to try. So we settles on eating starters as our dinner. We started with the ceviche tasting platter, 3 different ceviche (tuna, halibut, scallops/shrimp) served with fried plantains/potato chips for scooping. I was blown away by how fresh & good this was. Next, we have the Causa Limena, which is a whipped potatos with crab & avocado on top. Very interesting & tasty dish. We decided to try the Arroz La Mar, which is a seafood Paella. This was excellent. It was so delicious, I don't think we spoke until it was gone. There were 4 other dishes we wanted to try but we were too full.I highly recommend visiting La Mar for lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to go back.

My Peruvian guest strongly suggested this restaurant for us to try. He had tried it while in Peru and loved it but was told that the sister-restaurant in San Francisco was the best representation in the world for Peruvian cuisine. He was sorely disappointed.All of the meats (we had chicken, beef, fish and even beef heart) were seared on the outside and raw in the middle (chicken was cooked just a bit more than that). The chef considered this "medium-rare" we were told. We had them cook it a bit more and it came back with the fish completely over-done with the other meats in various forms of not acceptable. We also requested (and chef accepted) when we made reservations the day before, that we would like to have some of the sauces to be devoid of heat-spice. That was then not prepared that way and again, had to be sent back. There were a couple of tapas however, that were very good and beautifully plated.The service was also less than acceptable for a "high-end" restaurant. Drinks took forever to come, the wait staff didn't pick up empty glasses until end of meal as well as other small details that were missing.My Peruvian guest said there was very little that was of true Peruvian cuisine and will never return, nor will I. We even checked the dessert menu and that too, nothing indigenous to Peru.

Great place to meet friends and family for good food and cocktails. It's at Pier 1 1/2 In San Francisco, right by the Ferry Building. We parked at a lot right across the street for $25. The food was delicious but pricier than average Peruvian restaurants but the ambience is great, it's right on the water and you can tell they try to do more with each dish. The beef in the lomo saltado was very tender, ceviche was fresh, Dungeness crab over purple potatoes was delightful, prawns over rice made for a pretty tasty paella. We ordered 2 desserts and they were just ok. But the cocktails made up for it. The prickly pear margarita was the favorite at our table. Reservations are highly recommended and outside seating is ideal. We're already planning to come back on our next get together!

We had the opportunity to eat at three of Gaston's restaurants while in Peru last month for a family vacation. Those restaurants in Peru are known as some of the best in South America and beyond. When we heard that Gaston was also the owner of La Mar Cebicheria we wanted to give it a try. We were not disappointed and it reminded us a lot of Peru. We started off with a Pisco Sour and a Pisco Punch. Just like in Peru. I also had a Cusquena beer. Just like in Peru. It was if we were back in Peru. LOL The food, service and atmosphere also reminded us of Peru. The drinks, croquetas, arroz and plancha were all cooked, spiced, and prepared with a Peruvian flair. The total bill for two was about $180+ with tip and San Francisco "Mandate" (tax). It was well worth it for a special occasion to remind of us our recent trip to Peru. It's a beautiful country with a rich history, with beautiful people, and great food. The restaurant is also tops for Peruvian food in the San Francisco Bay Area.

We were in search of a memorable place to eat dinner on the last day of our vacation in San Francisco, and we won the lottery with La Mar. We dropped in without a reservation, and were given a table right away with a stern admonition that we had to be done by a certain time. The food was amazing; the presentation unforgettable; the service, impeccable. As people came pouring in, the noise got to be a bit much, but not unbearable. I would highly recommend it! PS: We finished in good time, without having to be escorted off the premises. :-)

This was the priciest restaurant we visited in San Francisco during a recent vacation. However, you will probably find that the excellent location at Pier 1.5 right on the water and great food make it worth the cost. We ordered Plancha Marina (prawns, calamari, catch of the day, seasonal vegetables), Arroz Con Calamares (grilled salmon-stuffed squid over wok fried squid-ink infused rice), Arroz La Mar (shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, catch of the day, vegetables, arborio rice), and a sashimi appetizer. I had the salmon-stuffed calamari over squid-ink rice and it was fabulous, so good I'm going to try to duplicate it when we return home. Everything was excellent and the server was very attentive and friendly. However, we ended up spending about $75 per person, including tip, so don't be shocked by your bill.

The menu at La Mar is confusing in at first but the (I think the authentic Peruvian waiter) did an excellent job of helping us to understand it. There are several options in each kind of dish for example something similar to ceviche, others similar to sushi, paella and a mashed potato host with lots of delicious choices. All excellent.The cebiche or ceviche was amazing and we only tried one. Fresh fish squid, shrimp a little spicy but great . Not that I would know but La Mar seems to have an authentic Peruvian menu. Many of the dishes are unusual and delicious. I think a lot of Japanese settled in Peru so there is a strong presence of Japanese items in a Peruvian style such as sushi. Then there is the Spanish influence in something like Paella. We didn't even get to the meats on a skewer which we should have. We tried the empanadas which were good but not so unusual. We want to go again and try more things. But we have to wait until we return to SF. We would definitely recommend it!

The waiter pointed out the specials and cautioned us that one would likely feed us both. We had Ahi Cebiche and shared the sea bass. The bass was delightful. Skin was crispy fried with a gluten free crust, served with yucca, squash and other vegetables. There was so much, in spite of our attempts, we were not able to finish it all.

Large interesting space. Very good food -- plantain chips & the hot sauce they come with are positively addictive. Excellent ceviche (I had classico) and lomo saltado (Peruvian beef dish). I was served the wrong dish -- wanted seafood w/ rice, got a salmon dish instead -- even though I was OK w/ that and enjoyed the salmon, the manager took it off the check. The waitress had ordered the wrong thing -- and never came by to explain or say "sorry." She also served us wrong wine. We didn't mention this, as the wine we got was very good, but they lost an extra $20.

This is a big restaurant down on the water. With that does come a bit of a tourist attraction feel, but I can't really say that's much of an issue here. For some reason, after reading reviews my impression was of a more upscale restaurant, but although it's a nice looking place, people of all walks of life (and how they dress) eat here. Main disappointment - sticky table. Hate that. Our waiter (Argentinian) was super friendly and helpful (if in a slightly production line manner; consistent with the size of the place). We ordered one of their multiple selection of ceviches and were pleasantly surprised with how much food there was and how great they tasted. We had a couple of other dishes, but I'd summarize them as "forgettable". We certainly enjoyed our dinner here and would def come again - but only for the ceviche.

We visit San Francisco twice a year, and always have new restaurants on our radar. The results can be mixed, but La Mar is definitely a winner. Recommended to us by a friend, it was actually better than his review indicated. Sitting adjacent to the Ferry Building, the restaurant is big, airy, and has great views. The staff is super attentive, but the bottom-line for any restaurant is the food, and that's where La Mar really shines. The seafood dishes were delicious, creative, eclectic and fun. And while not best of all (again, that would be the food)l, i can add not terribly expensive. When we left Friday night around 9:30, the bar was buzzing.

Really love the Ceviche in here the mixed done for a starter was very good and super fresh with lots of flavours and fresh herbs. We ordered some empanadas and to be honest they don't really go with Ceviche and then the main courses are very filling the rice dish with pork is delicious but really better as family style rather than for one person.All in all enjoyable and the starter was the highlight. Very big wine list with a few bargains but generally high prices. Overall the bill was was too much for what we had - crazy San Francisco pricing for 3 people over $300 and if I am honest not value for money but it was packed so I guess no-one cares except me!I could happily sit here and just have ceviche with a nice bottle of chilled white wine and that would be a better experience,

This restaurant is a somehow hidden gem. It's located in the pier area where you expect more turistick-y places, however, this place is none of that. Instead, they have a very Peruvian food with very artsy approach to it. To make it the perfect combo, put that together with the great location that allows you to eat enjoying a view of the bay with all the boats and ships: it was rainy and windy when and watching those boats been shaken by the waves was a great spectacle while eating.

Absolutely delish! For dessert I had the tres leches with strawberries and freshly made vanilla ice cream. We sat on the shaded patio with a beautiful view of the water and boats of all sizes. The interior of the restaurant was colorful and comfortable. Superb service, excellent food, and beautiful views.

Always a pleasure

Great place with great ambience on the waterfront. We were lucky to get a good table facing the pier. Service is good with friendly servers. Food is of course the talking point. It's very flavorful and the cebiche especially the Nikei is excellent. Very fresh and bursting with flavour. The lamb and Alaskan Halibut were yummy. The only negative was the Californian halibut which was average and there was not much to attract in the desert menu.

I want to make this sort of food !

First time trying Peruvian food and was not disappointed. From our first greeting and throughout our meal the service was great. Matteo our server was excellent and his knowledge of the wine list helped immensely as I am not that familiar with all the California wineries. The food was amazing. Matteo selected a mix of cebiche and warm appetizers that really were fantastic. For dinner I had the Plancha Marina. Yummy. Highly recommended. 

great location, lively bar scene and good food

We three started in the bar around 3:30pm tried all the little bar eats, had a few drinks and then had dinner. Seats at the bar are like parking spots hard to get. Good people watching from the front window of the bar. Sat in the dining room that faces the waterfront and watched the boats. Three people in our party. Each of us had a skewer of either chicken, beef or fish. The desserts were very pretty and tasty. Staff very good. My friend paid the bill so don't know the cost probably over $100.00

We went this restaurant for early dinner. We were a group of 12 people with 4kids. As you can imagine, not an easy group to accomodate. But everythig worked perfectly. We ordered to share. Portions were reasonable size but very tasteful. Ceviches were interesting but very ymmy. Presentations were exquisite. I believe it is rather overpriced but it is located right at the harbor in SF, so what do u expect?

Water view! Super Waiters! Food beyond the imagination! You either need to make reservattions or be early. The specialty cocktails are so fun and original. Try at least one per person. All of the fresh fish is well very fresh! and fun. The preparation is a presentation in itself. I had a caulifower and fish dish that looked totally different from a table next to me. It's all fun and so delicious. We ate for lunch so the views are amazing of the bay; however at night the interior is well decorated and I can see a high vibe attitude inside. Cerviche is a must - they do have alot of other options besides fish - we just happen to love fish!

Good food. Pricey.

We met up with my relations and decided to try this restaurant. We were lucky as we did not have a table booked, however we had a drink at the bar and were advised we could have the "walk in table". The menu was extensive and as you might expect comprehensive. We took our time and decided what we were going to order. The waiter then proceeded to advise us what he thought we would like to eat, so we went with his recommendations. The food was first class and the portions were not to big with clean plates all round. We would recommend this restaurant if you wanted to try a new culinary experience.

This is our first visit to La Mar. My husband had a nice ceviche lunch dish with a light vinegrette and roasted corn kernels. I had the chicken empanadas which had alot of meat inside them. It was not crowded like many other places along the embarkadero. We were seated right away. It was between busy places. I would come back.

Sponsored a corporate dinner at the the chef's at Le Mar. They don't have a private dining space, but the chef's table is away from the other main dining area. Food, wine and overall experience were just fantastic. There's quite a number of interesting and different plates. Clients loved it! They have a very extensive wine list. Try the "Vik" Cabernet if you want a memorable splug! It was recommended by the sommelier and I'll never forgot it; transformational for a wino!

I have been here for dinner and cocktails. I really like the tropical and airy decor. I feel like I have been transported to a beach club on the waterfront. I felt the service was lacking and slow. The drinks and food was just so-so.

Party of four for dinner. $288.00 later and poor service and a filthy bathroom. Food was tasty enough, especially swordfish, but causa sampler at $29 is baby sized, and the ceviche sampler has one or two pieces of fish per sampling. Also pricey at $32, I believe. Drinks range in price from $13 and up and cheapest beer is $8. Wine list too. There are just too many great cheaper Peruvian restaurants in SF to choose from. Definitely won't return. Absurd to pay more than $300 for dinner and have crappy service and a bathroom experience worse than a portable potty.

What a surprise!

My husband accompanied me on a business trip and we decided to try out this Peruvian restaurant.The server was excellent, attentive without being overbearing. The food was artfully plated and tasted as good as it looked. It is obviously popular as every table was filled on a Tuesday evening so reservations recommended. Would definitely return.

Just steps from the Ferry Building, La Mar is an oasis from the bustle of the Embarcadero. The food is fresh and well prepared, with excellent cebiche and causas. The grilled beef was also excellent. While we did not appreciate the attempt by our waiter to upsell us to a $78 grilled octopus for lunch, we did appreciate the atmosphere and the presentation of the food.

High priced non typical Peruvian food
Rating: 3
Date: May 22, 2017
The location and place are excellent and the food tastes ok. However in an effort to make gourmet versions of typical Peruvian fair the cook fails in attracting fans of cebiche, causa, etc. The cebiche clasico had no resemblance to what you find in typical Peruvian foods and had about 6/7 pieces of fish, 3 little pieces of sweet potato and 12 kernels of corn. My wife had to ask for extra onions because the 5 slices she got were not nearly enough to enhoy the cebiche. We ordered the Causa Flight and what we got had nothing to do wiht the causa I grew up with. It was more like "poop" of different colors with crab or other things on top. Cannot let you know how disappointed I was at this highly recommended restaurant. Will never go back nor go to any other restaurant sponsored by the same chef and have mentioned this to numerous family members and friends.

Had a very dissapointing dinner here at La Mar. Sat at the bar on a Saturday evening (May 20th). Server made multiple mistakes. I originally orderred the Pollo Anticuchos but I got the Pulpo instead, told the food runner that I didn't order the pulpo. My partner orderred the Lomo Saltado, You pay $36 for a dish that is mainly onions,fried potatoes and 5 small pieces of meat. Wanted to get the attention of the Manager but it seems like he doesn't care at all. When we got the check, the amount on the receipt is different from the Menu. The Menu has lower prices and their system has a higher price. To the Management of La Mar, as a Restaurateur myself, based on my observation, La Mar needs more attention to details. Great service and Excellent food is what the restaurant is lacking. Not coming back.

Firstly, any restaurant with circa 300 seats with two toilets for everyone needs to have a good hard look. The excuse : the building is protected by some heritage order. OMG doesn't help the ten people waiting to go to the bathroom!Secondly the staff need to be trained on two important issues. If there is still food on any share plate don't take it until either you have asked or it is empty. And the kitchen staff need to ensure there is more than three small pieces of beef on a share dish, all Onions little beef! Suggest not a good place for groups. Disappointing.

La Mar consistently delivers. Their ceviches are always fresh, the service is friendly with a genuine South American flair, and the location is excellent - allowing for a beautiful after-dinner stroll along the Embarcadero. I believe that the restaurant is owned by the same owner of the restaurants of the same name in Lima, Peru and in Bogota, Colombia - and clearly they share more than just the restaurant's name. Our most recent visit was for my wife's birthday. I hadn't mentioned this in the reservation, but mentioned it to the waiter. They showed up with a thoughtful, small desert with a candle (free, of course) - a nice touch, without going overboard and bursting into a birthday song (the kind of thing my wife would not have appreciated...).Another example of their customer focus: when we ordered a second round of champagne, and had to check in with the waiter when they took quite a while to show up, they immediately offered the two glasses of champagne for free, along with an apology for the delay. You don't find that kind of customer service everywhere. In short: a wonderful restaurant, strongly recommended for when you visit SF, and for locals (like me) a great place to have on your list of favorite local restaurants.

My wife and I expected much more from this restaurant with all the good reviews it has. My review is based on what we ate and drinked this day. We had the Pisco drink, the first round tasted like egg, then we told our waiter and they put less egg whites on the next drink and was good. We had the cauliflower with Dunganess crab, but we did not taste any crab, it was all cauliflower, my wife and I thought that they bring the cauliflower first and then the crab but it appears is all mixed. We ate the cauliflower and then asked our waiter for the crab and she said that was it. For me it was a funny thing, not a big deal, it was just funny that we ate the cauliflower and then asked for the crab. We also ordered the octopus, it was good, the plantain chips were great too, we also ordered the paella, it was not a great paella. The place is great and the service was great too, but we thought we were going to eat better food. I am not saying not to go, I say give it a try.

We had a table for four for a late lunch at La Mar on a Saturday, and it appeared to be a busy day. Not having insight into what was going on behind the scenes, I'll give them them benefit of the doubt and say that I highly recommend them (although a couple of people at our table were very put off by the service, which was very, very slow. (Service is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars). To be fair, though, we only ate here once, so I have nothing else to compare it with except every other restaurant we went to in in San Fransisco -- all which had impeccable service. We had the crab sandwich, swordfish skewers, chicken skewers and swordfish meal. The crab sandwich was just alright, but the swordfish was amazing and made me wish that I'd ordered something from that side of the menu. The tables are very close together and made it a nice way to chat with other patrons and get a preview of some of the items on the menu prior to ordering :). While others at our table were adamant that they wouldn't go back because the wait was so long and the atmosphere was too loud, I would give them another shot to make up for the service and let the kitchen staff know that I appreciate their talents.

This is a very pretty restaurant overlooking the Bay. Service is excellent. Prices are high but reasonable. We loved the ceviche, as it was very fresh and delicious. But the rest of the meal was just okay. The fritas were boring, and the main course, a fish dish, was fresh, but the flavors were just not to our liking. We've had more interesting choices at other Peruvian restaurants in Chicago and Miami. But they weren't overlooking the Bay.

Special place for a special lunch with four best friends who have known each other for over 50 years. Ambiance was outstanding as the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors in the covered patio with a view of SF Bay. Food was presented beautifully - colorful, artistic and tasty. We had mushroom empanadas, causa limena and nikkei, loma soltado. We had an early lunch reservation on a weekday which is recommended because the outdoor seating area was full during the lunch hour.

Food is excellent - very tasty good variety and well presented - this is not in question. Was there for a business dinner with colleagues - our company is large and patronises this restaurant frequently. The booking was made for a larger group than we were when we arrived, and we had to wait 10min to be reseated at a different table as the restaurant needed to (I assume) reallocate the larger table that was originally allocated. Once seated, I would the service a little slow - for example it seemed to take a long time just to come and get our drinks initial drinks order. At the end of the meal we were shocked to see that they charged us for the people that did not come (especially given that they had understood this upfront and had re-allocated the original table) and it took some time for them to back down, but eventually they did and overall I think the food was good value for money, although the attitude of the restaurant left a bit of sour taste in the mouth.

Good food, atmosphere, service and view of the Bay.

This is a large restaurant and it can take more time to be seated than expected, even when you're the only one at the front desk. This is a large busy restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere.

Ordered empanadas which were great. Free Plantains were excellent. Lomo Saltado had stringy beef, only 4 pieces of small steak and was salty. Definitely not a highlight. Go to Limon instead. Chauffa was okay. Had to order second beer 3 times and took 20 minutes to arrive. All food including appetizers came at same time which was annoying. Probably not returning. Skip and go to Limon for sure, half the price but Twice the flavor.
