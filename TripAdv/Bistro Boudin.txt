Family time in SF

My daughter was home from college for the week and so we headed to SF for a family day. She had been here before and loved it and we were not disappointed. We started with the calamari and bowls of chowder, which my family loved. I had the sole for lunch and it was delicious and tasted so fresh. We had beignets for dessert which was the perfect ending to the meal. You have a great view and can smell the sourdough bread from the bakery below - the best.

Smelled the tang of the sourdough before seeing the bakery. Fairly confusing to see what line to go in to to order what. Employees serving seemed to be non-caring and not excited to be there. Clam chowder in bread bowls were great! A bigger bowl of soup would have been ideal though.

I had heard a lot about their bread bowl soups, so I just had to try it. It was good , but just too much bread and too little soup. The clam chowder was flavourful and the view of the pier was wonderful. The service was great and I will definitely go back again, but try something else on the menu.

We had a good meal here. There were plenty of gluten free choices.We enjoyed looking round the bakery too. It was really interesting to see how the sour dough bread is made. Luckily, we had picked up some gorgeous gluten free bread from the amazing Mariposa bakery in the Ferry Building Marketplace ,so didn't feel too deprived.

Have always wanted to eat at the restaurant here but by the time we had arrived it was getting a little late for brunch so we decided to grab some sourdough sandwiches and eat out on the back terrace. I grabbed the pesto chicken and my partner got the roast beef. Good sized sandwiches, very filling and good value for the money. Love sourdough bread. We could also see some of the Fleet Week airshow from where we were sitting.

More formal than the cafe. Full service dining. We were a group of 6 ( including 2 children and a vegetarian). Waited a short time for a table and were lucky enough to get a table I. The back room- slightly separate to the main room and much quieter. If you get a chance ask for that. The waiter was excellent- probably the best we had come across on that trip. Good service and a great sense of humour. Food was excellent; cocktails were excellent and service was excellent. Went for the chowder which was great but one of our party had the bisque, which I tasted and that was even better. Worth a visit and then make sure you walk through the bakery museum and watch the bread being made.

Classic San Francisco SourDough Bread and other tasty treats

Founded in 1849 and still using the same starter yeast culture developed during the California Gold Rush, Boudin's Bakery absolutely makes the the best sourdough bread in the city. Having lived for years behind their main bakery in the Richmond District at 10th Avenue and Geary, just the fragrance of the baking bread at this new massive store at Fisherman's Wharf rekindles many happy memories. You can watch the now highly mechanized bakery production, enjoy freshly baked breads and pastries, shop in the souvenir shop with all things Boudin and San Francisco, or have a sandwich or the classic clam chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl.(the soup is good but the bread becomes soggy.) While there are now several specialty bread shapes(crabs, lobsters, turtles, teddy bears), the real pleasure is of a crusty loaf, a slab of creamy butter, a piece of local Monterey Jack cheese and a glass (or bottle) of fine California wine for a picnic back in your hotel room.Their is a second floor restaurant with an interesting menu that we did not try on this visit.

The clam chowders in sour dough bread are amazing and good value for money. The seating area does get busy.Outside you can watch the bakers make the bread and they are really good. They make bread into different things ... Teddy bears, crabs and many more things. There is shop inside where you buy lunch and the shop sells the bread and other items. There is a restaurant on first floor ( but I didn't visit that)

This place had THE BEST Clam Chowder I have had anywhere! The Sourdough bowl was perfect!Also a plus is that they validate parking for the lot right next to the restaurant and they location is right at Fishermans Pier! The price is a bit high but the parking there is very expensive so the validation kind of equals it out. As an aside it is also pretty close to the cruise terminal!

The sourdough bread was good which the soup came in. I didn't try the homemade breads or desserts that they make.

I travel across 50% of the time and can not say enough about this Gem. Truly as good as it gets. Fantastic from the manager (Kelly who went two extra miles for us) to the serving staff and from the food to the ambiance. They took a party of 25 of my work colleagues from all over the world with a same day reservation, sat us together, took individual orders (no limited fixed menu I was offered elsewhere), charged individually, accommodated 4 languages and a special birthday. 5 star Execution was just the tip of the iceberg however. Anyone can go out of their way (although I could not find another place on the San Francisco waterfront that would) but to do that while getting rave cuisine reviews from two score of European palates in a relaxed friendly casual atmosphere is another thing all together. Definitely go here. I have been to several others on the water front and they are over done fish joints. This is two steps above.

Have been here with a Friend and had a Tomato soup in a sour bread bowl. As we are vegeterians, we ordered a tomato soup and a cheese sandwich in stead of their famous calm chouwder soup. I loved it and on a cold breezy day, the soup does wonders. The service was very good. Although there were many tourists in the shop, the service guys opened extra cash counters and so we could order food superfast. The service staff was very friendly and service was fast. They have many types of bread which they sell in the bakery section. They also have the museum where one can looka round and find out about their famous sour dough and then they have the restaurant and souvenir shop. Loved it and deifinetly recommend it for families, tourists, friends

I ordered a turkey sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder - should have just ordered the soup, the sandwich was nothing special but soup was delicious.

You order on the back wall and collect the food there- whilst hot drinks are ordered for you at another counter automatically as you place your order and you pick the drinks up from a counter on the other side. We had between us the sourdough bacon and cheese muffins (delicious) and the bacon waffle- huge and tasting amazing. Coffee is great and my highlight the cinnamon rolls- absolutely dribble inducingly luscious.

Best chowder!

The clam chowder was great but ordering then picking up a bit confusing I waited 15 minutes for the soup and then had to ask Was told they called my name earlier but no answer As I was standing right at counter doubtful I wouldn't have heard them

Love that Sourdough bread!

Stopped to get some sandwiches to take back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing. The food is excellent. The sandwiches and salads are freshly made and the bread is the best!

Average chowder, fantastic sour dough!

Here's the scoop. Yes, this is a super busy, touristy location. But, guess what? If you are reading this review, chances are you are a tourist!! Get over the crowd issue and just hop in line. The line moves quickly. And, quite frankly, there is nothing better than a big bread bowl with chowder and a beer to settle those tourist nerves. Sit outside and enjoy your chowder.

Underwhelmed

On the outside this looked very interesting. Went for breakfast one morning. Expensive for what it was and found the experience a disappointment.There are positives...There's lots of good things in here if you want to shop for specialities. The sourdough bread from the bakery is fantastic and worth getting on its own

Good as ever

Went for lunch here. We were impressed last time we were in SF, so went again. The queue was massive and the prices are still a bit high but the food was once again good.Bread bowl with chowder, soup or chilli- cant go wrong!!!

The best Clam Chowder on Sourdough!

We had the best Clam Chowder on sourdough at Bistro Boudin! Will always come here for their Clam Chowder on sourdough whenever I am in San Francisco. Lots of people on line to order food but the line went fast. Quick service! Great food!

They have two locations and we visited both places but ate at the location on Pier 39. The clam shower served on sourdough is a must. Their other pastries were excellent too. 

Just wow

I have been visiting Bistro Boudin for many years and they are consistently tasty. Great service staff and a nice second floor outside dining area facing the wharf. We had the required clam chowder in sourdough bread bowl, calamari, and fish & chips. All were cooked to perfection. They also have a nice little museum about the history of the company and a direct view of the bread baking operation. The sourdough smell is wonderful!
