Tadich Grill, the best grilled salmon on the planet! We have been dining here since 1988 we once lived in the City. Probably eaten here 50 times and every time the service, ambiance, quality of food, value is just perfect. The bartender still shakes one of the best martinis in the city. So great this establishment has maintained for 150 years....

Top notch restaurant. They don't take reservations but the wait at the bar is fun. And when we were there spots for 2 along the bar opened up a few times. efficient bartenders serve you, all dressed in formal whites. Incredible service, incredible food. The cheesecake is to die for, and the pan fried sole incredible. Tonnes of food. next time I want to try the lobster! What a great third generation institution that has not lost an smidgen of quality or service.

We had the pecan chocolate pie... gorgeousThomas our server was great, knowledgeable and friendly- made us feel very comfortable.Would come back again for sure.Go sit at the bar and have martinis.

Went here in April of 2017, i got the NY Strip. One of the 5 steaks I ever ate. Came back 6 months later and it surpassed the last visit!

I had not been here in many years but went recently with out of town friends. It still has the old San Francisco charm. I loved the waiters I think they have all been there there for 30 plus years and are a fun group of guys who know how to treat customers. I had their delicious filet of sole that I highly recommend. If you want a slice of the way SF used to be, this is the place to go. I just love it.

A Must Visit Historical Restaurant in San Francisco famous for seafood

This was our very first visit to this 168-year-old restaurant. Very impressive food, especially the Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread, one of their House Specials. Everything was fresh and well presented. Our waiter David made great recommendations and was informative, friendly and efficient. Definitely adding Tadich Grill to our favorites.

I enjoy every meal I have here. They have access to a great selection of fish. My favorite evening seem to be going with your traditional broiled steak. But really, the tepid steamed veggies and the limp plank potatoes have outlived their relevance. I don't need trendy options but do something to provide taste. Some spice and character, please. It makes me question whether I come back.You can hew too closely to tradition. Sure, the place has history and old school white table ambience (that is starting to strike me as way too loud by today's standards). I love the booths.But with the wine list so lacking in creativity and the ignorance of the means by which the vegetables can enhance the seafood - I look at a $200 bill for two and wonder: aren't there better experiences and quality to be found across San Fran for the money? This is not said without regret. I have been coming to Tadich since the 80's.I want to come back. I also want to leave with more of an enthusiasm for the food and less for the physical place or the nostalgic value it holds.So don't go all pretentious but its time to revamp the menu and refresh the vitality of the staff. Both are striking me as taking the customer for granted as times are a changing. The bar is higher today and Tadich Grill is up to the task. They just need to try harder. Bring back great food, good grog and a try a dessert cart, please!...and think hard about re-energizing the staff.

This place is a throw back with waiters that have worked in the industry for most of their life, in a building that goes back to the 50's and a restaurant opened in the 1800's. It's known for its great seafood and cocktails. It was the watering hole for San Francisco's own Herb Cain.The bartenders are very friendly and lively with conversation. It's a great place to stop in for a drink, happy hour, lunch or dinner. Beware, they do not take American Express (bummer).

People in the Bay Area love Tadich Grill precisely for what it is and what it isn't. It's an institution and an unfailing one, so long as you skip the desserts. I go there over and over, for the specials of the house and the expert, efficient and brisk service. If you want some waiter who preoccupies you with his name and fawns over your table all night, this is not your place. But if you want to experience a SF legend and enjoy the freshest, best-prepared fish and Dungeness crab in town, go to Tadich Grill. The wait at the bar is part of the fun.

We were anxious to try the Tadich Grilll based on its longevity and some of the reviews. I should have heeded the other reviews. It's a case of " the emperor's new clothimg - it may be the oldest seafood irestsurant in SF but when you cut past the former glorification , today it is little more than a slightly slower than fast food joint. Our waiter Marion was quite possibly the worst server I have ever encountered including drive through service. It started out with promise, the drinks at the bar were well made and served fairly promptly. Our table became available within 20 minutes. We were seated and the waiter showed up 10 minutes later. We had a few questions about the different types of fish, he interrupted one of our party mid sentence to state "it's all good I'll be back". When he returned was an exact repeat of interrupting someone mid request saying will bs back. At this point we requested a different waiter from the host who assured us the situation would improve. When the waiter returned he gave a lip service apology and proceeded to ignore us so much through the evening we were unable to order wine to accompany our meal. Food was not impressive at all. Plain steamed broccoli n carrots with plain Fish. Nothing seasoned. Clam chowder was good We skipped both dessert and a tip. We left never to return. I cannot believe the owners know what is going on because watching some of the others being served I suspect their experiences weren't much different. With so many other places to dine give this one a pass

A classic old style dining experience. Expect it to be busy and loud. Expect to wait but good bar service with friendly bartenders helps pass the time. This is the oldest restaurant in San Francisco and it oozes that ambiance. All the waitstaff seem to be veteran professionals and it really showed in the service we received. We ordered oysters half shell <warm and not good at all> for appetizers and Seafood Cioppino and Shrimp/lobster Newburg both of which were really good. .

Good initial vibe at the bar while waiting for a table, and expected the same when seated for dinner. Unfortunately didn't happen, including waited over an hour for a table when initially told 30 minutes, not initially told restaurant doors close at 9:30 pm, bartenders began cleaning-up/closing bar while we waited for our table, given menus at the bar and asked to be prepared to order when seated in the restaurant, hurried service when finally seated in the restaurant (including being asked to sign our credit card slip soon after it was set on the table so that the waiter could leave), dinner completed in less than an hour because of the hurried service, and food nothing more than good (fish was simply grilled with no unique flavors or sauces, hash browns were mushy, and vegetables were room temperature). Overall a disappointing experience such that this is the first time I've ever felt inclined to write a review on TripAdvisor. Hopefully others have been more fortunate.

Tadich Grill doesn't take reservations but we ordered drinks, sat at the counter and managed to get seated after around 20 minutes on a Monday evening - moving to another side of the counter to eat. So far, so good.The ambience is loud and bustling with 'mature' waiters in white coats patrolling an imposing island bar that stretches almost the full length of the restaurant to the kitchen where you can see the chefs at work.Only problem is what they produced was distinctly underwhelming - particularly for the price.The starter - a shared seafood platter for two (between three of us) - was the best thing we ate. Comprising of fresh oyster, fish, crab, squid, prawns and much more on a bed of lettuce, the smoked trout was exceptional.For main course I opted for what appeared to be their signature Seafood Cioppino with garlic bread. Portion size was large and there was no shortage of fish and shellfish. The problem was the tomato based Italian-style sauce, gravy (call it what you want) which lacked any punch and was too watery for my taste.To be fair my partner loved it, which is more than can be said for her own dish - seafood, wrapped in sole and utterly drowned in cheese sauce that obliterated the fish flavours. Perhaps, she ordered badly. The final dish was a good size portion of fish next to a mound of thick-cut boiled vegetables. The fish was decent but the rest was about as bland as the presentation.Overall, there's a buzz about the place and the service is excellent but our food lacked any wow factor. It was by no means dreadful but neither did it live up to the billing. We won't be rushing back - not least because we live 5,000 miles away.

A classic. An institution. A feel-good place that is the kind of place every major city has...the place where the established, old timers, celebrities, politicians, businesspeople etc. seem to gather for cocktails at the 100-foot long bar, and to be seated at a white-tableclothed table for fresh fish, raw bar and steakhouse styled salads and appetizers. The cippolino is fantastic and is in a tangy red broth and the Dungeness crab cakes are over the top delicious. Great for a business lunch or dinner, especially at one of the semi-private booths or just for drinks at the bar. No reservations accepted so you have to wait for a table, and no American Express.

Radish Grill is not for the impatient. They don't take reservations and the wait can be an hour or more at busy times (e.g. weekends around 7). But is worth it. The staff are delightful and so is the food. This is the place for fresh and varied seafood and a lively bar. It's old San Francisco and hasn't changed in decades. Prices are very reasonable. We ordered dinner salads that were loaded with crab and shrimp for under 12 bucks. Wow. The seafood salute is wonderful as are the almost limitless preparations and types of fish. Beef choices are available, but fish is th best choice. If you aren't impatient to eat.

Shrimp were plentiful but really not enough sauce. For our main courses. I picked Pan fried pacific rockfish with sauteed shrimp and my husband had mesquite broiled rainbow trout. Both dishes came with vegetables and long branch potatoes - basically big chips.Both pieces of fish were excellent, it's such a pity that the vegetables were bland and the chips not very good. Even so, it is well worth a visit for a fun night

We cannot say enough good things about the food, service or atmosphere. My wife did not want to sit at the bar at first, now that is the only spot she wants to sit, you get to see other orders as they go by which helps you decide what you want and staff is entertaining. We started with the crab cakes which we have had from coast to coast and I will say the are the best we have ever had. Not a place to go if you want want quiet and slow service and waiters, but if you are an A game player you will love this place.

Do you want to experience REAL San Francisco? A restaurant populated by locals from the grey beards of the Financial District and law to the dynamic youth of Silicon Valley, Tadich Grill is the restaurant and bar to savor the real San Francisco.The waiters have been there for generations. The menu is broad, primarily fish and incredibly fresh, excellently prepared and served with San Francisco french bread that you will remember. The ambiance is pure traditional San Francisco. No nonsense, not catering to tourists or trends, but excellent food served by waiters who will remember you, talk with you and tell you what they think is best on the menu. Remember when service was great and an art. The waiters at Tadich Grill do.Excellent food, excellent service with a touch of what restaurants used to be.

For an exceedingly over the top meal, go to the Tadich Grill, a mainline SF institution. Having never been before, I was treated to a lovely meal after going to the Legion of Honor to see an exhibition. My SF friends said, this is the place and it was. It is SF's oldest continuous restaurant (since the mid 1800s) and there is mural upstairs tracing that history. The poached halibut in a ginger soy broth was delightful. Oh and did I mention that the fried calamari appetizer was to die for, a combination of baby squid and mature squid rondelles. Perfectly fried, not greasy and delightfully tender. The vegetables (broccoli, carrots, and onions) that accompanied the wild Alaskan Halibut were perfectly steamed, not soggy but nicely firm. For dessert add in the most luscious cheese cake (5 inch tall slice) I have tasted in a long time drizzled with raspberry syrup (light and extremely tasty). A perfect meal and the best I have had in a while. Treat yourself, you will not be disappointed.

Believed to be the third oldest restaurant in America, there's a reason that Tadich Grill has withstood the test of time. The best seafood in San Francisco, outstanding old-world service, and a vibrant historic dining atmosphere. I believe I had my first meal at Tadich nearly 40 years ago. And, while I moved away from San Francisco 5 years ago, I still make sure I visit every time I'm in the Bay Area. The staff is fantastic and somehow always manages to remember me! The menu is extensive and I have my favorites. Best clam chowder anywhere. Fresh shucked oysters are always terrific as are the Pacific Oysters Rockefeller. San Dabs are fantastic and, when on the menu, the Chilean Sea Bass is incredible. Prices are amazing too. They could charge much more. I tell everyone that Tadich Grill is a must experience restaurant when visiting San Francisco. It's great to see that it continues to draw crowds!

I have three dining musts on Bay Area visits; Hog Island Oyster Co. (the mother ship), Yank Sing and Tadich. No visit is complete without a return to Tadich Grill. It's atmosphere for sure plus dependable seafood. I think the only thing I've ever ordered are the Sand Dabs which were, as usual, excellent accompanied by Long Branch Potatoes and a medley of fresh vegetables. Spouse had an enormous Shrimp Louie Salad and rated it excellent as well. The menu changes daily to reflect fresh seafood availability. We had a table this time but I actually prefer dining at the bar.

During a recent stay at the Loews Regency across the street, we carried out dinner from this incredible restaurant twice and took it back to our room. This historic restaurant deserves the accolades it has received. Delicious food, prompt and professional service, and an atmosphere right out of a movie set. Just don't expect to order your food for pick up over the phone, I tried it twice and both times they told me they were too busy for a phone order. I was instructed to walk in and place the order at the far end of the bar near the kitchen. Not as convenient as I would have liked but well worth the trouble of waiting !

My wife and I had a great evening here at the Tadich . We showed up about 745 on a Wed nite expecting long wait however it was only about 20 mins .We enjoyed a drink at the bar . It is unique place as the long bar area in the middle dominated the room . About 2/3 of bar area is dedicated ( 1st come 1st serve ) for people wanting food and this speeds up the whole process . We opted for a table for 2 and although place was crowded and lively we seemed to have plenty of room . Service was excellent we had one of the very few female servers and she was great ! We hate being rushed when out to eat and the pace here was perfect . Started with Calamari , best I have ever had and could have fed a table of 4 easy , food was excellent also as I had swordfish and my wife had scallops . Wine list reasonably priced like menu overall a great experience at SF's oldest eating establishment . !!

When I arrived the place was extremely busy and noisy. A member of staff asked for my name and number of persons and then asked me to wait outside (with the crowd of people) and they would then call my name. Alternatively, I could wait inside and take a seat at the bar once available, i.e. first come, first served. As there were only two of us, we decided to sit at the bar, towards the rear of restaurant and didn't have to wait long for a seat. The added advantage of sitting towards the rear, is that it is quieter.The member of staff who took care of us at the bar, was extremely friendly and gave some great advice on the food ... I chose the Seafood Cioppino, which was delicious and I would certainly have this again.I will certainly go to this restaurant/bar again, when I'm next in town.

The service was fantastic. They don't take reservations and it was very crowded so we did have to wait at the bar for a little while. But the environment was so much fun we didn't mind. My only issue was that the food was not all I had hoped it would be. We ordered classics: lobster Thermidor and the crabcakes. I didn't love them. That said now I can say that I've had classic lobster Thermidor and crabcakes at the Tadich Grill.

We were recommended this place by friends back home in Florida. So glad we came! We were warned that seating would be difficult, but we were seated right away at the bar for lunch (12:30). We ordered our favorite cocktail (Hey--We're on vacation!), and the Vesper was icy cold & delicious-- a tad too much Lillet, but that was remedied on the next round!We had a leisurely lunch, sharing a Dungenous crab cake (full of sweet, lump crabmeat, very little filler if any) & Oysters Rockefeller (more like oysters Fluorentine, but delicious nonetheless). They brought the dishes one after the other in series so as to let us enjoy each delicious bite & take a breather in between. We threw caution to the winds & decided to share a final entree (we were going out to a birthday dinner at The House of Prime Rib in 4 hours!) & ordered the pan-fried Pelante Sole - melted like butter in my mouth! The vegetables were flavorful & firm. Thomas, our waiter flew about like a whirlwind at the crowded bar, but managed to be attentive to us. We never felt rushed, although the place was packed. We had a nice conversation when the crowd died down. All in all, a very satisfying lunch, and we'll be back!

Tadich Grill is a longstanding, old-style grill that has not succumbed to the need to be chic and is all the better for it. It maintains its old-world charm, longtime professional waiters, tile floors, wood panels and semi-private table areas, counter, and no reservations policy - you line up at the door. Mainly seafood, and plenty of it, you can select how you want your fish cooked - and there are plenty of other options if you're not a fish lover (but then, why go there?). Chowder, salads, sides (creamed spinach!) - the food is plentiful and tasty. It's always busy at Tadich, and you can linger over lunch or dinner. A classic San Francisco institution - beloved by locals and a must-dine for visitors.

We visited as a group of 5 on a family holiday and had a fabulous experience. The ambience of the restaurant is 100% genuine , the food was excellent and the service was diligent and characterful. Not cheap but to dine at a San Francisco classic was well worth the little extra. We sat at the bar to eat which was great but I'd advise you to request a table if you want to have a more leisurely dining experience. I don't believe they take reservations - we had a late lunch and don't have any delays.

Satisfaction and great food

The oldest restaurant in San Francisco is also one of the best. We enjoyed a shrimp and crab dinner salad and rockfish along with good wine and a great Long Island Ice Tea. The food was excellent, service was prompt but the noise level almost made conversation impossible.

We loved this restaurant! Great service and food. Loved the sourdough bread and ciopinno! Seated quickly without reservations can sit at bar as well which is fun to watch waiters mix drinks, busy place. Love that people have worked there for years!

The Tadich is a very old bar and grill fixture in SF. We had been there a few years ago and really remembered the great atmosphere of the place. There are mostly older men working as waiters (older than 30!). They were quite attentive, though sitting at the bar gave us access to lots of people and conversation. We ordered a Trumer Pils, a Drake's Hefeweizen, and split a crab salad. All of it was great, making for a light lunch in a wonderful establishment. Check it out on California Street towards the Ferry Building. We;ve been impressed twice now.

Excellent in every way

We have dined here twice and both times have been beyond impressed. A restaurant doesn't get to be the oldest in SFO without being extraordinary. It gets packed in here but you will get acknowledged the second you walk through the door. Our server gave great recommendations and we devoured our meals, sand dabs and cioppino. Had a few glasses of wine, a few beers, carrot cake for dessert, seriously amazing. Definitely go here. We'll be back!

We came here for dinner in San Francisco. The seafood was delicious and prepared perfectly. However, the service needs some help. The waiters are in a rush and aren't very friendly. But the food was good.

Tried to get into another restaurant in SF area, but they closed at 6:00. Staff recommended walk to Tadich Grill. Arrived around 6:00 pm on Thursday evening, and had to wait about 15 minutes for table. Small venue, but many bar stools on one side of restaurant. Other side has the tables and booths. Wish we had gotten a booth for privacy and not along the aisle, but we were given a table. Waiter was professional, but not overly friendly. Food was excellent and timely. Sour dough bread was outstanding. Would return to this restaurant if I'm ever in this area again.

Loved this place as soon as we walked in. Old world at its finest! From the cocktails at the bar, the white-coated waiters, the amazing cioppino, we just loved this place. The sour dough bread here is a food group unto itself. Not to be missed!!

Based on its history and the suggestion of a friend, went for the cioppino. It was outstanding, chock full of seafood in a delicious tomato base. All the seafood was very fresh, well prepared and the atmosphere was old school fish house. Way more atmosphere than fisherman's wharf. If you are alone, there is always a seat at the bar for a meal. The booths are nice for 4-6 and there are many small tables for couples too. The full bar makes old time cocktails and the wine list is reasonable and features California wines primarily. Well worth a visit on EVERY trip to SF.

Quintessential San Francisco. Over 20 plus years I have successfully tried every dish at this amazing neighborhood eatery. The staff is professional, efficient, non-intrusive and even friendly - provided you have thick skin (local inside joke).The feel and vibe here is just something you have to experience. Try the counter for something different. I wish I could give 6 stars for this darling of San Francisco dining.

As everyone likely knows by now, Tadich Grill is the oldest restaurant in California and the third oldest in the United States. In our view, that alone is ample reason to dine there. It's a reasonable assumption that any dining establishment that old must be doing everything very well! My wife and I knew about their famous Seafood Cioppino, but the Dungeness Crab and Prawns a la Monza was an incredible and wonderful discovery. Our Tadich Grill experience was extraordinary in every respect.

One of San Francisco's Best!

The Tadich Grill is an institution in San Francisco. Be sure to make a reservation and get there early to secure a curtained-privacy booth. Service is excellent, despite the fast pace the servers keep in order to give all their guests the best service. Take a look at their website to check out the menu. And if you are particular about your cocktails, have no reservations about getting the best that mixologists can offer.

We visited as a family and was very happy with the choice. I had Chilean Sea Bass, one of the best I ever had, loved it. My son had Swordfish, hands down the best Swordfish we tasted and my wife had the Seafood Chipino. It also lived up to the recommendations as the best thing on the menu from our waiter. 

Still the best seafood in SF

Haven't been here in years, and was a little concerned about the possible wait time, as well as whether or not it was still good after all these years. Not to worry! Arrived facing a line of people waiting, but apparently they were all couples, so the 4 of us were immediately greeted and seated by an older version of a friendly Ted Danson look alike. Water and great sourdough bread appeared within minutes, followed by the most friendly and skillful waiter--so sorry we didn't get his name-- what a gem. We devoured generous servings of crab cocktails, followed by delicious Branzino with potatoes and vegetables, along with a Macrostie Chardonnay. We all finished our food despite the generous portions.

The Tadich Grill was highly recommended to us by a worldly, traveler friend, so we came for supper on our first night in town. We were seated immediately. (That wouldn't have happened if we came 20 minutes later.) As promised, the food was excellent, but the service was even better! Our waiter was an absolute delight. If that wasn't enough, the ambiance was equally enjoyable.

Best seafood cioppino ever!

The dinning room is not that fancy. It is crowdy almost all of the time - book a table in advance. Waiters shout waiting list names all the time, increasing noise. But is still worthy! The seafood cioppino was fantastic. The steak was also really good. Respectable desserts - Bourbon pudding is the choice. A must-go in SF Bay area.

We had a wonderful dinner here. Sure, some of the waiters can be a bit surly and the prices are maybe a bit on the high side...but that's just part of the SF foodie experience. They don't take reservations, and apparently the wait can be long. We went very early on a Friday (5:00 pm) and were seated immediately. I would've given 5 stars, but the wine I ordered wasn't so hot. The cioppino made up for that, though, it was excellent.

No reservations but worth the wait!

This is the oldest restaurant in SF and it's no surprise that it has lasted this long. It's not just great food, it's a great experience! Walk in, give your name to the host and hang out till your table is called. We waited and were able to score seats at the awesome, super long bar and have a drink till our table was called. We had a fantastic time watching the bartenders work-they were hustling the entire time! The bartender was really fun to talk to, as well. Every employee we encountered was amazing even though the place was packed! We ordered oysters on the half shell and the famous seafood ciopinni (so??). It was fabulous! This is a must!

The location of Tadich Grill is perfect, very close to Market St Embarcadero, and considering that this is probably one of the oldest establishments in SF, they have maintained that feeling of old time service we have been missing in so many other restaurants. It is a fun place with good food and wine. The perfect spot for a nice lunch or dinner. Try their grilled fish, you cannot go wrong with any of their fresh seafood offerings. I like sitting at the bar myself because I prefer lunch there than dinner. Highly recommended.

Freedom! We are out without the kids for the first time in 5 long days of a 26 day road trip. I don't know how we are going to make it the remaining 21 days, but having a night out at Tadich has given us hope that we are gonna make it. The atmosphere although loud, was so energetic and relaxing at the same time you couldn't help but feel 15 years younger. Classic drinks without umbrellas or awkwardly shaped glassware was like finding a small bit of sanity in this backwards world. The food comes out fast despite the constant flow of people pouring in. If the sourdough bread they bring to your table before ordering isn't any indication that you are in for an amazing meal then order the Oyster Rockefeller and you'll realize these people have mastered the art of true hospitality. 

Tasty!

This is maybe the oldest restaurant in San Francisco and pretty iconic. Nothing showy or fancy, but what a sense of history. Every big city has one and this one you need to visit. Big long counter for lunch or dinner and a number of booths if you are feeling a bit more formal. Excellent food, excellent staff, and memorable dining experience. First time I went was close to 50 years ago and it's still a treat.No reservations taken.

What a delightful place! We found this gem on TripAdvisor and decided to try it at lunch. From the bartender who greeted and seated us to the fun waitstaff and the chef who accommodated lots of food allergies-the service was superb but not a bit stuffy. And the food was amazing. We split an Ahi Tuna salad first then split the sea bass as our entree. I sipped up the sauce from the sea bass with the delicious sourdough bread. Then when asked a sever about directions he actually walked us outside to point the way. Highly recommend!!!!

I wish I had known about this place sooner on our trip to San Francisco, because I would love to to back there. I researched restaurants while cruising around SF and came across Tadich Grill, started reading reviews and said to my husband, I want to go there! As soon as we went inside, I just felt like this was going to be a special place and boy, was I right! Where to start? The restaurant has an old-timey feeling, which I liked and we didn't have to wait very long for seats to open up at the bar. Waiters were friendly and served us quickly. Had the best martini(s) ever...and filled to the rim. We shared a prawn cocktail & crab cocktail...which were amazing. For entree, I had sauteed scallops (cooked perfectly) with a delicious sauce and mixed vegetables. For dessert, we had cappuccinos and an apple pie dessert. Overall, it was my favorite dining experience in San Francisco and will highly recommend to anyone.

This is the go to place in the Financial District for seafood and taking in their history since 1849. Went with a group of six on a Tuesday night and waited at the enormous bar for almost an hour, which was a great experience for people watching and the Moscow Mules. Our group split between their signature dish Ciopinno stew ($33) and the broiled halibut. The stew is a must for any first time visitor. The halibut was excellent. Service here is traditionally impeccable. The large portions with fresh vegetables had us skipping a ride back to the hotel and walking to Market street.

All as promised. Great drinks, great food and great service. The Tadich Grill lives up to its reputation 100%. After several visits to San Francisco finally had an opportunity to tuck into the Tadich Grill for drinks and dinner. A great Sazerac, excellent clam chowder, superb fried Petrale sole and bread pudding. Could not ask for more. Both the waiter and the bartender provided the old-time vibe. Arrive early to avoid waiting in line and try mid-week. You'll enjoy it.

We have deep roots in San Francisco I'd well over 40 years. . My wife lived in SF. We spend a lot of time in San Francisco and would spend more if we could.My wife and I go bacK with Tadich to the 70s - and it is one of those place that manages not to get old. The bar is excellent, the food is terrific and the service attentive. The worst thing I could say is that we tried to eat there without a reservation on an evening when it was full. We came back. The dining room is pleasant and well served. The menu is filled with old favorites and the specials. The wait staff is professional and reliable in recommendations. FWIW, I wandered into the kitchen and found it in harmony for a bustling. (I wouldn't suggest doing that). The ciappino is excelkent as always. Tadich is like coming home. So it is. Great bar.
