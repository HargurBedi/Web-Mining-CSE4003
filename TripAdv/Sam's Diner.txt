Slow service. Hostes sat at her station eating breakfast. ..There were 2 orders of bacon. Both ordered extra crispy, both came out like soggy Canadian bacon. Also they ran out of Bloody Mary mix on a Sunday morning- AND there was a bartender ? Quick meal on the run might be good choice.

Old fashioned in a good way. Service was excellent without being to overpowering. the waiter looked like he was wearing his bigger brothers suit but was very attentive. lots of choice on the menu which was all cooked fresh. I had veal which was very tasty and tender. Good experience without costing the earth.

My husband, teenaged grandson, and I stopped at Sam's for lunch prior to a 2:00 pm performance at the Opera House. Two things influenced our choice: location (not a lot of restaurants to choose from on Sunday afternoon that are close to the Opera House) and a 4.2 rating on TripAdvisor. All of us were disappointed with the food and service. The vegetarian burrito had too much rice and very little cheese, salsa, chile verde, etc. The server was indifferent and my grandson never did get any ketchup for his fries. The automatically added gratuity irritated me. We won't be returning.

We arrived mid afternoon on Sunday, one table occupied, and we were told to grab any table we'd like. Then we waited literally five minutes before someone else brought us a menu. Seriously? The food was good: grilled chicken with caramelized onions on rye with Swiss, fries on the side. It's clean, it's nice, it's good. It's somewhere between average and very good. It's convenient and our server was attentive.

Great Choice - Close to Theaters

Sam's is a great choice for a pre-theater meal if you have evening tickets or a post-show meal if you have matinee tickets. The portions are good and the prices are reasonable. The service is good and efficient as they are used to people needing to get in an out and on to the show. It is also one of the few places that serves breakfast down in this area. They usually have a few selections on a separate menu that are "themed" to whatever show if playing. They do take reservations on for times that are close to the start of the shows, but they won't hold them for more than a few minute because of the line that forms. They also have service at the bar if all of the tables are full, but those fill quickly as well. We will definitely be going back.

Great Classic Diner
Rating: 5
Date: August 26, 2017
In a city know for it's classic diners, Sam's may be one of the best. It's located on a somewhat scruffy block of Market Street, but not far from theaters, Civic Center, Symphony Hall and the Opera House.It's a busy, crowded place, traditional diner in style, but we were seated pretty quickly, a relief because we had an older, mobility impaired friend with us. Service was efficient and courteous, although the busy-ness of the room clearly did not allow much time for hanging out exchanging pleasantries. Our friend had a Shrimp Louie salad which he enjoyed, and which appeared to have plenty of shrimp. My wife said her BLT as excellent, with nice, thick slab-style bacon. I had a classic cheeseburger which was very tasty and juicy, and came with a nice array of lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles, set on the side so you can arrange it all as you wish. A little more than you might typically expect to pay fro a burger, but it's a very good burger, and it is San Francisco.

We went to this place while staying at the Holiday Inn civic center around the corner and found it a convenient, very family type diner with really good breakfasts options like omelets, pancakes and hash browns, the eggs benedict (florentine) are great also. But what I really like about the place is the service, everyone seems to know you after a while. Brunch options are equally good and varied, if you like chilaquiles or tacos, or if you love Hawaiian (like I do) the mahalo loco moco are great alternatives. They do a really nice job making you feel at home.

I stay at the hotel across the road and this restaurant is our base camp for some time now. I can say they are consistent with the quality and service. This year it looks like they made some changes which are not as nice. The decor is slightly different ( more modern ), tables and chairs. Also I think the place has been painted a little bit. Overall, it doesn't feel homey anymore, more formal, but still ok. Food quality still very good but the prices went up. I have a feeling that the direction is to make this place look more upscale which is not really working, especially in this ( terrible ) part of Market street. But so far still acceptable place to eat and drink local beer. Please just don't overdo the changes next time...

We dragged ourselves to Sam's once we had checked in to our Air BnB after traveling for 8+ hours. We were very hungry as all we had to eat were home made peanut butter and jam sandwiches on the plane. The service at Sam's was very friendly and attentive. The food was very fresh and the beers sure hit the spot. Great place for a diner meal with a good on tap beer. Also,, the place was practically spotless.

Some places think breakfast is eggs. Some places add French toast for variety. Sam's Diner has -- wait for it -- bacon-stuffed pancakes. What!! Chilaquiles. Loco moco. They're not messing around, and they serve it until 3 pm in the afternoon so there's no excuse. Try their omelets, which besides the usual includes Korean beef and kimchi, or the two-egg breakfast, where the protein of choice includes a chorizo patty or country fried steak or corned beef hash. Try the eggs benedict. Just know that they have more variety than the average diner and that the bacon-stuffed pancakes, the corned beef hash, and the loco moco (yes, I've tried them all) are straight-up great. The hash browns are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The servers are nice enough to start a new pot of decaf if you ask, and check in to make sure everything's okay.

Beware: You're Paying For A Gimmick

You're not paying for the food. You're paying for the gimmick. Beware. We gave Sam's two try's. Dinner and breakfast. Both were pretty awful, but this is about our breakfast experience.No service for over five minutes. Waiter #1 came to us as an after thought, took the coffee order and vanished for over ten minutes. In that time, we saw him distribute coffee to other tables, so we asked a Waitress if we could have some coffee.Waiter #1 returns with coffee after we have been served coffee by the waitress, and he becomes upset with us? A line of excuses for why he hadn't brought us coffee including that it was brewing. Yet, we'd seen him giving coffee to several customers.Service is atrocious. The gentlemen who ended up being our waiter, Waiter #2, had zero interest to give in us. Zero. He was phoning it in 100 percent and not well.Food:Velveeta or similar cheese in omelette. Clumped in. Meals were under cooked and flavor was lackluster.No check in from the staff about what we needed.No ketchup. No coffee refill.The nicest elderly couple beside us. They asked us for cream for their coffee because the service was so bad. The gentleman in the couple had to send his meal back because it was prepared incorrectly. The patiently sat, as we did with our own service issues, but It was over ten minutes before the meal returned.They ended up having to ask us for ketchup and pepper because their server neglected their needs.Sat fifteen minutes after our meal when we finally were offered coffee by wait staff number four. At this point, we asked to see the manager. The female manager was compassionate and listened to our concerns. For the price point, you expect the food to be delicious and the staff to have some interest in service. In the end, we were comped the meal. While that was a generous offer, that wasn't the point in alerting the manager. You come to a place like Sam's with signed musical theater posters for a diner experience. A big part of that experience is caring about the food that goes out of the kitchen and the staff that serves the customers. They weren't particularly slammed with customers, so it really felt like some message from the top down was absent. Without the glam, you can go to Local Diner a few feet down the street. Yeah, you won't have signed musical posters on the wall, but you'll have exceptional service and a delicious meal at a lower price point. For me, that counts for something.

It's so great to have a clean place to eat close to the Orpheum. Sam's has been renovated since we were there last... new booths, new bathrooms, walls recovered. Looks much more upscale but basically, it's still Sams. My husband and I had our favorite although the price has gone up a bit. 1/2 fried chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. Comes with a choice of soup or salad. We also got glasses of wine. Our friends got a French dip and the other scallop risotto. They give 10% off if you show theater tickets. This time, we had a waiter who was not very good and I didn't get my salad when others got their soup and my salad had th wrong dressing. The very best thing about Sam's is that once you walk out the door, you are about 3 minutes walk to the Orpheum!

First, this place has a way overblown reputation. We had cobb salads for lunch. They were ok but nothing special. Overpriced but I don't mind paying more for a really good salad in an expensive city. Now for the snotty attitude. Starting at 10 am, we waited for an hour for the promise of a "table." At 11 we were seated at a low 2-seat side by side section of the bar way towards the end (bathroom end). Its very loud at the bar with the expresso machine, dishes, etc. I think its because we are elderly women and just don't count for fulfilling promises. My advice is - eat somewhere else or if you have to go here, make an advance reservation. Then they rushed us out and didn't refill our water glasses.

We had dinner here before attending the show "Hamilton" at the Orpheum. Being near the theater, the service was quick, yet not rushed. The helpings were generous, yet did not make you feel bloated to attend the theater. The diner has fun offering a selection in a "Hamilton" theme.The Scallop Risotto was cooked perfectly. Save room for dessert - the Warm Whisky Apple Spice cake is delicious.While none of our party selected the Crab Melt, the table next to us did - and the aroma was tantalizing.

It was a cloudy Sunday morning, and I was walking to the San Francisco Main Library. Sam's Diner is only half a block from the library. I didn't have to be at the Latin Community Room to help out until 11:30 am. And, it was 10:45 am, thinking I should have breakfast, since it will be a long Sunday.Its been a while since I visited Sam's diner. They remodeled the place with new dining furniture. Staff were busy as were the open kitchen cooking staff too.I walked into the restaurant and it was jam packed! I forgot that many people were down this Civic Center area for the finish of the San Francisco marathon this whole morning. So I asked the hostess if there's any seat at the counter, I promptly sat at the counter. Checked out the menu and asked for the classic breakfast * 2 eggs, bread, 3 bacons, hash brown. For beverage , I asked for water. Coffee is $2.75 .It took them a while before my order. It was about 20 minutes. It took me ten minutes to finish my breakfast and walked across the street to the Main Library.The bill was reasonable for a classic breakfast! And, the cooking was very good. Server was fair and the place was busy.

Went here twice - once for dinner to celebrate a birthday and the second for a beer and lunch on the deck. Both superb. First trip we had Tuna poke, smoked trout salad and Dungeness crab for starter (trout particularly good), followed by Rock cod, tuna and x2 shrimp pasta. Sadly the pasta was inedibly salty but the waiter took it away and brought back fresh plates. Obviously freshly cooked because they came 15 minutes after we'd finished our mains. They brought a complimentary slice of cake for my husbands birthday. So impressed we came back for calamari and crab cakes on the deck, washed down with beer and cider. Perfect way to pass the afternoon in the sun, on the deck in the sun. This place is obviously well known locally. Would definitely recommend.

We were looking for a cafe before a matinee performance at the Orpheum Theater. Just a half block away on the same side of Market Street as the theater and near the corner of Hyde Street, we spotted Sam's Diner. The menu is a sampling of Japanese, American, Mexican, and Korean appetizers and entrees. I ordered a toasted grilled cheese and ham sandwich on sourdough. It came with a side of coleslaw, the best I've had in a long time, young, fresh and flavorsome - perfect with the ham and cheese. My friend had a delicious golden beet salad with a few other other salad ingredients. Good service, courteous and friendly staff, nice and comfortable booths and tables. There is a dinner menu and wine list, too, if you come later in the day.

I saw a woman at the next table who had ordered a breakfast sandwich that looked pretty awesome and was served with tater tots. I ordered the sandwich and was presently surprised. Service was good and breakfast was great other than something nasty in my husbands coffee (it looks like a big snot clump) and when showed to the staff they quickly took it away and brought us a new cup of coffee and didn't charge us for the coffee. We didn't expect that but was appreciated. We would definitely come back and was going to go back the next morning but we had to head out of the city to go back home.

Sam's is a pleasant oasis on the hurly-burly of Market Street. It claims to be "home to the legendary Korean taco". A clean casual space, with posters from Broadway shows on the walls. Friendly service, decent prices. On the negative side. Sticky silverware & wet table. The coffee was bitter. My pancakes, sausages and my pal's hash-browns were under-cooked.I'd give Sam's another try, maybe for those Korean tacos.

Excellent value! Fabulous choices! Staff Lovely!

This is a great place for wholesome food and plenty of it! Most people we noticed were taking home leftovers! Great hamburgers. Food fresh. Shannon looked after us and was very friendly, yet efficient-watching the queue at the door and trying to find them room (always a good sign, when locals are prepared to wait!). I had a fruit salad bowl to take-out and it was the best value in all of Western USA Tour I tasted). Everyone appeared happy with their purchase. Thank You Sam's Diner! Great place for a pre-dinner before the theatre, which is just up the street! ENJOY! 

Try the Farmers Market breakfast!

We stayed across the street and were so grateful to have Sam's so close by. Awesome staff, great food and beers. We ate several meals at Sam's during our stay and had a great experience each time.

Good, honest American diner.....with great staff

It was our first trip to SF (from the United Kingdom); we were staying at the hotel across Market and on our first night were tired from travelling so didn't want to go too far. Well, this place really is a little gem! The choice of food is varied but well prepared and overall the prices are pretty reasonable. But mainly the staff were truly lovely (we went two more times, once at lunch and again one evening).

Truly delicious

We came here whilst on holiday in San Francisco and found Sam's Diner completely by accident. We'd actually been looking for somewhere else but when we got there it was closed, so we looked around for somewhere and found Sam's. Service was polite and prompt. Portion sizes are huge - you will not go hungry here.Bacon & eggs were top-notch and the pancakes were perfect. I also have to mention the tater tots (my first experience of this US staple) as they were really really good. Overall, it's well-priced, tasty and was a great start to a good day. Well done.

Great meal

Wow just wow. My husband had read up on this diner before we had gone as it was straight across from our hotel. From the outside it looks but like a motorway burger van but I thought well give it get your hubby's got good food taste. I am soooooo pleased I did. We ate twice there and it was lovely. The food, the servers and the atmosphere. Quickly seated, food came quick and tasted amazing. Burgers juicy, steaks massive and my husband had meatloaf and wanted seconds!! Meals are huge be warned!! A price of a meal was very reasonable.

Lovely breakfast, no pancakes!

We went here one morning after seeing good reviews on trip advisor and we were really looking forward to an American diner breakfast. The food was lovely and the staff were friendly, however, we were disappointed to learnt there was no pancakes on the menu! Great American food!

This Place Is Amazing !

My husband and I were visiting San Francisco from the UK and because we always prefer value for money, we found Sams from TripAdvisor . I have to say that this restaurant is one of the best eateries I have ever visited in terms of quality of the food and customer service!There are absolutely no frills but the staff are extremely attentive and make sure that everything is OK. When we got there, there was a queue of people waiting for a table outside about 2 hours which even suggests that the place is extremely popular. As it was my 50th birthday two days before, I had sent then an email to try to book a table but I had a prompt reply stating their opening times and bookings are only taken for parties of at least 5 people. My husband and I had the build your own burger which was so delicious and the bill was less than $50. (One glass of beer and wine included )

We had dinner at Sam's before an evening show at the nearby Orpheum Theater. We arrived at 6:15 on a weekday and were seated right away. We had a good meal with fast and friendly service and were out in plenty of time for the 8:00 performance. We had Korean tacos with rice, fish and chips, a beer, and peach cobbler with ice cream. The tacos and chips were just right. My fish was mushy with too-hard batter. Great value meal for San Francisco.

Fun vibe, great burgers, good pricing. It's a bit of a challenge to find a place that is not crowded, not overpriced, and convenient to the theater or, in our case, Davies Symphony Hall. Sam's was the perfect spot to get a bite to eat before our concert. Check it out.

Perfect for theater-goers

How could you not be enticed by a menu cleverly reflecting the Orpheum's productions? And only a block from the theater, so no stress about arriving late to the performance; Sam's charming servers are very aware of curtain time. Food arrived promptly and was delicious. I highly recommend the Korean tacos, but there are many diner comfort foods from which to choose. My only concern is the restroom which was eerily reminiscent of an old locked bathroom located behind a sketchy gas station. Unless that was the intended theme, it needs a major overhaul.

Good Food, efficient helpful staff

We had dinner here before going to the Orpheum theatre (just a block away). This really is a great diner. The new 'loaded tater tots' are really good - we had the Bulgogi Korean style version. I could make a dinner out of these with a salad. I also had the paper steak special which was pretty good and cooked to my specification. Surprisingly for a diner, they did a great job of timing the various dishes that we ordered (which we also noticed was true at the tables around us so it wasn't accidental). We were guessing that they sometimes host cast parties since they have a great selection of show posters that are signed by the cast.

Low key, but $3 good beer. The food is pretty good, but do for a full lunch or dinner. The appetizers are overpriced I think. Nice service. Giants on TV.

I stayed in the hotel across the street and found myself having breakfast in this diner 3 days in a row. The coffee was good and the hash brown crispy. I like my eggs sunny side up and they were perfect. I did not care for the other sides. I tried their bacon once and the sausages once but nothing special.

Fast and Yummy
