We were in San Francisco for a wedding but had a free night. We just started looking for a place to dine a week before and found it extremely difficult to book anything. We were really lucky we were able to get into Perbacco, at 8:15. Most of the other places would have been after 8:30 or 9:00. So, make sure you give yourself lots of lead time. Perbacco definitely lived up to its reviews. It is a fun, upscale and lively restaurant with a great menu and a wine list so extensive, as to be almost overwhelming. The service was outstanding! My wife and daughter had pasta and I had the pork chop. All the dishes were excellent but we found them all to be a little rich.Despite that, I would not hesitate to return to Perbacco but I might ask them to lay off the sauce.

We agree with other reviewers. The high ratings are well deserved. For us, the details made all the difference. I was wearing a dark outfit and the waitress asked if I wanted a black napkin instead of the white one at the table. THAT's the kind of service you get here. It was quiet enough to talk and we were never interrupted by invasive service. The food was also comforting and fancy all at the same time. You won't be disappointed.

It's a little funky for my idea of northern Italian. I would also order insalata mista or some soup, but they don't offer anything like that. I'm too pedestrian maybe. I would say they're leaving money on the table. I had scallops and they were very good. Only four of them for $34, so not a great value but the execution and sauce were very good. I get the dessert menu: 20 kinds of grappa. OK, now we're talking authentic Italian. I also had dessert which was good. Pomegranate flavor. The service was excellent. It is Oracle week and all of downtown was busy--but this place has enough staff to handle it.

We had no reservation and the place was crowded but the staff seated us and the service was great. There were 4 of us and all had something different from pasta to scallops. We all loved the food. The menu is complete and is somewhat imaginative. What is not there is veal parm, but I guess you can't have everything.The service was attentive without being intrusive, and the experience was terrific.I will certainly go back.

After a hectic day of air travel, our dinner reservations at Perbacco opened up a great weekend in San Francisco. The staff were attentive, made excellent recommendations for wine and food. The atmosphere was sophisticated but comfortable. Risotto was so delicious, as were our main courses of scallops, pasta with ragu and a stuffed pasta. Our desserts were amazing as well. This meal was worth every penny. Highly recommend and we will visit again.

White linens and great wait-staff are what first greets you. The Sommelier is there to recommend a wine, and her choice for us was a delicious Barolo. My wife and I aren't huge eaters so we shared a pasta to start, quail folded into pasta pillows - absolutely wonderful flavors. We enjoyed braised beef cheeks for the main course, cooked perfectly on a bed of polenta. It was a marvelous dinner with great service and better food.!

Group of 6 dined on a Thursday night. Ordered 3 courses, high range wines and coffees. At 11:30 we were told that they were closing up and by 11:45 we were told that it was our second warning and that we needed to leave immediately. It was very embarrassing as we were hosting our leadership team. We also work in the customer service industry and would never have treated any guests like that. Other than that the food was very good. Fresh ingredients and nice size servings. Sauces were very tasty and pasta cooked beautifully. The sommelier also was very knowledgable and recommended a great Barolo. Too bad about the rude ending.

We've eaten at Perbacco,once or twice a year while in San Francisco md return to enjoy the outstanding food and the elegant atmosphere. We find the experience solid from entry to bar to table in any orde. Service is outstanding and very smooth. The restaurant is expansive with quiter nooks and a few where the sound level is higher. It depends on the crowd. The difficulty is sorting through a deep menu with a nemory of past meals serving as a tug to one dish or another. My choices vary - if the dish discription appeals to me, it usually is in fact. Early in the meal, I like the Pesce Crudo, the roasted beet salad, and move on to other stages. I enjoyed the Spaghetti Nero most recently. If White truffles are in hand, they make a splendid addition to other pasta courses. For main courses the Flatron Steak was perfectly cooked and tasty. I tend to eat more fish than when I was younger and Perbacco is never a letdown. Scallops we reliably cooked to a tee. Typically, cheese or dessert is a hard choice. The cheeses are splendid - the deserts a treat. We've likeboth.

My daughter and I ate at Perbacco on the last night of our trip to San Francisco; we wanted to eat somewhere special for our final meal. We booked online and were glad we did, as it was very busy.We ate in the downstairs section which was certainly buzzing. The tables were a little too close, which meant that noise from other diners was quite intrusive.The food was excellent, washed down with an excellent (if expensive) zinfandel.The service was OK, if perhaps a little formal.The cost was on the pricey side at over $200 for 2, although the wine took a chunk of that.

High quality Italian food. From the appetizers to the pasta all really well done. Starting with the carne cruda, pesce crudo, and salad very tasty, although the carne could have used a tad more salt. The pasta - the gnocchi were soft pillows of pasta expertly executed, the short rib ragu a savory delight, and the agnolotti were divine. Don't miss dessert.

We dined early on a Saturday evening. We found Charles a charming and gracious Maitre 'D. A nice slick contemporary ambience. Every single plate was so very good. For starters, Vitello Tonnato, Burrata salad, the veal tartare. My Tuna with cucumber and Nasturtium was a knockout... never tasted anything like it before.... amazingly good! All the mains were standouts too-- scallops, quail, halibut and my Langaroli- fresh pasta with shortrib ragout and black truffle..yummm!Sadly we had to leave to get the last ferry back to Larkspur so couldn't indulge ourselves with the desserts.... next time!!!!

I had an excellent late lunch ( 1.30 p.m. reservation ) here a little over a month ago and as I was making a reservation today to eat there again next week, I thought I should praise how enjoyable a dining experience it is to go there.The dining room, towards the back , beyond the bar, is modern but stylish and the comfortable elegance, warm finishes, natural woods, good subdued lighting,crisp white table cloths, all contribute to the overall elegant charm of the space.Service is attentive, friendly and efficient. The food is delicious and handsomely presented on the plate. The bread and oil very good also.The first courses have some interesting and subtly delicious taste combinations.The pasta is first rate and the desserts are suitably decadent and very tasty.Most importantly, for a business lunch you can actually easily hear the conversation of your companions without any strain.Overall it is just a very delicious enjoyable quietly elegant dining experience

These were cooked to perfection. They were served with cauliflower. I would suggest a group, and I would return myself.

An expensive authentic Italian food with a flair. For the five us our bill totaled $330.00 which did include a bottle of Dolcetto DogliaAbbona for $56.00. We were seated in the upper level which is away from the crowd, however, if atmosphere is important this upper level is not for you. One of the owners came to our table and suggested we try the Agnolotti which was stupendous. The pasta was certainly fresh and delicious. If you want to spend quite a bit of money for a special meal this is the place, but I do suggest you make a reservation for the street level. Jacob was our server and did an excellent job.

This was light and unique and delicious.

This was our first visit to Perbacco. We often eat Italian food in San Francisco - I would rate this one very high. The food was excellent, all four of us were delighted with our appetizers and entrees. They make their own pasta and the sauces do delight! One of us didn't go for the pasta, but the quail instead and it was also very tasty. If you like big portions, this is not your place. Servings are adequate, perfect for my husband and me in fact, but we aren't big eaters. I think improvement could be made with some of the waiters - ours in particular. The service itself was excellent but he was kind of a downer - he was too serious about himself and trying to hard to be sophisticated. Turned out to be just pretentious and boring. Tried hard to loosen him up but it just wasn't happening. However, I would definitely go there again.

For one of the best fine dining venues in a city renowned for its cuisine, Perbacco needs to step up its game. Our server, Jamie, was inattentive at best, and the risotto app and scallop entree were under-seasoned and bland. I'll return, but with hopes for better attention to detail.

We had dinner on Saturday and it was crowded and noisy. You are practically rubbing elbows with guests at the adjacent tables and listening to their conversations. The menu selection and wine list are extensive. I had the beet salad, garganelli pasta with lamb ragu sauce, and glandula affoga for dessert. All were good, but nothing extraordinary or especially inspired. My wife had soup and the local fish, which was more impressive in presentation and reportedly delicious. The price was moderate, for 2 people with 3 glasses of wine 151 dollars before tax and tip.

Disappointing food and experience
Rating: 3
Date: February 17, 2017
Unfortunately, our dinner experience at Perbacco was disappointing -- both the food and service. Our wait person was rather unpleasant and quite annoying throughout the dinner. It began with his not giving us a chance to look over the menu before asking us about what we wanted to order. Then pouring our champagne (which was not chilled) and not giving us a minute to savor a few sips before bugging us again about our food order. I would understand better if the restaurant kitchen was closing in a few minutes and there was a need to quickly nail down our order but that was not the case. We had hoped to have an intimate leisurely Saturday night dinner. And there were plenty of empty tables so getting us in and out within the hour was not necessary. The knack of being a great server is to know just when to come around and check in on your guests,and not be in their face. The food left much to be desired -- the portions were small and not presented well. For example, we ordered the octopus starter -- a dish that we frequently order in restaurants. Perbacco should be embarrassed by the tiny piece that was placed on the plate. Laughable, actually. We ordered quail for our main dish -- the preparation was average. In summary, we were disappointed to have spent our Saturday evening dining at this restaurant especially since San Francisco has so many great restaurants. It was a waste of time and money. And we left hungry. There are better choices in the Financial District.

Having spent my honeymoon in the Piedmont region, I am always ready to try a new (to me) northern Italian restaurant or dish. This modern take on clean and creative Italian should not be missed when nearby. I started with a glass of Nebbiolo, perfect. Appetizer of poached, roasted and raw pear with sweet Gorgonzola that melted in the mouth. A light meal of raviola filled with butternut squash elevated the dish with the surprise of orange and cocoa nibs under a dusting of fried sage. Beyond the food, service was impeccable, friendly and helpful. Atmosphere was energetic without being too loud. I will suffer a red eye back to the east coast any day if it allows me the fortune of dining here again.

I have eaten here several times for both business and family travel and it is easily my favorite Italian restaurant in San Francisco. Most recently ate here with my wife and daughter on a family trip. We had the hamachi and octopus appetizers, shared some small pastas (pappardelle and gnocchi) and then dug into the entrees. Everything was fantastic. The wine list is good and not horrifically overpriced. While there are definitely some very expensive bottles to choose if you want, we stock with a couple lower priced bottles of barbaresco and were completely happy. Can't recommend enough and plan to visit again next month when i return on business.

If you are looking at quality food in SF at a non-excessive price, Perbacco is the right place. Pasta dishes are delicious, fish and meat are well cooked and prepared, choice of cheese is special, excellent desserts, impressive list of wines (mainly Piedmont area). The cuisine is Italian, but not only. We tried other restaurants in SF, but most are average, unless you want to pay much more, in particular in the Financial District, but still you have a sophisticated palate.The restaurant is always busy (that's always a good sign) and elegant.

The servers are friendly, knowledgeable and unobtrusive, the food is always perfect.

Our waiter was excellent, but the menu, while creative and with a broad range of interesting flavors, was actually rather limited. They don't even offer any salads on the menu, as a stand-alone item. There seems to be a lot of hype about this restaurant, I can see why but I think it's a bit of the "emperors new clothes ". Atmosphere is nice and fun, but the food is overall kind of disappointing for all the hype. The restaurant manager who handled our wine seemed quite a bit off that evening. We bought a nice bottle of red wine and asked him to decant it. He did so, but left the decanter off our table where they keep all their other wines. Maybe this is how things are done in this type a restaurant, but I've never encountered that before. Typically the wine decanters are left on your table. We had to wait till he came around before we could get refills. Also he made some strange errors with our bill, which we were trying to split in half, he even ended up giving us another table's bill. But despite all the errors, he really wasn't very apologetic or, accomodating overall. If you're looking for what's new and trendy now I guess you'll want to check this place out. But my husband I travel all over the country and all over the world and have been to some of the finest restaurants and are just very underwhelmed with this one.

We enjoyed a wonderful meal at Perbacco on New Years Eve. It was one of the few restaurants we could find that was not serving a special tasting menu. Instead, we were able to enjoy a fantastic meal together with our teenagers. Thank you Perbacco! My risotto with butter poached king crab and melted leeks was absolutely mouth watering, while my husband enjoyed his pappardelle with slow-cooked short rib ragu. The restaurant was festooned with balloons, though it would have been a nice touch if the tables had been decorated as well, with hats or streamers or something equally festive. We highly recommend and would definitely return.

Perbacco is right in the heart of the Financial District of San Francisco. The food is Italian-American and the preparations are delicious and high end. I had a gnocchi appetizer which was delicious and the sea scallops for an entree which were perfectly prepared. The wine list is extensive, particularly in the Italian wines and they have people who can help with choosing. The room is large and comfortable and not as loud as many SF hot spots so appropriate for a business meal in that you don't have to yell to hear. There is valet parking on the block and the cable car runs outside and BART is a few blocks away.

Special mention for their sommelier, who selected an outstanding wine for us at a reasonable price point ($50), and also to whoever came up with the pear and cheese appetizer and the chocolate dessert (starts with a " b") both of which were amazing.

I've been here several times and the food and service are always good. Can be very loud and packed on the weekends. Don't count on space at the bar.

We open the door and I greeted the host. We had a reservation and were seated immediately.Tables are very, very close to each other.Service is nice enough. If you do not know Italian culinary words, they can help you translated the menu. Very nice wine menu.... nice enough for a nice dinner.... exceptional, no.However the dark chocolate Bonet with a hint of sea salt, was quite delicious.....

In a city with so many great food options, it's hard to stand out. The ambiance is great for a night out with friends after work or even on the weekend and the good, overall, is also great. The octopus (piastra roasted octopus) appetizer was beautifully seasoned and not at all rubbery, which is a plus, and the tuna (pesce crudo) was well balanced with the various accoutrements. Both were excellent! The short rib in folded pasta (langoroli) had a sauce that was sufficient, not great which brought the dish down a peg, and the wide pasta with short rib Ragu (pappardelle) was well very good, but not excellent. Overall the food was enjoyable, but poorly portioned from beginning to end. Bigger portions would have resulted in a higher score, but in this city average overall is the best I can give. 

Highly recommended

Our son and a friend took us here for dinner on our final night in town. Amazing service and divine food was completed by an incredible recommendation for a bottle of wine. Everything was impeccable from start to finish. I would highly recommend Perbacco for anyone looking to impress clients, family or friends.

A bit of a "Food Factory" feel + Pricey enough for what's delivered....

For this, our first Trip to the West Coast of the USA as a Couple, we did quite a bit of "pre-planning", particularly as to where we might eat. We selected "Perbacco" for our final night in San Francisco largely because it was close to our Hotel (the Omni), and also because its ratings seemed fairly good.These are indeed very modern premises - large (apparently they can seat 150 Patrons), giving the impression, almost, of a "Food Factory". Our Booking was for 8 p.m., and we were surprised (it being a Monday night) that the place was "humming" when we arrived.Our "Main Server" proved to be a likable young lady called Tamara, who was attentive at the quite well-located Table allocated to us. There were some initial delays - for example, we ordered a bottle of "Fiano" (White), and it took a frustrating 25 Minutes for it to arrive, but things improved a bit thereafter."Perbacco" has an interesting Menu, with lots of choices. One of the laudable things they do is offer a choice of size of Pasta portion, something Europeans especially, would welcome. Our Food choices for "Starters" were a variation of "Steak Tartare" and a slow-roasted Veal Dish ; for "Mains" I opted for the smaller portion of "Papperdelle" (a thicker version of Tagliatelle), while M, my "Better Half", went for the "Seared Sea Scallops". The "Starters" were reasonably good ; my Papperdelle was cooked about right, (the Dish lacked flavour), while M pronounced her Scallops as being "pretty good". M also enjoyed a Glass of U.S. produced Pinot Noir with her "Main".We passed on Desserts. Our Bill/Check (before Gratuity) came to almost $180, which was a more reasonable total than some other venues in this truly expensive City, but quite pricey for what we viewed as being a very "Average" experience.

I enjoyed our most recent visit to Perbacco but didn't love what I ordered. Tuna crudo was relatively bland. Pork chop was good but not great. Probably should have just gotten a pasta dish. Brussels were a nice side but I've had better elsewhere as its become so popular. Service is always top notch. 

Perfect fine, but there are far better choices.

Perbacco is perfectly fine, but there are far better choices. Upon entering, there is very limited space to check in and wait for a table. You are crunched up against others waiting with people waiting and those at the bar. The decor is nice, yet bland. Dull. The highlight is a smart strip of mirrors that allow those facing the wall to seemingly look across the room. Nice touch. Service was fantastic. Our server knew the menu well, made great recommendations, was attentive but not intrusive. Five stars for her. We found the food to be very good but equally unexceptional. Nothing to write about. Had we ordered the $65 truffle menu items, perhaps we would have been amazed. Prices are typical SF yet on the high side. My glass of wine was $18 or $20 and quite delicious. A quick check on my app showed a bottle at $28 retail. Ouch. Entrees are overpriced at around $28-30. Restrooms are near a kitchen area, down the stairs, and with communal sinks. Turn the wrong way and you see the underbelly of the beast. Unimpressive. Overall, this is a perfectly fine place. But, one can do much, much better. 

Solid service, good food, nice ambiance make a good high-end dinner

Very much enjoyed dinner at Perbacco. The service was very attentive, prompt, pleasant but not pushy. Great bar. Solid food from appetizers through entrees and desserts. Busy and noisy, but not crowded. A wonderful place for a business dinner or evening out.

The pastas are always so good!For appetizer we had the Burrata, it came with butternut squash and pumpkin seeds, different and delicious. Salads are great also, but every time I go, I order the special ravioli, this time they had the butternut squash. They were so good, in the sweet side, so if you do not like sweet in your pasta this would not be for you. The salad with the pear was very good and you can never go wrong with the gnocchi. Always delicious!We were seated at a high and long table right next to the kitchen, it was very cool to be able to see the action, the only thing I didn't like is that at the end of the kitchen there was a very bright lightbulb, I kept moving following the head of our friend to cover me so the bright light would not bother my eyes. It would be good to put a screen so the client's eyes don't get bothered by the light, it's way to bright. Other than that I love the restaurant. Everyone is nice, one of the employees recognized my daughter from the last time she was there and made her feel like home. People like him make good places exceptional. He was just cleaning the table and made us all feel so welcomed.

We had an excellent waiter, Rapael, he spent an considerable amount time answering my questions about the menu and wine list. He made great recommendations for both. The food, wine and service could not have been better. The only reason Perbacco didn't get a 5th star from me was the atmosphere. It was very hot where we sat. So much so by the end if the meal I was sweaty and uncomfortable. I was going to order dessert but just couldn't do it due to the fact it was so warm. I wasn't the only diner that was warm either. I heard two others mention how hot they were.

Very, very popular place, and for good reason. Great food, great people watching, very good service, and not too pricey for SF. They have the stupid over-the-top prices for most bottles of wine, but good and half-way reasonably priced ones can be found. We have dined here multiple times and will return.

My husband and I went there for our 10th wedding anniversary. All of the good we ordered was delicious! Make sure to order the short ribs!!! The server was very attentive and also brought us out a complimentary desert at the end for our anniversary. The only complaint I have is that it's super loud!!!! If it was any other nigh this wouldn't have bothered me but it was our anniversary. I also think they could have some sort of candles on the table in the evening. Overall though, VERY good!!

Order the Pork Chop!

Date: October 10, 2016
Three of us had dinner at Perbacco last week and all of us raved about our food choices. Between us we had a pork chop, and two of the pasta dishes. All were absolutely delicious. The sommelier suggested a red wine that was moderately priced (for San Francisco) and very good. The service was excellent on all levels, from the bread--don't pass it up--to the wine to the food. The atmosphere was quiet enough that you could converse, but not hear the people next to you.Highly recommend for dinner.

Memorable birthday dinner

Everything from the service, food and dessert (yes receives its own category at this restaurant) was fantastic. My fiance and I were celebrating my birthday here.They even had a little birthday card for me at the table. Food: We shared three "small" portions of different pastas. the gnocchi (foie gras!), a ravioli and the braised beef pappardelle. Each was equally delicious and unique. I'm not typically a gnocchi fan but that was my favorite and probably the best I've ever had. We ordered a desert but they also bought out a house dessert for us which we both enjoyed better. They were these hazelnut meringue cookies and def some of the best cookies I've ever had. They are listed on the dessert menu as "ugly cookies" in Italian. Will definitely come back on our next trip to San Fran!

A good restaurant located on California avenue. the place is quite big, it has an upstairs dining area. The food is excellent, I'd be tempted to say inspired by american tradition food, with a touch of European finish. We ordered some great starters for the table (the steak tartare was delicious), followed by mains (fish, meat, pasta), all was very good. I did not pay the bill, but would expect this to place be pricy.

We visited Perbacco twice, and each time we very much enjoyed the place. The food, although straightforward and unpretentious, is excellently and sophisticatedly prepared. The service, both times, was highly professional--that is, kind, alert, responsive and friendly. It's a very nice downtown place, and open on Saturday nights too.

Loved it.

A recommendation of the concierge in the St.Regis. Modern glass frontage hides a cavernous, lively interior. We had a table at the back by the kitchen. Service efficient and friendly. A variety of Piemontese dishes ( some of which we didn't know despite having lived in Italy ) and a carefully selected wine list. Cooking exhibits flair and passion. Can become quite noisy when full. Will definitely go again.

Food was delicious. Service terrific. Staff personable and attentive. A little noisy, but wonderful ambiance and very comfortable. Stairs and elevator available. Two of us ordered the braised short ribs with polenta. Another ordered the scallops. Another ordered a pasta dish. Every dish was superbly done. Wait for food was a little long, but it was worth the wait. A bit pricey, but highly recommended. I would return.

Perbacco is one of my favorite restaurants for business lunch in the downtown area of San Francisco. I went yesterday with 3 others and we all left very happy and full! We ordered Fritto Misto, Ahi Tuna and Heirloom Tomato appetizers. The Fritto Misto (I called it Italian version of Vegetable Tempura) is just awesome. The Heirloom Tomatoes were very tasty as well. Each of us in our group ordered different entrees which made it interesting to see a variety of there menu items live. Our party ordering the duck, the skirt steak, the tuna salad and the Pappardelle with short rib ragu (insanely delicious). All of the food is fresh, hot and very delicious.Our waitress was very attentive, we were a lively group too. We had the large wooden table right off the kitchen serving line, it was perfect. This place is a must try if you are looking for great food different from your standard Italian restaurant.
