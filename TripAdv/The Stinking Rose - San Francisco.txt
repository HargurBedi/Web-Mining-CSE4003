The day we had lunch here it was not at all crowded. The service was excellent. The food was delicious and very pleasantly garlicky. The only disappointment was the roasted garlic appetizer which was supposed to be served with focaccia but came with cold dinner rolls instead. If the waiter had told us, we would have made a different choice.

Garlic lovers will definitely love it ❤️

I really like garlic and I absolutely like that place - think about to made a reservation! Lot of different places in the restaurant e.g. little cabins for up to 4 personEverything with garlic from salad to ice cream, it world famous but the hosts are still absolutely friendly and the service is pretty fast!PS: You should try the baby ribs with mashed potatoes - clear, that both is toped with garlic ;-)

Lunch was really good. The waiter was very friendly and gave really good service. We had the 40 clove garlic chicken with Caesar salad. It was very good, though I thought there could have been more sauce on the chicken. We visited San Francisco on a cruise ship and made it a point to have lunch at the Stinking Rose. It was well worth the walk.

We stumbled upon this restaurant as part of our hotel's recommendation. We had a chuckle over the name of the restaurant. The next day as we were making our way to the Crooked Street we walked by the restaurant at around the lunch hour so we decided to give it a try. We were not that hungry but wanted something quick to eat. Our waiter talked about a starter dish of just garlic cloves with a sprinkling of anchovies that came with bread rolls that would go well with two onion/potato soups that we ordered. We barely ate any of the garlic clove starter as we did not like it and asked the waiter to take it away as we would not be eating it. I was hoping that we would not be charged $10 for it but we were. Unless you love garlic and I really mean love garlic I would not order this starter. Very overpriced menu considering we paid $60 for the garlic starter, two soups one beer and a coke. To be fair to this restaurant we were not there for supper to try any of their main courses.

This is an Italian restaurant on Columbus. The food is very good--restaurant is surprisingly large. I had the black linguini with seafood which was good. Service was excellent. Easy to get to from downtown--walk through chinatown and its right there on Columbus.

We found this restaurant by pure chance while on an open top bus tour around the city, as we are both garlic lovers we decided to give it a try on our last night in san francisco, it was a sunday night and we pre booked a table online, we arrived 7.30 ish and the place was quite busy, the restaurant is very deceiving from the outside and we were shown down a corridor to a series of dining booths, after a few minutes browsing the menu, it was decided we would share a starter 'garlic soaking in a hot tub' this consisted of garlic cloves oven roasted in olive oil & butter in an iron skillet, there must have been 40 cloves bubbling away and the idea is to spread it on focaccia bread, wow! Total garlic explosion,For the main course we both ordered garlic meatballs although i could have been swayed by a group of girls opposite who ordered the 40 clove chicken, anyway the meatballs arrived on a bed of spaghetti with garlic bread, there must have been 8 meatballs or more, would like to say devoured but even adam richman (man v food) would have struggled with this size meal, tried our best but, we hit the wall,really enjoyed our visit to stinking rose and would recommend it to anyone who loves garlic, just one last thing, please open a restaurant in the u.k

This is an interesting place. Decor is unique with bottles of Chianti and corks hanging from the ceiling. Bottle candle holders are reminders from the 60s and 70s. Reservation was easy and service was excellent. The lasagna was average. My girlfriend liked the linguine with clams. Despite the claim, food did not have strong garlic flavor. The house wine was ok but to expensive. Overall, it is expensive relative to the quality of food.

Less Garlicky options too

My wife was excited when she whole cloves of garlic in her dish as she expected. I loved the pesto sauce at the table it was simple and fresh. I got the less garlicky ravioli with chicken and a nice cream sauce. What the chicken lacked in quality the pasta made up for it. Great window seat experience and great atmosphere.

If you don't like garlic, don't go here. If you like garlic, you may want to live here. I don't think I've eaten anything here that I didn't like. But, be warned, you will probably smell like garlic for two days straight. And no, showers don't help. If you have a chance to eat here, don't miss the opportunity to do so. I live in MN and find myself craving the food here 3-4 times a year. It's that good.

We dined at the Sinking Rose while we were traveling for business to San Francisco and found it to be a unique, entertaining experience. We started with the garlic onion soup and followed with entrees of chicken and asparagus and garlic noodles. For sides we had the roasted garlic bulb, creamed spinach, and garlic mashed. We topped our meal with a bottle of Coppola and finished with espressos and garlic ice cream. All in all, it was a delightful experience and we found no dishes to be distasteful or possess too strong of a garlic flavor.I am uncertain that if we lived in the area that we would make this a regular stop, however, we definitely enjoyed our visit and if we had occasion to be in the area again, would not hesitate to return.

This was my favourite SF restaurant when visiting from NZ but this time the food quality was variable and disappointing. I had recommended it to my friends. Steak delicious but the lobster expensive and really tough. We were a group of six and all tasted the lobster and agreed that it was dry and stringy. The crab was also dry and overcooked. Perhaps it was an off night for the chef. Good service and a cheerful atmosphere but improvements are needed.

Garlic, garlic, and more garlic. Who would have thought that a restaurant's focus would be garlic? The garlic is one of a number of factors that makes The Stinking Rose unique.The menu offered plenty go garlicky choices; even garlic ice cream (we didn't try it!). With the exception of the garlic infused olive oil in which to dip your bread, we did not find the garlic overwhelming. It was just right. Food was well prepared and nicely presented. Service was just right. It was reasonably fast but there was no sense of being rushed. Our server was friendly and attentive.We were served in a booth. Although no bigger than a booth in any restaurant it had floor to ceiling partitions, and some small drapes at the open end. It was almost like having a private dining room.Be sure to bring your wallet. Like most San Francisco restaurants The stinking Rose is on the expensive side. Good food, good service and a nice environment. We got our monies worth

We visited The Stinking Rose on our first night in SF after a long flight, booking this in advance of our travel and looking forward to dining in this famous restaurant. The food was very mediocre and disappointingly did not live up to our expectations. I can see that if you dined in a group, it could be a fun night out, however it really wasn't for us, it was also fairly expensive and really not worth the money.

If you don't like garlic then this may not be a good choice for you to visit. They use a substantial amount of garlic in everything they prepare.We started with the mussels. I have reviewed another restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, that I hope is still in business after Irma, that I feel has the best mussel appetizer I have ever had. This would be the second best. Did I mention garlic is involved?There are many selections on the menu. They have a 3 course meal with several different entrees and that is what we both decided on. She had the Chicken (40 cloves of garlic...no kidding) and I had the traditional Spaghetti and Meatballs. Both arrived relatively hot but too close to our appetizer arrival. The table we were at was relatively small and there was barely enough room to keep all the dishes on there. The meal came with dessert.

This is a nice restaurant, the novelty factor being high garlic content in everything on the menu and the longest string of garlic you've ever seen hung around the rooms! We were seated in an individual booth which was nice, but there are open tables as well. We were seated within 5 minutes of our booked time and service was fairly good. The menu is a bit limited but what we ordered was goo. Overall price was a bit of he expensive side compared to other restaurants and their quality of service/food. However we really enjoyed it and would recommend a visit, but probably only a one off rather than returning again.

Although our dinner felt rushed, we were done and dusted inside an hour, it was nonetheless enjoyable. I had the ravolli with shrimps added, and the shrimp pasta was also declared very good! The garlic and bread starter met the menu's description and was a great way to start the meal. The service was OK, pleasant though seemed to want to get us out the door. We're glad we tried The Stinking Rose, though probably wouldn't go back.

As a garlic lover, I was extremely excited to go to Stnking Rose and booked a month ahead.When we arrived we were immediately seated. We chose the garlic appetizer and I ordered the BBQ ribs with garlic and my wife chose a pasta and garlic dish. Mine was dry and boring, and while the pasta was good.However as a tourist restaurant things move too quickly and we were finished in under an hour.Bottom line: it was mediocre and we would never return. However, when we left, the wait list was over a hour long.So if you like Garlic and tourist places, go here. But if you like garlic, a leisurely meal, and great food, go elsewhere.

We didn't have a good meal here. There's lots of garlic, which is great but two of the main courses were very poor and the extra garlic did not disguise this. The prime rib was indescribably awful - tough and rubbery. Only the salmon and salads were ok. Would not return.

Of all the places we ate in San Francisco during our trip, I think this was my favorite. We went pretty early so there wasn't much of a crowd just yet, but it started to get busy as we finished up. The atmosphere was pretty cool - they had some neat and quirky souvenirs you could buy, and also the world's longest garlic bread along the ceiling. We were seated right by the window which I thought was lovely, so we could people watch a little.As far as the food, I loved the complimentary bread with the garlic dipping oil, I could've eaten that all day. I ordered the cioppino dish, which was just what I needed, as i had failed to eat a lot of San Franciscan food during my trip. There was so much good seafood in this soup. I thought the service was also outstanding as our waiters seemed very attentive. If I venture back out to San Francisco I would definitely return.

A friend and I visited on Saturday 19th August. We were seated in one of the booths which I'd recommend asking for - felt like a personal experience away from the main dining area, which was buzzing. The service was excellent and the food was great - from the warm bread and garlicy pesto to start, to the cioppino which we shared (a medium size is more than enough for two). Food was on the pricey side but a great experience if you like garlic!

This used to be my go to restaurant in San Francisco based on combination of price and food quality. We went there last week and noticed the prices are substantially higher than last year, and although the main courses are still very tasty, the bread tastes very cheap, almost like the soft cheap dinner rolls you would get at a diner. If this place would serve authentic hard crust Italian bread with the meal it would be a much better dining experience. I get the sense that others are sharing my disappointment, as this once busy restaurant that used to require a reservation days in advance was only half full on a Saturday evening.

Yes, this is a garlic-themed restaurant in San Francisco's tourist popular North Beach, center of the Italian cultural community. But I love garlic; so there! The main event is the zuppa di pesce, i.e., cioppino. Probably the best anywhere, with a variety of shellfish and fresh scale fish. It comes in three sizes, and bibs are provided, because eating it will be a messy experience. We ordered the "small" for two, following past experience confirmed by our server's advice. We accompanied it with a nice, crispy Caesar salad and a carafe of the house red. Prices are reasonable for San Francisco: better food and value than, say, FIsherman's Wharf. Principal challenge is finding a place to park within walking distance, but the "30 Stockton" bus stops right in front.

This is a nice Italian restaurant with a lively, friendly atmosphere. The food comes in 'normal' sized portions not the huge ones you find in some US restaurants. My son had the lamb shank which was very tender as were the ribs. I found most things on the pricey side, around $25 for a bowl of pasta with pesto sauce seemed a bit much although it was perfectly pleasant.

It feels as if they are milking a good idea (and yes we do love garlic) but are not really attending to quality - plus their turn over of covers is so busy, we felt we were 'processed' rather than served and it wasn't a relaxing or fun meal. The chicken and pork chop were OK but could have been better for the price - canteen-style presentation. This is a novelty act really - fun marketing & merchandise but tired food I'm afraid.

Visited this restaurant at our son's recommendation and we were definitely not disappointed. A very quirky name but all becomes clear where the name comes from once you look at the menu. Garlic with everything.The bread basket which we munched on while deciding what to eat was filled with garlic flavoured bread, getting us into the mood for what was to follow.I opted for the forty clove garlic chicken, which was delicious, the chicken was cooked perfectly and so tasty, served with garlic mashed potato and 40 roasted cloves of garlic on the side. I adore garlic so this was heaven for me.The restaurant was very busy (we had booked a table) but the service was good despite the number of diners. There is also a small shop selling souvenirs of your visit.We would definitely go back to this restaurant it was great.

If you aren't used to a lot of garlic-get some Tums-my stomach was not happy with me the next day which made for a not so great afternoon of sightseeing. (Not the restaurants fault-think I used a little too much of the yummy garlic spread in the rolls )

Good eats but Vampires beware.

A San Francisco institution with plenty of atmosphere and kitsch. The smell of garlic permeates the atmosphere and you'll be full of it when you leave. Good portions, Good food and reasonably priced for the bay city. We had the lasagna and meatloaf and enjoyed every bite, but the shrimp garlic skillet appetizer was underwhelming. Definitely worth a visit and I have a meal there every time I'm visiting but definitely make a reservation before you go. 

It was fun

I was in SF for an appointment and my beloved had this restaurant recommended by a very good friend of ours. It is very quaint, and decorated in a fun manner. They are very proud of the garlic that is used in everything. It was a good meal but not great. I don't really believe that the garlic was roasted long enough. My shrimp was a little to cooked but still edible and enjoyable. The cost is very bay area and they pass on the city wage increase! That being said, it's SF and be prepared that you will always pay more for just being in the city. Now, there is a restaurant named Louis Cairo in Williams CA that knows how to use garlic. Maybe they could share their skills, both have something to offer.

This place was fantastic. Our waitress couldn't have been more polite and helpful. She made the visit great. The prime rib was excellent and the creamed spinach was delicious. This is a must stop if you are in San Francisco. 

Good service, ok food

Wee were greeted and seated qui kly for such a buddy place. Our server and bus boy were very nice and checked on us regularly. We didn't lack for anything. The food was good but we expected better for being in little italy. We had spaghetti and meatballs. It wasn't overly flavorful but the meatballs were better. We also had the raviolis with basil cream sauce. A little more flavor but no kick. The bread for an Italian place was terrible! No yummy hard crust bread like you expect. We wouldnt go back because there are to many better ones to try. For the price it should be much better.

Food was served pretty quick and very hot. The Stinking Rose was a good choice for a last minute dinner decision.

My husband and I went today for lunch to The Sinking Rose, it was such a disappointment. We saw on Facebook that some of our friends had been there so we wanted to try it. We ordered spaghetti with meatballs and they were tasteless, we had to put a lot of salt, no garlic flavor at all. Even the bread was dry. And the worst part is that we paid $70 for 2 really bad pasta dishes. We don't recommend this place at all, don't waist your money. 

Everything is GOOD!

My fifth time here. I go whenever I'm visiting San Francisco. Sizzling shell fish appetizer is awesome. End the meal with the Garlic ice cream. It is an experience..

One of the first places I came to discover when I moved to the SF Bay Area some 40+ years ago. Always good food, good service, great atmosphere and when coupled with special people in your life, makes this a terrific eatery and place to hang out. Sincerely, enjoy.

Fabulous

I had the lasagna and my husband had the prime rib. We also had roasted garlic in oil to spread on bread. The food was fantastic. As long as you like garlic, you should love this restaurant.

Great atmosphere! Great wait staff! Great garlic! Oh, my! Garlic is the theme at Stinking Rose. The complimentary rolls with parsley/garlic "pesto" was sooo garlicky but so addictive! Eat at this iconic San Francisco restaurant!

Got reservations on open table and was really looking forward to trying this place. Extremely disappointed. The place was not busy and it took about 15 min for someone to come to our table to take a drink order. Spaghetti and meatballs were gross. How do you screw up that? Also, if you are traveling with children they do not have a kids menu.

Somewhat Disapointed

The restaurant was tacky cute and smelled of garlic of course. The rolls were delicious, full of garlic. I had linguine with pesto sauce that was just average. My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs which was delicious.

Garlic lovers paradise!

This restaurant lived up to my expectations. My main entree was the 40 clove chicken and everything about the plate was impressive from presentation, aroma, texture and flavor. But as with anything, too much of a good thing is bad and knowing I ate over 100 cloves of garlic that evening I had no idea of the aftermath it would play on my stomach and having a cross-country flight early the next morning I'm sure I was not the popular person according to my seat neighbors. A surprising delight was the ice cream, never would I have guessed ice cream and garlic would mesh so well! I highly recommend making this a mandatory stop to anyone visiting San Francisco just remember...moderation...moderation...moderation!

Very good steak

This is a very nice restaurant in San Francisco. Their steaks are one of a kind. Great service all throughout. The only reason that I'm not rating this any higher is that my personal favorite is Japanese beef.

Wow!

This restaurant is definitely worth a visit - service, meal and atmosphere all excellent. I would have happily just eaten the bread and garlic sauce until I was full! No need to order main course! Definitely recommend to anyone visiting this buzzing city.

Popped in off the street for some lunch. After a friendly greeting and immediate seating, we waited. And Waited. After 10 minutes of sitting while other servers came and went, we stood up to leave when a server appeared. He was filled with regret and sorrow for being slow - he was called in at the last minute and his tables were on different sides of the restaurant - Blah, Blah. Everyone seated in his tables, received the same treatment and same response. SERVICE was TERRIBLE! And oh, the food, pizzas were disgusting. We left 75% of the food on the table! Avoid this place, too many better places in same neighborhood.

We were scared that because of its popularity this restaurant would be overpriced and under-deliver. Not so! We split 2 prix fixe meals and 2 apps among 4 people and it was just right, both in portion and cost. Garlic on everything but your dessert is a fabulous way to eat.

Ooft!

The Stinking Rose is a tremendous venue, great and authentic decor with excellent service. The bread was incredible, the clams were delightful, the wine was superb, and the steak was perhaps one of the finest I've ever eaten. Worth every cent.

Yummy Garlic!

Adorable restaurant in the Italian neighborhood of San Francisco! Everything included garlic, even the ice cream (sorry, we didn't try that)! The atmosphere was great, felt right at home, everyone was very friendly and attentive. My salmon may have been the best I've ever eaten, at least in recent memory, it was fabulous! Excellent wine selection! Would definitely return!

Best salmon my husband has ever had

Reviews suggested the bagna calda, but if we go again, I'll skip it because it wasn't as impressive as the garlic relish that comes free on the table. The creamed spinach is incredible (comes with the prime rib, which was also perfect). And of course, my husband won't stop raving about the salmon with "the garlic paprika butter thing."

Been a while, but service and food were great both times

Wife and I have been here twice about 6 years apart. Both times food was outstanding and restaurant was easily able to accommodate my wife's shellfish allergy. She went for the 40 clove chicken while I did a ciapinno. We finished with a mug of garlic ice cream. Really, how can you beat a restaurant that advertises "We season our garlic with food?"

Better than expectations

I thought that because of so many reviews, this restaurant might go the way of others and slip with their service. Not so. The Stinking Rose was very good. We arrived earlier than our reservation, but were promptly seated. The table we were given wasn't big enough for the four of us, so they relocated us to a slightly larger one. The tables and chairs do feel somewhat crowded. Some call that intimate. The service was very good and the plate of buttery cloves was tasty. I had the larger portion of prime rib, which was a little too much for me. Should have taken the smaller offering. Chianti was okay. Overall the meal was very good. The value is fair, but you are eating in San Francisco.

My wife and I have eaten here several times before, about 10 years apart, each time. This time we brought another couple.I happy to conclude that they have changed very little in that time frame. Although, they have lost a lot of the earthy-bohemian decor that they started with years ago, I miss it, but I was younger then...anyway the food is pretty much the same. It's a fun place to eat.

Good, fun restaurant

Even though it's totally a touristy place it was a good choice. We were all happy with our meals and the place is decorated to the hilt with wine bottles and photos etc. kinda cool looking. The menu of course is completely garlic oriented and fun. We had a cheese garlic fondue starter and mussels in garlic sauce, pasta with garlic pesto. It was all very tasty. Not overly expensive. Our dinner experiences during our week in San Francisco weren't very impressive and this was by far our favorite meal.
