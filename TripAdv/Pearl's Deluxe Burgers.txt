Deluxe 1/4 pounder with Fries

Popped in for a take away Deluxe 1/4 pounder (cooked medium) with Fries. Fries were excellent, crispy and tasty. No salt, so you need to add plenty if you like your fries salty. The burger was disappointing, mayo, very nice lettuce, tasteless tomato, too much red onion, and the patty was pretty dry, not juicy. Not terrible, just not a good quality burger.

Stopped here for lunch on Friday about noon. We picked it based on yelp reviews and it's proximity to our hotel. It is is a very small place with about 15 or so seats with a few tables and some counter seating. They only take cash but you can order online and pay with a card or use the ATM they have inside.We checked out the menu, placed our orders at the counter and had a seat. The place really filled up while we were there. They even had people waiting for to go orders. I ordered the mini (1/4 lb) BBQ burger (burger, bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce and grilled onions on a bun). My wife ordered the mini bacon cheese burger. We also had an order of half onion rings and half fries. Our order was delivered to our table rather quickly.The food was good, the service was good, the place was small. This place is solid for burgers.

The food at Pearl's is definitely as good as all the reviews say. We had Deluxe burgers with cheese. There is a choice of different cheeses and the burgers can be cooked as you like them. The garlic fries are very garlicky but tasty and my mint Oreo milkshake was super thick and super delicious. There are only 3 or 4 tables so get there early or late or be prepared to stand or take away. Yummy

The guy who served me was helpful and friendly and even checked I knew the buffalo burger was made with buffalo meat and wasn't just the name of it.

Graffitied tiny little nook of local dining reccommended by the doorman of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. Not to be missed. High quality ingredients, clean delicious flavours. You order at the counter, get your own cutlery and napkins, then just wait for your freshly made meal to arrive. We had buffalo burgers, medium rare and fries. One portion between 4 people is more than enough. Just a truly delicious experience.

Visiting SF for 3 days from the UK, on our last night we fancied traditional American burgers, a quick search for burger bars close to our hotel (Hilton, Union Square) revealed Pearl's to be the recommended choice with an average score of 4.6. Luckily one of the two tables was available when we arrived. A large selection of burgers were available and after we chose it was only a short wait before the burgers and sides were delivered. We were not to be disappointed, the food was delicious and reasonably priced for the quality. There are negatives such as the limited eating area but that is a factor of the size of the restaurant and therefore it would be harsh to mark them down because of that.

We went there at 9:50 pm for a takeaway since in here it says they close at 11 pm. From the moment I got in someone from their staff started repeating without even listening to me "we're closed! We're closed!". When I told him that here they had a different closing time he didn't care at all. I don't know how good their burgers are but they could improve their manners!

On my own for lunch -so I asked at the front desk for a place to get lunch- walked to Pearls- First-- cash only place ! They do have an ATM machine-place is quite small on the inside maybe five tables so if you have a large group it may not work for you. I got a burger with all the fixings with sweet potato fries the cost was $13. It's a typical burger place-But if you're looking for a great burger this is it!

I found this place 4 years ago just walking by... That day I ate the best buffalo burger i had ever had... but since then I have been there once every year.. & every year hass been a little worse & the prices higher...Minumum for a buffalo burger is $16... plus extra $ for cheese or avo or other toppings...Their sweet potato fries are $6...They have i think 4 small metal bar tables. That's it. You order at the counter.I will not be going back. Burger was ok but I've had way better& cheaper than that. It is now just a tourists place...

Went here for lunch as I'm always on the hunt for the ultimate burger. Sadly, this isn't it but it's a damn good burger anyway.The place is a tiny hole-in-the-wall run by very friendly people and the food is hot and fresh and in generally very good! So I had the mini burger which is a 4oz burger -- a perfect size in my opinion. The normal burger is 8oz which must be monstrous! In any event I had my burger the standard "deluxe" way, which is lettuce, tomato, mayo and I added cheese (of course) and grilled onions instead of raw. And a small side of fries. Luckily I went at an "off" time and was able to find a seat at the window. About 5 minutes later the burger comes out -- and man does it look pretty damn good! The burger was cooked perfectly (medium -> medium well) so no complaints. The tomato was a nice rich red color. Lettuce was bibb and crunchy. Onions were amazing. So -- what's the issue? The bun! I gathered later (from talking to the owner) they get special buns from a sister baking company close by. Too me they were too thick and too much sesame. I tasted a lot of sesame which isn't welcome to me in a burger. Both the top and bottom of the buns were covered in sesame seeds. Way too much bread in each bite and not enough of the juicy burger. Bad bun to burger ratio is a no-no in my burger book. They also didn't griddle the bun (or if they did it needed to be much longer) .. So strike two on the bun.However, the fries were absolutely fantastic. These are addictive fries to be sure! They also make their own onion rings in house, which is intriguing since they are breaded -- from again -- left over bread from their sister bakery. Hopefully not left over sesame buns! :) In all a decent burger joint -- and everyone is very service friendly -- and the fries are worth it and it seems like the milkshakes could be too from all the ones I saw (and they just introduce salted caramel milkshakes!!! )

Nothing Special
Rating: 2
Date: June 3, 2017
This is low grade industrial tourist food. Burger and fries, and no drink for $15. Frozen mystery meat patty. Over-sized meaningless bun. Fries coated with that starchy stuff. Crispy, but nasty. The burger had no flavor other than the smoke flavor from the factory and it was under cooked. The bun was not toasted and, except for the sesame seeds, had nothing going for it. They don't take cards, but have a conveniently placed atm robbery machine next to the register. The place looks like it might be good from the street, with the fancy signage and the line. But if all your going to get is a Sysco special your far better off with a fast food burger at half the price. Now watch the "save my reputation" astroturfers post a succession of contradictory reviews, raving about the place. See it for what it is. San Francisco is known throughout the world as a great food town. This place does not measure up.

After ordering online, I went to pick up my burger and fries. I was really excited to eat a delicious burger from Pearl's, but once I picked it up and cut it in half back at my office, I found PUBIC HAIR between the burger and the cheese. This place has a 100% health rating, seriously? Going back to Pearl's to talk to the cashier, he only comped me the burger, and refused to give me the contact info for the owner. What a waste! Don't eat here unless you want pubes in your mouth.

I'm just so outdone with SF restaurants, I have had nothing good to eat here. I climbed up the hill and down the hill to get to this spot with such rave reviews and wonderful awards and all I got was previously frozen tasteless burgers with absolutely no seasoning. Don't be fooled by all the fancy toppings they mask the fact that your burger is tasteless. The garlic fries were mediocre and the sweet potato fries taste like the bags ones from Walmart or your local grocery store. So $36 later (2 people) save your money and go somewhere else.

True to the reviews, this is a tiny place with a great local burger. There are only 2 tables and 4 chairs in a line facing the window storefront. However, out family of four was fortunate to have scored one of the two tables. All the burgers were cooked to perfection; I had the spicy Sly burger which was wonderful. We shared the garlic fries which had lots of sauteed garlic sprinkled throughout. The staff were exceedingly friendly and brought our lunches to the table after ordering at the counter.

The meat is high quality and juicy and has a perfect texture. It would be just fine served plain, sans bun as well! The rings have a peppery flavor and crunch just right. I enjoy the fries as well (crunchy and tender in all the right places), but I'm a rings guy...Very clean, well staffed and a definite bright spot in the neighborhood.

I had a burger with bacon and french fries. They cost only about 15 dollars, which I think is quite cheap. Only minus is that the place is small, there is just a few table and chair. But that didn't bother me so much, cause the people were nice and you feel the good spirit there. Service was great there, so I fully recommend to visit the Pearl's.

Fresh Tasting, nicely seasoned Kobe burger

A colleague and I recently ate at Pearl's during a business trip, as it was a short walk from our hotel. Nothing overly impressive about this place and you would likely walk by if you weren't a local or were looking for it. Several tables await you as you walk in and you order, pay Cash Only and then either take it to go or have a quick seat. The menu would be pleasing to most in terms of options, but burgers are the anchor. We opted for Kobe burgers and had then prepared differently in terms of the myriad of choices. The burgers tasted very fresh, were cooked to perfection and were seasoned well. Decent price you will pay, but not grossly over the top in terms of quality and that is the judgement here. Would I go back - Yes, but whereas I've checked the Pearl's box I likely would explore more of the city. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop in and enjoy a bite.

But we called ahead and ordered burgers, chicken burgers, hot dogs and shakes for take out and they were great. The hot dog was 'aberage' said my son. But the cheeseburgers and chicken burgers (made with grilled chicken breast)w were great. The one milkshake we ordered wasn't thick or particularly cold but acceptable. Business was going well tonight with lots of takeaway. Oh - I eat low carb and was pleased to find I could order my burger on lettuce. It was good. Prices fair for food provided. Staff very friendly

CASH ONLY and FANTASTIC choice. I walked several blocks from my hotel to the "tenderloin", aka poorer part of town, just off of Union Square. I was intrigued by the garlic fries more than the burgers. I did not have a milkshake because I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't speak to the fantastic shakes. There was a sign on the door that "shakes are back" so there must have been a break in that service. Four stars for 2 reasons: They asked how I wanted my burger. I said rare; it came out medium, debatably medium-well. Second, it was $15 for a burger, garlic fries, and small soda pop... That's a bit high to me for a quick, no frills lunch. Burger was good, though it didn't WOW me. I will say that those fries were FANTASTIC, and I was breathing garlic all day long.

The meat is really juicy and full of flavour. You can even have Kobe beef or Buffalo at an additional price. Great bread, very fresh vegetables and thick creamy milkshakes.

After spending the past few days and nights eating at some pretty upscale restaurants with my wife's family, we decided that we'd just like to have something for dinner a little more casual and laid back. The TripAdvisor app said this place was good and close by so off we went. We actually almost walked by it the first time as it is pretty easy to miss. When we walked in there was a line to the door. As crowds don't lie we figured this place must be good.I ordered their "regular" (1/2 lb) mushroom swiss burger and it was really big (actually too big, a 1/4 lb would have done just fine), juicy and flavorful. My wife ordered the mini (1/4 lb) deluxe and loved it. We split an order of garlic fries and that was a bit too garlicky for me. My breath reaked the rest of the night and the next morning. Seating is extremely limited. There were absolutely no seats when we ordered but while waiting a couple opened up at the store front. Not sure it was as amazing as some of the other reviews but it was definitely a good burger. If we're ever in this area again we would come back.

My partner and I ate Pearls Deluxe Burgers during our stay in San Francisco. The restaurant is tiny, so we decided to take our food back to our hotel, but it was SO worth it. The burger was delicious and the meat cooked perfectly. You can help yourself to the pickles which is awesome! We shared the Nutella thickshake which was lovely and also had the "spries" which was half fries half sweet potato fries. I had never had sweet potato before, so I was not sure what to expect, but they were delicious. The plain fries were also great. Would visit again! 

Tiny but good

Thisis a tiny cafe and very busy, so lots of people getting served food but having to wait to get a seat. Service was good, food was good, can't say more. A good burger place.

Pearl's has some of the best burgers, and fries, that you can think of. A true haven for burger connoiseurs. If you like it spicy, try the Spicy Sly or if you like the barbecue version, try the Phat Bob :).

Best burger i've had

Buffalo burgers. I could finish my review here but I can't. Got the privilege to go various times while living in SF and absolutely loved this place. I went to many places to try other hamburguers but non matched my experience on Pearl's. Great service and amazing burgers,

No discussion: an above average burger

If you take the chance of having no seating in this small restaurant for granted this is the place for a decent, tasty burger with bacon, American cheese and crispy fries.

Went here for lunch as recommended here by TripAdvisor. You do not let me down. The place is tiny but busy - which is a good sign. I got the pesto burger & DH got a blue cheese w/ bacon. We split a garlic fry - which was a good thing as the burger is large. He is a burger guy & said it was the best one he's had in awhile- which is a major statement. I ordered well done & it arrived medium- that is the reason I went with a 4 instead of a 5- otherwise a home run place. Go hungry. I also appreciate the free water with your meal.

Many restaurants in San Fran seem to be tucked into small spaces and this was one of them. It had been recommended by the staff at the Tilden Hotel and when we arrived at first we were hesitant to try it. But, we went in, menu was extensive, prices were reasonable for the city, and we ordered. Small seating area but was clean. The turkey burger with swiss ( $8.99 ) I received was HUGE, hot, and delicious. The fries were great as well but I really did not have room to eat more than a third of them. Evidently you can also order online and pick-up. Would recommend.

Good burger!

Loved the burger!!! Wasn't too into the curly fries. But the burger was great. Staff is friendly. There's little seating, but they also do take away. Nice for a quick bite.

Delicious burgers

It was a hole in the wall place that only takes cash. I ordered the deluxe with chz and bacon, husband ordered mushroom burger. Both tasted fantastic. We split the half and half onion rings/fries. Too much food for us. If we get to go there again, we will def split a burger.

A little disappointing

Decided to get take out from here based on prior reviews. Ordered 2 burgers both were not as ordered. (Mayo when asked for none, buffalo when asked for Kobe). The burgers were very big but not as flavorful as I had hoped...Blue cheese was the best part. I enjoy searching for the "best burger" but this definitely wasn't it. 

Good burger. Quick stop.

Very nice burger. Cheese deluxe. No beer served. Seating itself is fast food so. It worth it for a night out. Perfect if after a quick bite. 

Friendly staff, delicious burgers

Had the deluxe with cheese, the meat is really juicy. It could do with a sauce or chutney on top of the aioli that's on the lettuce but it was still really nice anyway. The burgers are huge! Come hungry. The garlic fries were nice, maybe a bit too much garlic but we still finished them!

Friendly service and great selection of burgers. This is a place to get take-out or for a quick stop as limited seating.

Not the Best in SF... overpriced and average

I ate here during lunch time after seeing good reviews online. This place is very small and feels crowded very easily. Two four tops and three chairs at the window is all. I had to wait in line to refill my soda and wait in line again to get back to my seat. I tried the Buffalo Burger which I assume is Bison meat. I've had bison elsewhere in SF so based on that previous experience, I was very disappointed in the Pearl's Buffalo Burger. The meat was grocery store quality and cooked well-done even though I asked for med-well. It cost significantly more than expected. $22 for this burger with cheese and avocado, and this is not an upscale neighborhood by any means though I'm sure their rent is outrageous. The service by the order-taker/cashier was excellent considering everything else. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place unless you are really craving a burger and live close enough to get a burger to-go.

Fantastic

One of the best burgers I have ever had. Great variety and good sides, with Kobe beef available. Prepared well, and quickly. Highly recommended.

Small and friendly place where we had the best burgers during our stay in San Francisco. We were not sure if the food would be good as the place does not look smart and it may be tricky to find a place to seat at times but it is worth it.

Mouthwatering burgers

This little place has some really fantastic burgers. Just went for the classic deluxe with some great garlic fries on the side, all of them really tasty.

So good we went twice on our weeks trip! Very tasty burgers and great value for money. If you love burgers just go to Pearls. Frings are big enough to share between two!

I was hungry!

Being on East Coast time, it was 6pm according to my stomach! Pearls was near where I dropped off my Avis car. I'm also staying about 2 blocks away. I had the mushroom burger with added avocado. Side of home made onion rings. I've not seen so many fresh mushrooms on a burger. Bun was big, soft and I had to take the top off and eat it separately as burger was so big.

This is one of the best burgers I have had in the USA. You can order your burger exactly how you want it, they even ask how you like your meat cooked. Tried the Garlic fries, delicious. If you are near Post St San Francisco if is definitely worth a visit opposite the Beresford Arms Hotel

Yum!

Small place, but the burgers were great. I got the mini cheese and bacon burger. The mini was 1/4 pound and perfect size. The regular is 1/2 pound and looked fantastic. They have chili-cheese fries. I also had the "frings" which are onion rings and fries in the same basket. Cash only place but two mini burgers, drinks and a basket of frings was about $20. Worth it. 

Awesome Buffalo Burger!

This was my first time to SF. Before I left for my trip I read reviews about this restaurant. I must say this restaurant was one of my favorite places I dined at.I ordered the Buffalo Burger with cheese and fries--it was delicious and the price was reasonable. I will eat here again the next time I'm in SF. 

On point!
