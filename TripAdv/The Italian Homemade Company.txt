When we decided to eat here, based on the reviews on TA, we expected a full service restaurant. It's not!Although that was fine, we were a bit disappointed that they don't sell wine to enjoy with the wonderful pasta. The place is small and crowded, so one of you has to be vigilant watching for a table while the other stands in line to order. We ate on wobbly stools at the window.DH enjoyed his veggie lasagna and I enjoyed my gnochhi roll..It was a bit too much dough for me; I wouldn't order it again. An order of flat bread rounded out our order (nothing exciting)Oh, and you eat on disposable plates and bus your own table - just an fyi

All I had was 2 meatballs ($1.75 each). Came with sauce. If they make something as simple as meatballs the right way, then the rest must be good too. They make all their pasta right there. You can choose your type of pasta and sauce separately. Mix and match as you please. Can't wait to try the pasta.

What a great place to get a great Italian meal. The people are so nice and make you feel at home like you walked into your grandmothers kitchen. The food was delicious, we had the Gnocchi Roll gnocchi dough filled with spinach and ricotta. and the Cassoni with Italian Sausage, Bacon, Potatoes And Mozzarella Sandwich both were delicious. Generous portion size, we did not leave hungry. Wish we could have come back again during our visit.The have interior and outside seating, nice place for lunch or dinner.

6 ladies were looking forward to the meal here. We were lucky enough to arrive just in time to grab a table that fit us all. I didn't realize that you order your food and then come sit down...Pastas were fresh, wine was good. Service was wonderful. The flatbread was terrible. Seemed like a stale tortilla with some olive oil on top. I had fettucine with Italian sausage, and the sausage seemed homeade. Some of the girls had lasagna, and said it was excellent. Portions were generous.

It is a small Mom and Pop shop with a huge following. The line goes out the door for lunch or dinner. The food is all fresh, made from scratch and oh so good. The salad is large enough for two. The meals are good size portions, with fresh pasta and homemade sauce. We tried the lasagna and the special (linguini with sausage and eggplant). Both were outstanding. There aren't many tables, so you may have to wait for a seat. You place your order at the counter and the food is brought to you. They also do a large take out business. This is not fancy eating, but it is excellent eating.

We read all the awesome reviews and decided to give it a try. First of all, it's one of those places where you have to hope people don't linger after they are finished, or you won't have anywhere to sit - I did happen to notice a couple leaving when we were in line, so I sat while my husband ordered and then I noticed the sign that said you weren't supposed to do that - oh well, I did! The food was average at best. We have authentic italian where we live, and it is so much better than this. Plus - you pay $15+ for a meal served on a paper (Chinet) plate. Oh, and the "flatbread" is actually a tortilla shell with oil....

First my review concerns this companies Union Street branch which is in a more upmarket area reflected by its appearance as against the Columbus Avenue premises. This company as other reviews explain concentrates on serving up brilliant pasta dishes of gigantic proportions at a reasonable price. The restaurant appeals to younger customers who provide a vibrant buzz but older customers should not be put off you will pay a lot more for lesser quality. If you are from out of State you will certainly have a good memory.

Don't be put off by appearances, it's the food that counts!

We were looking for somewhere to grab some lunch in North Beach after exploring Lombard Street and we were told about this place. Without the recommendation I don't think we would have gone in. It looked a crowded cafe but when we tried the food we realised why it was crowded. It is an Italian restaurant run by Italians who love their food. The pasta is made fresh everyday and I don't think I've ever had a better tiramisu anywhere. So don't be put off by the paper plates and plastic cutlery. Just enjoy the food!

This restaurant was a short walk from our hotel, the San Remo, but in the opposite direction from Fisherman's Wharf. We wanted to get away from the bustle of the Wharf area and found this restaurant.

A no frills spot with unbelievably good homemade Italian pastas. Order at the register and take a seat. Food is brought to you, served on paper plates with plastic forks on tables with stools in the tiny dining room, but never mind that - focus on the food, made before your eyes in the open kitchen. This is the real deal - what an Italian grandmother would make for Sunday dinner.

We ordered some cold cuts as starters and 2 lasagnas plus tagliatelle pesto. Aside from the fact that they have no alcohol license (which is or widely mentioned anywhere), they don't take reservations, we had over 45' wait before we could sit down (on a Saturday) only to get both our main and starters served at the same time, and when we enquired about this we got: "I guess this is how it turned out!". The lasagna was large but tasteless Covered with supermarket cheese and the pasta was cold on arrival. Not nice food or service, we are not coming back and don't recommend it to anyone.

Based on the reviews we had high expectations. Pasta was ok but the sauces were bland and not impressive. We ordered the pesto and the bechamel and thought both were just ok. Needed lots of parmesan. My daughter ordered the meat lasagna and felt it was good enough. It is also not a pleasant dining experience since it is very small and everyone is on top of each other.

We happened upon this restaurant while walking on union street during our family vacation. It looked great so we came back in the evening for dinner. We absolutely loved this place. Fantastic food !! Burrata salad, fresh made pasta, bolognese and lasagna were great. Not expensive at all. You order at the counter and they bring to your table. Although we were traveling as tourists - we really try to find spots that are not super touristy and more local. This one hit the mark and I wish they had a location in North Carolina The service was great as well !!

Restaurants like Italian Homemade make me wish I lived in a bigger city like San Fran. We at at the Union St. location last week. We got there around 8:30 and hung around a few minutes for a table to open up. You order at the counter, help yourself to the water, and they bring the food to your table. I had the tagliatelle with meatballs, my son had the gnocchi pesto, and my wife had the gnocchi with marinara and a meatball. We were all delighted with the food. It came out quickly, was authentic (we were just in Italy in June!) and was properly cooked. The gnocchi was as fluffy as the best gnocchi we had in Italy. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!

You see them making the pasta as soon as you walk in to the restaurant. Small inside, with limited seating, but the food makes up for it! Go early, or an off time. It only took us about 10 minutes to get a table for a group of 4. The Bolognese sauce was delicious. The Buffalo mozzarella salad was delicious. The portions were large, and my wife and I split a salad, and could have done the same with our entrees, but she likes white sauce, and I like the red sauce. I highly recommend. Great ambiance, and delicious food. The staff were pleasant and very helpful.

If you're looking for a white tablecloth and fine wine experience, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for the best homemade pasta you've ever had, you've found it here. They make their pasta every day and you can look in the glass-door refrigerator to pick out your pasta. The Bolognese sauce is to die for. We had a nice salad also. You're served on paper plates with plastic forks and knives. They do not have beer or wine. With this said, it is an excellent dining experience. Get there early as they do not take reservations and fill up very fast. There are not many tables. Definitely worth the trip to experience their excellent food. There's a great Italian bakery on the corner from here

That just shows that it must be pretty darn good.

While taking a long long walk from Union Square to Coit Tower through North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf, we were starving at some point and went into the first casual restaurant we saw on Columbus. it turned out to be one of the best meals of our trip - very fresh, authentic Italian food (they didn't even have pepperoni on the menu!). I was not surprised when later I saw they were #6 of all restaurants in San Francisco. We had cassones and fettuccine, which were delicious, but we really wished we would have tried the tortellini!!! It looked very good. I was impressed with the young woman doing most of the cooking by herself in a tiny little kitchen...she even brought some of the food to the tables herself! The place is small and crowded but we were able to find a seat without any problems.

I was looking for an Italian place to grab my usual night before the race meal of pasta and tomato sauce. We picked this based on the reviews even though it was a bit out of the way. The restaurant is small and crowded. There was a steady flow of people through the door and all the seated were filled, but we liked the atmosphere. You could see all the food being prepared. While I really wanted to try a few items, I stuck to tagliatelle and bolognese. My husband got the lasagne. Mine was ok, nothing special. The lasagna was fantastic. One of the top 3 I've ever tasted. We ordered a tiramisu to split for dessert. Again, fantastic. It was the best I've ever had. While mine wasn't anything special, it wasn't bad and the other food made up for it, earning the 5 star rating. I'd definitely go back and try other options.

The Italian Homemade Company is a small local restaurant. We had walked by and saw some people eating outside a day before and thought it looked very good and was enough reason for us to give it a try. I went with my friend for dinner after seeing Beach Blanket Babylon. You order and get a number and food is delivered to the tables. It is kind of small and you might find it difficult to find seating. We had to wait a few minutes for some people to leave to get a seat. They also seem to do a great deal of takeout. The food is fresh and all the pasta is fresh and delicious. I had the Ravioli with meat sauce and two meatballs. A very nice portion and very good, but the meatballs were a little on the bland side. We split the salad of Tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on arugula. My friend had a pasta with Bolognese and meatballs. The prices are very reasonable and portions are nice sized. They do not serve alcholol. Give this local restaurant a try.

This is a small place which is more a take out rather than a place to sit in, but well worth seeking out. The pasta is all homemade and very good. The food is basic - choose pasta and sauce and add a small amount of side dishes - salad or flat bread. However the quality of the food is exceptional. Unfortunately they had run out of meatballs when we were there - but they looked immense! Doesn't serve alcohol, so not for you if you're looking for a boozy lunch! A lot of people were there for take outs.

I'm sure that somewhere, someone, makes some really good Italian food and brings it to this restaurant. I'm sure that somewhere, someone would like to see this restaurant prosper. None of those people were present when we went in to dine. The music was being played at such a high volume and definitely did not fit in with a dining atmosphere. The staff talked more with each other than the customers. They appeared to be bothered by us trying to order. At that point we left.

This small cafe has a limited menu featuring sandwiches and pastas. Everything is cooked to order using very fresh ingredients. All of the staff are Italian as are many of the customers. The prices are certainly reasonable by San Francisco standards. If no seating is available, make your order to go and eat in the interesting Washington Square Park that's steps away. If you have energy to spare, check out pretty Sts Peter and Paul Church where Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe tied the knot and/or walk up to Coit Tower for a photo opportunity.

Upon arrival in SF after almost 24 hours having passed since my last meal I decided to order from the Italian Homemade company and have it delivered to my hotel room. Would've preferred the actual dining experience, but was too tired to make the trek. The food was good just not extraordinary. I had the Papardelle with bolognese sauce and meatballs which was cooked well. The meatballs are huge. You definitely only need 1 or 2. The salad was plentiful and full of robust cherry tomatoes; However, they totally didn't give me the dressing I requested. Instead it was some type of olive oil based vinaigrette already dressing the salad. I asked for Caesar. Furthermore, they neglected to send me any eating utensils, which I also requested.Needless to say it's the small things that add up and can ultimately make or break the experience. At 30 plus dollars I was hoping to be a bit more wowed.

We read about this restaurant on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try. What an absolutely charming little restaurant and an excellent choice for our lunch. We were warmly greeted by Alicia, the owner who is from Bologna, Italy. This is a small restaurant with few tables and chairs, some counter seating and outside table seating. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. This is a simple restaurant. You eat off of disposable plates and cutlery. We decided to split a Fettuccine Bolognese. It was such a generous portion and perfect for us. The pasta was very fresh; the sauce thick and delicious. To compliment the pasta, we had a half order of Piadina (flatbread). While we were there, the area experienced a power outage. We were okay, as our food had just been delivered to us. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.

We loved this little restaurant! My mom who doesn't like to try anything actually enjoyed the meatballs my son ordered with his meal. We almost skipped this place because we thought it was just a store, but it is an amazing hole-in-the-wall restaurant. We would recommend a stop here. We loved it!!!

Absolutely Amazing!

Their bolognese sauce was really similar to the bolognese we ate just outside Vatican City in Rome. Absolutely delicious! We also tried their marinara sauce which was delicious as well. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!

Excellent quick pasta salads and more

Run by Italians this is genuine Italian pasta and salad bar. The seven different pastas are offered with a variety of sauces and are made to order. The quality is excellent and the speed and service is highly rated. I fully recommend for a fair and reasonably priced pasta. 

Fabulous!

Been travelling California for nearly a month and eaten so many burgers and steak so I fancied a change. I had the ravioli with a pesto sauce and my husband had the special pappardelle with wild boar. Both were delicious! True Italian food! They had side fridges where I think (not 100%) you could buy fresh pasta to take home and cook yourselves. Weirdly enough I liked the station where you put your plates and cutlery. Extra credit for the environment! Anyone who goes will know what I mean. I must also admit that Italian is not my first choice in cuisine but it was definitely what I wanted and thoroughly enjoyed it! 

Such great Italian food!

I grew up with my Nonno preparing Italian meals for our large family during special gatherings every year but as awesome a cook/chef he was, I never remember his noodlez tasting as fresh as they did here. Unbelievably good. The restaurant has limited seating, but when coupled with the wooden floors you feel as if you are walking into an Italian family kitchen. Just walk up to the register and order. As a side note, during our visit to another restaurant a few nights later, we had the opportunity to sit next to some local SF residents...when I asked them their favorite places to eat, The Italian Homemade was at the top of their list.

The Best Pasta Next to Nonna's!!!

The best pasta from an authentic Italian family!! This is a tiny no frills joint in the heart of Little Italy. Pasta is served on paper plates. The portions are hardy and more than delicious!! Tastes and smells like my Nonna's house on a Sunday afternoon!!!

Small place, very simple but very cozy. If wasn't for the big sign and bright red facade it would be hard to find. Lots of pasta options, sandwiches and salads, good amount of sauces, and ALL tastes delicious. The bolognese sauce is incredible, soooooo good. The fettuccine is very light and fresh.

Delicious food, friendly and fast service, I would be there all the time if I lived nearby... Sitting is very basic and limited, which only makes you appreciate the food even more.

Really good authentic Italian meal

This place is amazing - the energy is vibrant and filled with joy. The staff seemed all to be if Italian origin and the service was quick and kind. There was a short queue when we arrived but it took no more then 20 minutes before our food arrived. We had the most delicious spinach and ricotta filled tortellini with homemade tomato sauce and Parmesan. I'll go here again next time in SF

Yum

Hole in the wall place with wonderful pasta. Don't expect fancy frills; the food is served on paper plates, but it is definitely worth it. Get the lasagna. 

Fast and delicious.

Came for the lasagna but unfortunately they didn't have any available at opening. Ordered ravioli and pesto tortellini. Really good, portion ok maybe it was just so good we wanted more. Also ordered three different cassones. My favorite was the meatball one. Will try to make another trip so we can try the lasagna.

Amazing food!

This little nook had some of the best pasta I have tried outside of Italy. All of the pasta is homemade and cooked in a tiny unconcealed kitchen behind the till. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, once with a tomato and basil marinara sauce and once with a sage and butter sauce. Both times the food was absolutely exquisite. The seating is limited so I would recommend grabbing a table as soon as possible or ordering the food to-go.I highly recommend this spot to any pasta-lover craving a tasty and satisfying meal. This restaurant proves that dishes can be both simple and full of flavour.

True local gem!

What a great little restaurant! When you see the place, you are tempted to walk on by, but let your nose be your guide. The menu is limited, but the quality is excellent. We will stop by next time in SF. Trust the locals. 

Amazing little Italian place

After a long day of sightseeing we decided to stop at this small place. Is not fancy, looks really cozy. The lasagna was just amazing!!! Definitely worth a visit. Don't forget to clean after yourself! :)

Can't believe I am just reviewing this place now. My wife and I were in SF for my birthday in Feb and were looking for a place to grab a bite. We passed this spot and didn't think much but luckily turned around after walking a block past and decided to head back to try it. We decided to split a dish (which was a great call because the portions were huge) and ordered a wider noodle with meat sauce. Honestly one of the best pasta dishes I've had lately (and we just visited Florence recently). Super affordable, cool local vibe, and amazing food. Definitely recommend stoping in here if you are in SF and feeling like some pasta.

The food here was delicious! It was a great little find! It is a small place where you order at the counter where you choose the type of pasta and then a sauce to go with it. Yummy! 

Yes. It is very homemade

As the name if their restaurant, this place is legit and so good. The pasta is made fresh everyday and in front of your eyes. Most of the people that come here take the food to go since seating is very limited. PRO TIP: The staff here speaks mostly Italian so if you know any mighty as well speak it! 

Lovely place and food...

The place is cousy and handy-krafted pasta is amazing... delicious, good ingredients and nice service. If you go there, hand-made pasta is a must...

Good spot for your pasta fix

My partner and I decided on Italian since we were staying in Little Italy and checked out this spot. You can combine whichever pasta you like best with whichever sauce you think will go with it and voila! Dinner is served. Cool ambience and rapid service and turnover. Nice spot for a quick dinner or lunch.
