A disappointing meal after the hype: Definitely NOT the World's Best Burrito!" Not even in top 100.

The hype about it being the world's best Burrito, is what got me to search it out and try it! BUT, it set up such high expectations that disappointment was certain. But, if not the BEST it should have been good enough to be in top 10, or 100, or 1000? I felt it was an ordinary American Burrito with a giant Hype.Sorry to be this harsh, but, in a town like SF I expect much better!

Read about this place on TripAdvisor and decided to give it a try! Make sure to ask for El Dorado style which is flash grilled. So freaking amazing!!!! The line was a bit long but went super fast! I could not stop eating my Carne Asada Burrito, even though I was stuffed! If I ever come back to the Mission area, I will definitely stop in again!

The mexican food were nice, but the quantity was very small. Price are reasonable for the quality, but you can find cheaper places for the same quality of food and bigger portions. They do not have service at table, so you have to line up to order and pay at the cashier and then wait for your food to be prepared by the cookers.

My daughter and I stopped at this restaurant tonight. The place was packed with a line running out the door. We had to have our meals to go. We each had the super burrito, hers with chicken, mine with chorizo. Both were very good, very large and reasonable on price. Definitely ask for hot sauce.

I think what was the most unattractive about this place is how the lady in the register didn't have any customer manners! There was a baby girl who had been chocking and she didn't want to call an ambulance even though the parents were very frustrated and asked them to do so. She just kept telling the employees to give the baby some water. She didn't want the commotion in her restaurant and had made a comment of how busy they are all the time because of how great they are. It's one taco for $6-9 the tortilla isn't even warm and it's just average. Cash only. A skeptical place. Again it was their demeanor of being too good and not doing as the customer requested that turned me off.

No idea what all the rave is about, we ate the vegi taco and vegi burrito with the chips guac and salsaGood amount of food for the priceThe food was very very bland, wouldn't go out of my way to eat here and wouldn't recommend wasting one of your SF meals here when there is amazing fair priced 5 star places within a block. Guac and salsa was good.... maybe the meat is amazing but we didn't taste any of it. Go to Garcia madre instead!!!

Went here because two friends from San Francisco recommended it. Can see it gets lots of business as there was a long queue and we had to order takeout - not a problem. However, staff rushed us and they make the food so quickly that it seems they put quantity above quality. The food was oily, bland and they put cheese on my vegan friends taco when she specifically asked them not to. Won't be going back as am very disappointed with the quality of service and food.

Our HomeAway host recommended this to us, supposedly voted the best burrito in the world. Not sure I'd go that far but the burritos were very good. We had had a long day seeing the City and were looking for good takeout options for dinner. When we got here (about 7:30) the line wrapped all the way through the restaurant and out the door, but they moved us through pretty quickly and efficiently. Recommended!

I'm assuming the reason this is the top Mexican restaurant in SF is because all locals have voted it to be so? IMO, far from authentic Mexican Food as it tasted very bland and generic to what you would associate with a good Mexican Taco, Quesadilla or Burrito, which is what I had. However my friends who had tacos and quesadillas also said the same so approach with caution!One thing that surprised us was how busy the place was, it was absolutely heaving with customers either queuing to buy, waiting to collect food or sitting down and eating. We waited 10 minutes in the queue and a further 10 minutes for our food so that should give you a rough idea of what to expect. I'd give it a solid 6/10!

We landed at SFO ravenously hungry and decided to check out the Mission District to find some good food. Found this place thanks to Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed! It is cash only so go prepared or get cash at their ATM. We ended up going back another day before we left. The line was long both times but we still got our food quickly. Among our group of 4 we ended up trying chicken, chorizo, pork, and beef head tacos and they were huge and insanely good and packed with an incredible amount of flavor! They obviously use fresh ingredients and it comes through in the flavor of the food. I would definitely recommend this place!

It's quite a way out from downtown. Ride costed about $16 on Uber. Well worth the ride! We ordered a chicken quesadilla (super with guacamole, salsa, sour cream & cheese), ox tongue taco and beef burrito. Ordered seconds, an additional beef quesadilla with cheese. The tongue was a bit too gamey for us. Everything else was just awesome. The hot sauce is da bomb!

Traveled to SF during the record setting heat wave and decided to have lunch here upon the recommendations of so many other reviewers. Apparently, we weren't the only ones with this idea as the lunch line on a Saturday afternoon stretched out the door. Extreme heat + a long line of impatient customers = stressed out staff as they tried their best to feed the hungry hoards as fast as possible. In their rush, the beef tacos we ordered were sloppily put together and they forgot my order of nachos & drink. On the positive side the tacos were generously sized, the salsa for the nachos was delicious, and it was overall a good value for the price. On a different day I can see this place being a 4/5 but "The best tacos ever?" I don't think so. Still if you're set on checking out the hype do your best to visit during off-peak hours.

We went to La Taqueria on a friend's recommendation and wasn't disappointed. Amazing value for money, fast and friendly service, really high quality ingredients, and food prepared with soul. The meat was succulent and toppings really flavourful. The burrito was very wet but this only made it even more of a fun and hands on eating experience. This is definitely a casual dining experience and the atmosphere in the restaurant is buzzy and friendly.By far the best burritos we had ever tasted - 100% recommended! Make sure to ask for the burrito to be grilled - the extra crispy skin makes it even more delicious.

This restaurant is cash only. It is in the Mission District so you may have to park a couple of blocks away and walk. There will be a line. The line moves quickly, they have people taking orders as you wait in line. At the end of the line, you pay the cashier and get your number. Finding a place to sit may be a challenge with all the people there. Once you get your tacos and/or burrito it will be worth the wait. The meat in the tacos were soft and juicy. The guacamole and pico de gallo were expertly made and very fresh. These were some of the best tacos and burritos we have ever had. The burrito is a good size and makes a satisfying lunch for one person.

It absolutely lives up to the hype -- the long snaking line to place, the order and the mad scramble to score seating felt completely worth it when we tasted the food.There is a freshness and authenticity to the Mexican food that is rare even in the Bay area. I appreciated that the burritos are not stuffed with rice.If I was not so pressured by the crowds I would have lingered more over the menu and ordered something unusual like the lengua which was also listed.

Don't believe the hype.

Among Lonely Planet's top 5 restaurants apparently, but doesn't live up to it. Full of people at lunch time so ended up with a rushed, sloppy, dripping burrito. The worst thing though is the neighbourhood, we walked through tramps and drug addicts to get there, and it's hard to find seating so you're left in a noisy dirty street. Cheap though.

I heard a lot of good stuff of La Taqueria, I'm not from San Francisco and this was probably the only chance I had to go. I had to walk 30 minutes to get there. I arrive 20:50 and one of the waiters/service (Mariela) told me I couldn't order because they were closing (No sorry, no apologizes nor explanations)I told her that their closing hour was in ten more minutes (in fact, they even had that information on their door) and that I had to walk 30 minutes to get there, and that I wasn't from San Francisco... she didn't minded. I asked her if she could speak with her manager before giving me a final answer because I was very upset and said to her that was going to put a bad review of the restaurant.... she didn't minded. In fact she told me that she was following directs orders from the manager and that the manager was the owner's son.I have been to a lot of restaurants in my life and have made a lot of reviews on tripadvisor and strongly believe that any place that treats his costumers like that, doesn't worth going, even if they have the best tacos in town (allegedly)

I don't know if I would call this the countries best burrito but it was a very good one. They key here is to ask for everything fried. It produces a great crispy exterior that enhances the flavor nicely. We ordered a carne asada taco, carnitas burrito and chicken quesadilla. We got everything super as well which I would say is a must. My favorite meat was the carne asada it was super flavorful. If I could've made any changes I would've done everything carne asada. The carnitas got lost in all that was in the burrito so I didn't really taste that. The chicken was very moist and juicy. There are usually lines here but they move rather quickly. There may be better spots in the city but if your visiting it's a great place to try.

Super great, as always! Here's the deal: find the end of the line and join the queue--it moves quickly. Survey the menu and figure out what you want (don't worry, you can't go wrong) asap because a waitress may take your order before you reach the front of the line. Remain in the line and pay when you reach the cashier. Try not to ask complicated questions and always tip extravagantly. Credit cards are not accepted but there is an atm at the back of the restaurant on the left hand side. After you pay for your food, take your receipt, note the number and have a seat. Be patient, your number will be called in 5 or 10 minutes. Because the owner personally oversees the restaurant (he's the gentleman with the moustache, wrapping your tacos and calling your number), you'll always experience friendly service, fast-moving lines and the fantastic food that makes this THE place to get your Mission-style burritos and tacos. I usually order chicken tacos with avocado and whole pinto beans. Don't expect deep-fried corn tortillas--they're steamed and soft, not crispy, unless you order crispy tortillas (a special not on the menu). Ask for some pico de gallo (finely-chopped fresh tomato and onion) and douse your tacos (and everything else) with La Taqueria's spicy salsa verde (green sauce), which appears to be tomatillo-based. This dinner is my idea of comfort food heaven. When I really want to go wild, I get the carnitas (shredded pork) tacos, which are savory, salty, porky and addictive. My husband gets the carne asada burrito with black beans and avocado and a melon drink. La Taqueria's burritos are big, but not the gigantic log-like burritos served up in other taquerias because they're pared down to the essentials, not loaded with rice and gloppy sauces. If the line is out the door, simply walk to Mission Pie (the Mission's best-kept secret), a few feet away at the corner of Mission and 25th Streets, and have a beer and a very different and delicious lunch or dinner, such as pork with green chile over brown rice, with steamed greens, followed by banana cream pie. Or try Old Jerusalem, a middle eastern restaurant across the street, one block down, between 25th and 26th. You can't go wrong in this part of the hood.

We visited this place based on feedback from TripAdvisor and local info. It did not disappoint.

We had a chicken burrito and a beef burrito and added chips with salsa and guac. Upon recommendation from a local, I tried an aguafresca in mango and it was so delicious. Be prepared...this place is packed and you will probably share a table with folks and make new friends! If possible, get someone in your party to find a table while someone else waits in line. The menu is limited to burrito, taco, quesadilla and then you pick your meat and any extra fillings. The regular size is plenty big to fill you up!

Really good carne asada burrito - as others mention get it grilled. Had a great green sauce on the table as well, but m'lady bemoaned the lack of a salsa bar. Quality of meat exceeded some other places I've been, but I'm going to be honest (based on very extensive burrito experience) - there's lots of places slanging nearly identical product. There was a line before they opened and the whole time we were there which made it very claustrophobic and not very enjoyable to eat inside - I'd take it to go if I wine back. Strawberry and watermelon aguas frescas were superb!

Having never been to San Francisco, a stop at a Mexican restaurant was a must on a recent trip. La Taqueria was mentioned a number of times by various websites and reviewers for having the best burritos in the area so a stop here seemed to be the right choice. I visited for lunch and the place was pretty crowed but not unbearable. The line to order wrapped around the entire interior of the restaurant and those who had already ordered stood around awkwardly between the tables waiting for a seat to open. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to place my order and about another 5 minutes to get the food. I ordered the Chips & Salsa and a Burrito with Carne Asada. The Chips & Salsa was a little disappointing. The Salsa was a little soggy like it had been sitting around for a bit but still had a decent flavor. The burrito was enjoyable and filled with freshly grilled chunks of Carne Asada, tender pinto beans, crisp lettuce, creamy avocado, and sour cream.

Considering that this is #1 on TripAdvisor for Mexican in San Francisco, a town with loads of great Mexican restaurants, I expected more. I had a beef super burrito and it wasn't very tasty. Not bad, but not memorable. And the place is a mad house, no tables available, hot and noisy. We had to walk down Mission St and sit in front of the Metro station. It was more than $10 for a burrito. And then all they have are fountain drinks for soda's. I probably won't be back.

We made sure to get there at opening time at 11am, as even during the weekday the line starts to form 15 minutes or so before the gates open. I can only imagine how busy they get on the weekends. We ordered 2 of the carne asada tacos and one of their famous carne asada burritos (Tip: get then "dorado style" or grilled, adds even more to the texture and flavor. ) Both the tacos and burritos came loaded with the tender signature carne asada and lots of guacamole and sour cream per request. It's also fun to get a seat outside, through the window you can watch the crew make the tacos and burritos and chop up the carne asada as you eat. Even if you get there during peak hours the lines move fairly quickly and are a mix of locals and out of town tourists who have heard about the famous burritos from Travel Channel or an online competition they won.

Love the mango agua fresca and the carne asada taco with avocado or thr burrito. Service is always quick--even when there's a line. Worth the wait. (Love the Italian bakery next door too for an almond torte!)Very well priced. An absolute SF gem

The BEST in the west. We go every few weeks when we can't stand it anymore and need our fix. Carnitas anything is also the bomb. Sorry no pictures because we eat it so quick.

Best Burrito in America (possibly anywhere)

If you're in San Fran don't miss out on La Taqueria. I went with some buddies and we did our research beforehand on the best thing to get, which we confirmed with our own trip there: a carne asada super burrito dorado style (meaning they grill the burrito and get the outside a bit crunchy). Definitely the right thing to get. Long wait out the door, even at 3 pm, but you won't regret it. Horchata and fruit smoothies and also incredible.

Good experience, crowd was big but the line moved quickly. Food was delicious and fresh. Nothing fancy, just decent Mexican food from a local institution. 

Wait in the line! Worth it!

This was one of the highlights of our trip. The food was delicious ! It's cash only and there tends to be a line but it goes by quickly and it is totally worth it. I had their burrito and couldn't get enough. The portions are huge so be warned. A can't miss!!

This noon was well-spent. We were second in line as La Taqueria opened at 11:00. The ordering system is tried and true, and we had our lengua (tongue) super burrito ($10.90) in six minutes.One super can feed two, knowing that our dessert is just a minute away at Mission Pie.The burrito was just as delicious as I remembered. Its rating is justified.

Superb. Unquestionably the best burrito.

Read all the reviews you want to find the best burrito in SF. Nearly all will list La Taqueria in the list. Droning on about the others may give bloggers and reviewers something to do and sell, but I can save you some time and trouble--this is the real deal.The accumulated wisdom here is spot on; a must-have is the carne asada burrito with cheese and guacamole and, don't overlook this, ask for it to be grilled. That and a Negra Modelo is heaven. Try it.

Fresh, filling, fantastic

I went to La Taqueria on Cinco De Mayo right before closing and only had to wait maybe 15-20 minutes before ordering and getting a table - got the carnitas and chicken tacos. It was absolutely amazing. Worth the wait. Best tacos I've had in a very long time, if not ever!!!

Great buritod

A bit long queue and took awhile, but the food was worth it. The burito was delicious and you can customize it! In the restorant you can smell bleach... so we took away and ate in the park. 

Delicious! Exactly what it should be, every time!

Tasty Carnita Burrito. Don't forget to ask them to grill your tortilla. It is not standard but it is really delicious.

Simply the best.

I am a vegetarian and so finding a good and satisfying burrito can be challenging. My buddy took me to La Taqueria and I am so glad that he did. The place was packed and had a line out the door. I ordered a veggie burrito, which consists of beans, cheese, salsa, and hot sauce, and chips and guacamole. They are a machine there. My food came quickly and my friend and I had to move quickly to find a place to eat. The burrito and guacamole were tasty and I walked out of there, fat and happy, without much of a dent to my wallet.

My wife and I stopped here after hearing about this place on Trip Adviser. The flank steak tacos were very good. Great assortment of hot sauces. Good value too.. under 10 bucks for two beers and a couple of tacos. Highly recommend..

Cheap and cheerful

Went pretty late after a night bar hopping in Mission. Average burritos and slightly better tacos but nothing worth making a special trip. If you're already in the neighbourhood and hungry, drunk or both, this is likely to appeal.

Our kids told us to try this spot. Neat little hole in the wall in the Mission. Food is excellent. Would recommend giving it a go.

A bit of a wait, but solid burritos!

Went on a weekday lunch - pretty much a full house with stacked queues. Decided on the lengua - beef tongue burritos on a friend's recommendation. Even though its put together on a line, the meat is still succulent and juicy. Pico de gallo's fresh, guacamole's made from sweet, rich avocado and the coriander (or cilantro, depending on where you're from) is fresh and zingy.While you're down in Mission checking out the murals and the handicrafts, definitely make a stop here.

Awesome carne asada supreme burritos!

It was well worth the wait. We arrived around 2 pm and the line was outside of the inner area. The line moved very fast and we ordered while in line. We had part of our group sit at a table to hold a spot which turned out to be a great idea. I ordered a mineral water and the carne asada supreme burrito. WE also split the chips and salsa. Both were very very tasty. The burrito was one of the best i have ever had. The owner noticed my Chicago cubs hat and mentioned he would be visiting Chicago soon for an award they won. He was extremely friendly and made it feel like a loving and well managed restaurant.

I will never eat another burrito ever until I have this again. The flavor is so amazing. The way they grill the tortilla. This place is on point. Not fancy. Super crowded but man they know what they are doing. 

Overhyped taqueria with long line ups and waits

We were lured to this restaurant by the great reviews and recommendations, and perhaps we tried the wrong menu items, but we were very disappointed. We waited at least 30 minutes in line and for the food, and the two burritos we got were fairly bland and watery because of the sauce. My vegetarian burrito was mostly of pinto beans and a little bit of salsa. Perhaps it would have been better to try their taco or their "super" burrito with cheese and avocado. Overall, it seemed there was nothing special about the food to make it worth the hype and wait and we were sadly disappointed.

Excellent Burrito, but the ordering process could be improved

We were looking forward to our visit here and felt that the food did not let its reputation down. Its also excellent for vegetarians. We both had the super burrito option and very much enjoyed it. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the line to order takes a little time and can be confusing. They give you an order number and then you sit around and wait for it to be called, but its difficult to hear as its so loud in there. Also we ordered a drink and they only gave us the food with the order number but left the drink separately on another part of the counter. I just had to guess which one was mine from the size and colour and then take it as the staff were too busy to care!
