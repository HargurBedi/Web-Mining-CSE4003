We had booked this place 3 months in advance and even then could only book a table for 9pm. However our hotel recommended we turn up at 1630 when it opens and we would get an earlier table. We did , we waited a little bit but was still seated earlier than our initial booking and it was worth the wait. Excellent food and service (I think by Kelly) Deffo would come back and deffo worth a visit.

I went here once with work friends, as a big group, we had a reservation several months in advance. I'm not sure if you need to think that far ahead, but it's definitely worth it. We had a few cocktails, and everyone enjoyed the meal.There's no parking other than valet; we took public transit/walked from work/took car services to get there, and it was no problem. I hear you can sometimes just walk in as a single person and eat at the bar, but I've yet to try this out. This review only let me fill out a review as far back as last November, but I believe I was there earlier in 2016.

If you eat meat you should check it out- Its not for Vegetarians, Vegans, and the like.I love veggies and have a huge garden, all organic. BUT this is a great place for all of us who grew up in the 50's and 60's. Its delicious and you have to be hungry and in the mood for some rare prime rib. The menu is Yorkshire pudding, ( yummy bread) and creamed spinach which is so good you cant believe it. Yummy real mashed potatoes, and the PRIME RIB- A big cart goes by and you choose your cut of meat. The ambiance is so sweet and old school. Think Frank Sinatra supper club. I love this place still.

This is hands down the best meal I have ever eaten. Reservations book up several weeks in advance. I tried to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance and the only thing available was a 10:00 pm reservation which we didn't book. We decided to just go one night knowing that there would be a long wait. I was expecting to have to wait 2 hours. When we got there the host said the wait was 4 hours!! I asked if we could eat at the bar and was told yes and to go ask the bartendar to put our names on his list. The bar wait was 45 minutes to an hour and a half. I think we waited about an hour and were seated at the bar. If you sit at the bar they just bring what you order out to you already on the plate. You don't get the person coming around and cutting your meat for you at the table. The prime rib is so delicious it just melts right in your mouth. I don't even like spinach and the creamed spinach was on of the best things I have ever tasted. I definitely recommend this place. I just wish there were more locations.

Asked our hotel for a good rib restaurant; I was meaning a rack of ribs.Managed to get a table in a very busy restaurant at 7pm to find a menu only serving roast beef!An English cut with baked potato and spinach and a pre salad.The roast was very thin and had a lot of fat.It wasn't great and was surprised why the restaurant was so busy and popular.My home made Sunday roasts are just as good!

We were to be in San Fran for one nice meal, our first trip to CA, and chose this restaurant. I was warned from reviews that they tended to rush their service,so thought I was prepared. The meal was absolutely delicious, probably the best goriness rib we've had, but the first impression was not a good one--We ordered 2 glasses of wine, which did not come until my husband had completely finished his salad! I stalled, waiting on the wine, and when I first asked the server, upon delivery of the salads,her excuse was that the bar was really busy the first 15 min of opening. Seriously? 1) Why aren't the diners either served first, or why isn't there a bartender dedicated to get their drinks in a timely manner?2)I feel pretty sure there is an open bottle of Zinfandel at the bar, that anyone could quickly pour into 2 glasses- it wasn't as if we had ordered mixed drinks.Management- please do something (as suggested above), to improve table service!! If it wasn't for this, I would have given top rating.

Vegans and vegetarians need not apply. Prime rib is their thing and they do it well. The house cut was plenty for me and was prepared perfectly. The sides, particularly the Yorkshire pudding, were very good, but the star was the prime rib. The prime rib is cut to order at your table from a cart, which will sometimes involve a wait, but totally worth it. No one in our party had room for dessert. Pricey, but again, worth it. Reservations highly recommended.

Outstanding Food, shame about the service.

First let me say you won't be disappointed with the food, the beef is out of this world and the best we have had.But..... the whole meal felt incredibly rushed by the staff and when you're paying those kind of prices you expect your dining experience to last a little longer than a fast food meal. Also, the whole over the top theatrical thing was annoying. Like my review heading says, the food was incredible but let down badly by the service which left us feeling a little disappointed.

We took our son here for a birthday dinner. We had booked a table for gone 9pm, but went early and waited for a slot and managed to eat around 8. The place was heaving, this was a Wednesday night. The meal is very theatrical. We had a tossed salad to start, which the waiter prepares in front of you. Then someone rocks up with a metal cart full of beef, which is served to the desired level of pinkness. They do one thing here and do it well. Between us we had the English cut and the prime rib, which came with creamed spinach and big Yorkshire puddings. After the meat feast we could not manage dessert. It was not cheap, but certainly a highlight of our trip.

For meat eaters, House of Prime Rib is a must! My wife and I dined here on a Saturday night in August and we had a memorable meal. The menu is really simple, with prime rib or "fresh fish," and not much else. The prime rib comes with a salad -- the house dressing is fantastic -- warm bread, your choice of potato, and Yorkshire pudding. The prime rib is expertly prepared tableside, and is juicy and flavorful. The sides are the perfect accompaniments to the meal. Service is attentive, but not annoyingly so.Here's a not-so-well kept secret: if you order the House of Prime Rib cut, they'll even bring you another slice if you're still hungry!

It's become a yearly event to dine here now. It's great to start with a cocktail, but here it's more like two cocktails because they give you the shaker with plenty more to drink.Menu is easy, pick a cut and the sides and the rest of pure indulgence. You can even have seconds, I did.You probably want to make a reservation, it's very popular.

We had a large party, 12 people, with reservation. We were seated very close to on time. It was tight but the food and service were outstanding. This was my first time and everyone recommended the biggest slice. I went for the medium option and still had leftovers. All of my companions (men) did manage to finish everything though!! I tried both the spinach and the corn, but preferred the corn. Great place, excellent food and service.

As the name of the restaurant suggests, come for the Prime Rib. If you are looking for something else, go somewhere else. Hands down the best prime rib, creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding, mashed potato and gravy, and the salad is delicious too! I can't comment on the desserts, because if I happen to have a little extra room, I get the second cut(thin cut in addition to first serving). The service can sometimes be a little slow, but there is nothing wrong with slowing down to savor this particular meal.

This establishment is amazing! I have been dining here since i was a young boy, now bringing my family, friends and business associates. They are doing the right thing right, Prime Rib and only Prime Rib (they do have one seafood entree for the unfortunate person that can't or won't eat beef). The menu is simple, chose the cut of beef you want (from thin slices to "beef on the bone", then chose your side dish (creamed spinach or corn) and mashed or baked potato. That's it, It's served with their fantastic salad with house dressing prepared table side, house baked bread, corn bread sticks and Yorkshire Pudding.One of the best parts is what my wife calls the "Zeppelins". These are custom made carving carts that have been there since they first opened in the 1940's. The Chef wheels the cart to your table, opens the lid and exposes multiple roasts and carves your beef to order in front of your eyes !! If you have room for desert, its a nice menu plus a full old style bar and wine cellar.The wait staff are all professional and well trained. They have multiple floor Managers that have been there for years that insure you are treated like a King!One warning, if you want a reservation, make it well (months) in advance. If you are a small party you can generally get in as a walk in right when they open at 5:30 but after that you may end up waiting.

In a City with truly great restaurants, House of Prime Rib is a front runner. This is where the locals go. The decor, ambiance, and take your breath away quality of their prime rib is second to none. In classic style, with cuts of prime rib to match your appetite, from petite to cattle baron, the outstanding quality of the beef, along with their simple side dishes of creamed spinach (without nutmeg, hmm) baked potatoes and others, it is truly a satisfying pleasure.The decor reminds you of San Francisco decor at the turn of the 20th Century. But, you feel at home. Reservations are a must. You will delight in the food and ambiance.

With a waiting period of a month for reservations and being called the best place to get prime rib in the state/city/country, I expected a LOT. I liked the menu. It was simple and to the point. The atmosphere was awful. It was insanely loud, like I couldn't have a conversation because it was seriously way too loud to speak without yelling. The food was ok. Nothing special. I've had food of the same caliber at, say, the Yard House or BJ's. Service was not great. Took probably a half hour longer than needed because the server was taking so long. Would not go again. The food was ok, but I expected more.

This restaurant is among the top 5 places I have eaten in my life. Everything including the atmosphere, service and food was top notch. We sat at a table toward the end of the restaurant near the fireplace. The restaurant has vintage booths and a few tables. The waiter was true old school. He explained the menu and gave us his opinion on wine choices. He gave us samples of 2 wines we were thinking about trying. The dinner starts with a spinning bowl salad made at the table - warm bread was also served. Great dressing - salad served at the correct temperature, included a chilled plate and fork. Then the main course - there was a domed cart (old school) in each room of the restaurant that contained the prime rib and all side dishes. A chef cut our prime rib and prepared our plate. I had rare and it was perfect. The dinner came with creamed spinach, a perfectly baked potato with all the fixings, and a corn stick. A selection of 3 heat levels of horseradish was placed at the table. Excellent is the only way to describe this dinner.

I have been to HOP a couple of times and have always loved it. I always sit at the bar because I can never get a reservation. This time, as I was eating my lovely meal, I looked at the space between the soft part of the bar where you rest your hands and arms and the solid part where you set your glasses and I noticed at least a months worth of old food particles stuck in there. The old pieces of food from hundreds of diners before me ranged in size from a pea to a grain of sand and everything in between. My plate was sitting directly on top of this thin line of distracting disgustingness that ran the entire length of the bar. I might expect this yuckiness at a diner serving me a $3.99 breakfast but not at a San Francisco institution such as HOP! Please clean this up so I can enjoy my meal without looking at the rotting fallen leftovers of diners before me!

This is not a normal experience for us but wanted to share it in case the proprietors every care to check. Last Saturday I was in town on business and took a business associate and his wife to HOPR. I always take them here when I am in town as this is my favorite restaurant in the country. My wife and I fly to SF just to eat here at least once a year.This time, however, was not the normal fantastic gastronomical experience. All three of us ordered medium rare prime rib. Each of us received an medium/medium well piece. As I am a bit more vocal, I asked for a new cut and received a rare replacement piece. I had given up at this point and just toughed through it. My associate's wife didn't even eat hers. At the end of the meal I mentioned this to the waiter and he just said he would talk to the chef. I very underwhelming response and experience. Considering I am from out of town and my love of HOPR is so deep my expectations are always high when I sit down to enjoy the superb salad, those divine mashed potatoes and gravy and the mouth watering prime rib. To have this experience when I am only able to visit HOPR once or twice a year was very disheartening.

Finally got to try out House of Prime Rib on our recent trip to Cali. Food is delicious and very reasonably priced...the entree cost includes salad as well as a variety of sides. One thing I especially enjoyed is that meal included yorkshire pudding, which is a must for me whenever having prime rib. Service was also wondering - staff were friendly and attentive, always checking in on us despite us going on a very busy Saturday evening. Would definitely come again when in town.

Went to San Francisco for holiday in July and went to the restaurant with local friends. The restaurant served high quality of prime rib that I have ever tasted. The prime rib was so tender and tasty. The meat is of beautiful pink color. I ordered the biggest size, King Henry cut, and after that I was full and decided to skip the desert. It is worth for value. I would definitely go back if I go to San Francisco again.

Third time coming here, might be the last. Bad service, bottom line. Overpriced for what you get.1) Father-in-law ordered a Beefeater gin gibson, but it never arrived (all of the other cocktails were delivered... then he had to remind server about his order)2) Creamed spinach was not delivered with my meal (any reason why? No, just an apology once they realized they were in the wrong...) So, that was two missing order items in a row not being delivered3) There is ZERO reason to order the larger (Henry VIII) portion. I was the only person at the table who ordered that, and yet "Chef Carlos" actually served me a SMALLER portion of meat than anybody else at the table. What I DID get was a large-ish BONE attached to my smaller piece of meat. My wife (who ordered the regular cut) got a much larger slab of meat. But, hey, since I ordered the large size, I got a big bone attached to my smaller cut... maybe they should change the name of that cut to "King Henry's Dog"?They did give me an offer of a second cut (which I took advantage of, since they skimped on my first), but they also offered the others a second slice, as well... so there is zero reason to pay extra for the Henry VIII cut... don't do it!!! Have to give +1 star, though, for the fact that the meat is pretty darn good (and so is the sourdough bread they serve before the meal), and the cocktails are a good deal (they bring you a whole shaker of it, so really it's like you get 2 cocktails for the price of one)But for $50 per person, yes I expect cuts to match what was ordered, and I expect to not have to keep reminding the waitress to bring the missing items we ordered...

Our family was looking for a good steak house. Saw this on trip advisor. Upon calling the restaurant they were fully booked for dinner. We asked if they could give us an earlier booking which they did. Really happy that we go to try this place. Our whole family enjoyed the food. Their prime rib was really good. Its the best I've tried so far. After you finish dinner, the server will ask you if you want an extra serving free of charge. My dad and I had another slice because it was so good. Will definitely eat here again when we go back to SF next year.

food, ambiance and value is five stars, service is not.it's really worth the trip even with the difficulty to get reservations. the prime rib really is outstanding. you won't have to spend much time analyzing the menu, there's basically just different sizes of prime rib and you can a few options for sides. the Yorkshire pudding is legit. I visit London frequently and we were with guests from England so this dinner was like a Sunday roast. they they loved everythingwine list is pretty good and fairly priced (relative to normal restaurant markup)it's a decent value considering the reputation and food quality. entrees were around $45 and included sides and saladservice was really lacking. I get that it's pretty much a factory, serving everyone the same dish, but presumably every diner was there for a special occasion and the guests are treated as coach class tickets on a budget airline. Our two servers (one in training?) were clearly bored with their jobs, talking to us from a memorized script and no other interaction. it was really disappointing, especially since our guests had been looking forward to this meal for months. just a little bit of effort from our servers would have made this a truly outstanding experience.some restaurants don't rest on their laurels, they constantly strive to earn their reputation every day, with every meal. sadly, HoPR will continue to pack them in because the food is great and it's an institution, but they're not a five-star restaurant. they've lost that world-class glow

I am not generally big fan of prime ribs, more into beef filet mignon and lamb, but this is special place. My local SF friends/colleagues took me there, and I was blown away. Beware: you need reservations well in advance, only my well connected friend was able to get us in the same day, but it was Monday, and 5:30 pm. the place was buzzing, noisy, and very busy when we arrived at 5:20. Wow, what an experience! Perfect service, yummy salad (and I am not a big salad eater at all), great and juicy prime rib, totally awesome creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and what an Yorkshire pudding.

If you eat....and especially if you eat meat... you must try HOPRs prime rib. You go there for that...nothing else! And you come back for more. That's what makes it great.What's amazing is that it is actually reasonably priced for what you get. So much food to go around that there is no way you are leaving hungry. All the cuts are great but my preference is the HOPR original cut and the thin cut; seconds make it even better. I must also mention the Martinis ... they give you the shaker so it's almost 2 doses. Unbelievable. Reservations are a must for large groups but here is a hint.....if you get there before they open you can get your name on first come first serve list. I've been lucky and got groups of 3 into dinner as long as you are willing to get there about 20 min before first seating. You may have to wait a few minutes before they seat you but the martinis help pass the time. Cheers to a great meal with friends and family!!

This restaurant has the Best Prime Rib, hands down. They have different cuts of Prime Rib, thick cut/bone in, or thin cut. And if you finish your order, they will give you another piece, even though it's a thinner piece...it is still a free piece of Prime Rib.

When I want to celebrate a special occasion this is the place I want to be. I should be embarrassed I have been coming here so long. It is tried and true, great food with lovely service. The price has increased but for all you get, it is still fair. Yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach with a huge slab of Prime Rib is the best. If you can make reservations that is the best but if not be prepared for a 2 hour wait. Still worth it. I was just there and I'm ready to go back.

Best prime rib I have ever had (I hope my wife doesn't read this)...Very affordably priced for what you get. I would suggest that you ask the waiter to only put half the salad dressing on your salad.Drinks are also very reasonable.Restaurant is on a very busy street during commute hours so allow extra time if you are trying to get to a Friday night reservation. (If you can get one)If you are visiting San Francisco this is a must visit restaurant!

Any trip to House of Prime Rib is a good one. You need to go with an empty stomach and a hearty appetite for incredible prime rib. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!The salad is great and such a cool presentation at your table and it's fun to have the meat carved right next to you. Reservations are tough to get, but if there are only a few of you, plan to get there right when they open and after having a drink at the bar, you'll be able to sit fairly quickly.You can never go wrong here, unless you're not a meat eater!

We ate at 'HOPR' as a belated family Father's Day meal. My husband is a real prime rib lover so this was a 'destination restaurant' for us. This iconic restaurant is not for everyone though....willingness to have prime rib is a must!! Portions are extremely generous and the price includes house salad (assembled table-side), warm sourdough bread, creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and baked or mashed potatoes, along with prime rib served from a beautiful old-style carving station. The entire dining experience here feels like a return to an older era....definitely fun for a change, but not a place we would choose to go often because of the size of the portions (ginormous!) and limited menu choice. (Wine list was also fairly limited.) My husband really loved it, and the experience of taking him here as a surprise made for a special family evening.

We originally had booked at 10pm at night because it was Mothers Day weekend. We called the restaurant and was able to get in at 5:30. Upon arriving we were immediately sat and greeted. The thing I loved about this place is that they specialize in one thing and do it incredibly. The atmosphere was awesome. It was just as I had envisioned it. Our waiter explained the process and gave us some suggestions on the cut of prime rib that we would like the most. I love the fact that this is an institute that has been in San Francisco for years and decades with an old school feel. It made it one of the most memorable anniversary dinners we have had. If we come back to San Francisco we will definitely be back.

My husband made the reservation 1 year in advance to celebrate his birthday at the House of Prime Rib. Our adult grandchildren met us there. We hadn't been there for many years & we were somewhat disappointed. Our table was ready when we got there & our server was friendly. We all ordered the Henry VIII cut because it was the only cut guaranteed to be "on the bone". The salad appeared to be from a bag of iceberg lettuce with a few julienne beets & bacon bits from a jar. The sever spins the stainless steel salad bowl inside a larger plastic bowl of ice while he dumps on the dressing, then plates it & serves it. It had enough dressing that it was almost soggy & nothing special. (Years ago a real Cesar was prepared table side). Our grandchildren had mashed potatoes & we had loaded baked potatoes. We all enjoyed our potatoes. (The baked potato had the same bacon bits as the salad). Some of us had creamed corn & some creamed spinach. To me the creamed corn tasted like it came from a can. The creamed spinach was good, but again had the same flavor of bacon bits! Yorkshire pudding was OK. The bread served with the salad received rave reviews from our G-Kids, but I didn't eat any knowing I was having a huge piece of prime rib! The prime rib was cooked to order...4 of us ordered medium rare, 1 rare. 2 of the G-kids actually finished their meals & were asked if they'd like another prime rib (no charge)...they declined. Seeing the meat in the lighted cart is impressive & the flavor was very good. It appeared that the knife used to cut it was not very sharp though...not a clean cut...my husband said it looked like it had been cut with a chainsaw!! We brought our own wine & the $25 corkage fee seems to be the norm. Unfortunately, after the first bottle was opened & finished it seemed to take quite awhile to get the 2nd bottled opened. We poured it ourselves because the server was busy?? We were there on a Sunday at 4PM. It was busy, the noise level elevated, but OK. I doubt we will go back again anytime soon.

We made reservations 2 months ahead for a table. We didn't need to wait long to be seated on a busy night. Our waiter was excellent, didn't need to wait long for your drinks and bread. Prepared our salad at table side....delicious. The grand finale was our prime rib, you pick your cut, and they cut it right in front of you. It's cooked perfectly....tender, melts in your mouth 

Fantastic prime rob cooked to perfection!

No personalized service. Ate at the bar as a single person. The bartender asked me what I wanted to eat prior to me ordering a drink. I had to tell him I would like a drink first. Ordered prime rib (only thing on the menu) but I asked for no creamed spinach, and instead wanted an extra yorkshire pudding. Neither of my requests was made. The prime rib was good, but I was just a customer to them, really poor service and poor fulfillment of my requests. Wont be back.

Had heard about the restaurant for years, and finally got to enjoy it first hand. The Prime Rib selection is excellent and does not disappoint. Tender, juicy and cooked to perfection. I was pleased to see there was NO well done as a choice.Apart from the food, the table service was excellent, as was the wine list. The restaurant was very crowded, which is to be expected, and made the entire evening even buzzier and enjoyable.Will definitely make a return visit.

They serve Prime Rib. There is also fresh fish for non-meat eaters, but why go to an iconic meat place if you don't like meat?I asked for mine to be seared because I'm not a huge prime rib fan. If you request it at the time you order, they will do it. It was great. Their meat is way above average!The salad is tossed and served tables due with their own dressing. Everyone agreed it was excellent. It is hard to get reservations, so plan ahead. Prime rib doesn't get any better than this. It is all they specialize in. The meat is carved at your table from large carts. Portions are huge, so bring your appetite.

It's easy to see why the House of Prime Rib is so successful. It offers a single product, roast beef, and matches it with a giant loaf of excellent sourdough, a huge baked potato, a giant salad prepared at the table, and even corn or spinach. All of this for only about $70, drinks and tip included.This isn't the best roast beef I've ever had, but it is pretty good, and the overall package is unbeatable The atmosphere is crowded and noisy.

The food was amazing and generous proportions. I ordered the House of Prime Rib cut and it was way too much for me with everything else they served. Also I would not recommend sitting in a booth, ( we were in a corner back by the restrooms ) our group felt that the table was way too close to our bodies and there just wasn't enough room to get comfortable with our plates right under our chins. Everyone in our group commented after the plates were cleared away that we had felt rushed and didn't really get to enjoy our meal. One family nember was still eating when the server asked if she could box up her dinner for her. Once again, the food was delicious but after driving 2 hours to get to the restaurant and having a huge bill I felt that we should have been able to enjoy ourselves a bit longer.

Our meal at the House of Prime Rib was the last meal of our stay in San Francisco. I was extremely choosy which of the many fine restaurants in San Francisco would get this distinction. I ultimately chose House of Prime Rib for its excellent reviews, menu, and historic standing in the city. The Mr. and I arrived to a bustling restaurant with standing room only. Luckily, I'd made a reservation, but even then we weren't seated immediately. We were starving, since we hadn't eaten since brunch, but the wait was well worth it. We both ordered the House of Prime Rib Cut which came with our choice of potato (mashed), creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, delicious bread, and what might be the best green salad I've ever had. We adore prime rib and this was cooked (medium rare) perfectly. We enjoyed the selection of fresh horseradish sauces too. Our intention when we arrived was to save room for dessert, but our meal was so good, we couldn't stop eating! We left full and extremely happy that I had chosen The House of Prime Rib!

The decor of this place looks like its straight from the steakhouses of the 1970's. That aside, this has to be one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.The waitress was very friendly and prepared our salad table-side - Doing the salad dressing in a spinning bowl floating in ice water. We were then introduced to our chef for the evening, who carved our meat from one of the big silver units that were pushed around the restaurant.The food was amazing - The steak was tender, the gravy was rich and the mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth.

We arrived at 5:45 pm and we're referred to the bar for a table. However the bartenders and the whole area was so busy they did not acknowledge our presences. We tried twice to ask but they were busy shaking cocktails.Even if you are a popular restaurant there are ways to treat customers to at least show you care about their patronage. This review is a two star as it seemed they employed two few staff. And stressing out the one s they had. We left because we did not feel welcome.

The last time I ate at House of Prime Rib was 40 years ago. It's amazing for any restaurant to remain that long and even more amazing that the quality is still there. If you love prime rib, this is the place for you. High quality, best tasting beef. Classic sides. And the service is first rate. Just attentive enough without being overly so. Try to get reservations but the restaurant also gave us this tip - come at 4:30 and put your name in for some of the tables they hold for those without reservations. Very well worth it.

The place was historic and cozy, you can see the tradition in the place. The prices aren't cheat at 40+ dollars, but the experience, the beef alone was enough to say it was more than worth it. The wait staff is attentive, funny at times, and really want you to have a great time. The beef was amazing, the fixings were a meal on to itself, and the dessert was....ok. Not bad, but not too amazing. If you can splurge in one meal in San Francisco, this is the place. Again, this is not cheap, but it is worth it.

As always, excellent service, amazing food, and priced well. There were three of us. We all had a cocktail, and two of us had the largest cut. With tip, $220. You can't beat that in SF.

Restaurant assigned this waiter who was so miserable: he complaint to us that he did not like to serve our section because there were too many small table! Really!?!? As a result, he gave us the worst service by not brining us our drinks until 15 minutes after placed the drinks, not check-back on food and not offering us seconds. We even had to track him down for the bill. Worst service ever for a supposedly decent restaurant in the City! Very disappointed.As for the food, it was okay, we all had prime ribs but were never offered seconds because our server did not like to serve the section we sat at. I do not recommend and I would not go back!!!

Very large restaurant with several dining areas. Was lucky enough to snag a table for 2 on OpenTable the night before, but definitely make a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance. The menu is basically three different size cuts of prime rib and sides. Very affordable, had 2 cuts of prime rib and a bottle of wine for $150. Definitely recommend over some of the higher priced steakhouses, you'll get a much better experience and bang for buck here.

The House of Prime Rib was a dream come true. I grew up loving Prime Rib and mashed potatoes and this was probably one of the best prime ribs I've eaten in recent memory. I was lucky my friend made reservations here a month in advance when she found out I was visiting SF. She knows me well and knew what I liked! The prime rib was deliciously mouthwatering - so flavorful and tender. The sides (creamed spinach, your choice or potatoes (mash or baked), creamed corn and Yorkshire pudding) were all very yummy and a great accompaniment. Large portions, which also included Boudin bread and salad to start before the large, juicy cut of Prime rib is carved right at your table. Seconds were available if requested - I wanted to cry of happiness. An amazing meal with friends! Every bite melted in my mouth! I'm dying to go back.

The House of Prime Rib is a very popular steakhouse in San Francisco's Nob Hill. We could not get a reservation there and we were told to take our chances walking in. The night we were due to go, my brother in law got a reservation through his "open table" phone app. We arrived a few minutes early with a special bottle of wine from Napa. The English style decor is charming in this deceivingly large restaurant with many rooms. Parking is virtually non-existent so take a cab. The menu is to the point. We had a choice on the size and wellness of our prime rib, baked or mashed potatoes, creamed spinach or corn. Everyone got a salad which featured hardboiled egg and beets and is made at your table. The salad was so good that I wanted to forget the rest. Then the chef arrived with a cart full of aged, slow cooked rib roasts and sliced a piece and fixed our plates to match our orders. Each of us received a pan cooked Yorkshire pudding.I thought the steaks were some of the most tender I've encountered. They were however lacking the flavor achieved by cooking it faster and rendering more of the fat. The vegetables and Yorkshire pudding were also lacking flavor. The service was okay. They rushed around the place and had us out of there in 1 1/2 hours. They charged us 2 corkage fees to open our 1 1/2 liter bottle even though we paid for 4 glasses of their wine while waiting for our table. The wine steward did a good job opening the bottle although he did not have the proper corkscrew for a 10 year old cork.Overall, I was not as impressed with The House of Prime Rib as I hoped to be. I think they are pricey and terribly over rated. I will not be rushing back any time soon.

So first, its an old school steak house....when I say "old school" get a tux on and have a 4 o'clock martini before dinner! The place isn't decorated and super fancy, but it has the kind of vibe that makes you want to eat and drink. The restaurant is organized into several rooms, and can get quite noisy at times. If you want a quieter experience ask for one of the plush large booths along the wall of the main room when you walk in.Our server was extremely nice, attentive and friendly. I'm from New Orleans, so I'm used to excellent service, that sadly, many other cities' wait staff haven't learned. Not here. Our server was perfect with checking in, but not being overly intrusive. And she was moving like a hummingbird - darting from table to table and guest to guest with a wonderful smile. The menu is quite large with several cuts of meat and options. I decided to get the option with the smaller cut and no salad. My friends got the whole enchilada and were overwhelmed by the amount of food. Leave your Lipitor at the door! There is butter, fat and overall deliciousness abound. The salads looked great that came with the entree and it was a nice touch that they were made table side. The entrees had huge cuts of meat with lots of nice marbling...just like prime rib should. The baked potatoes were heaped with bacon, sour cream, cheese and chives. Overall it was a great meal, not overly pricey but not cheap. That being said, you will leave full, stuffed and generally in a food coma, so don't eat too much before and come hungry!

Living in SF, this is the place to bring any out of town visitors or for special occasions. Food quality and service has remained consistently good. My only complaint is the front staff whom you check in with for reservations and the people who seat you. They always seem u happy and aloof. However, the wait staff has always been excellent, quick, and have a great sense of humor.

My wife and I visited the restaurant after reading so much about the restaurant. The menu was very simple and you can select your preferred cut Prime Rib which was prepared for us by the table side. The service was attentive but the wait at the bar was not an pleasant experience. However I was very pleased with the quality of Prime Rib steak and its special gravy.We were lucky to secure the last minute booking at 9:00pm from some last minute cancellation. There was a long wait of crowd at the entrance corridor but it created the right busy atmosphere.We drank two bottles of nice Napa Cabernet Sauvignon and the wine list were pricey but offered large selection of locally made wine.

Visiting SF on a business trip, we got some recommendations for steak in the city. There were a few names, and amongst them, House of Prime Rib. Everyone agreed that while food is not the absolute best, we should give it a try as it is an 'iconic landmark'. Our business partner phoned them up and by chance we could get a reservation (as someone just had canceled theirs).We went there and it was quite disappointing. Loud, crowded - okay, that happens in many restaurants in the US. But the waiter was lousy, lame and forgot to bring even the drinks. Speaking off, the Gin Tonic and the Wodka Orange were undrinkable so we had to return them. The bread served first was okay-ish at best. The salad which comes mandatory was not fresh, was covered in 'house salt' and way too much dressing. It was more for the show than any taste. The main course was only slightly better - the meat was good, the creamed spinach average at best. All in all very disappointing and far from anything I would expect from 'one of the best steak houses in San Fran'

Being a die hard fan of Lawry's for years, I finally found a much better prime rib, actually I was told it should be called roasted beef, in the world. The atmosphere is totally different. It is crowded and noisy. The staff is too proud of themselves and their restaurant that you can say they are arrogant, delivering quality service with pride. Their beef is amazingly juicy and delicious. I would highly recommend medium rare. It is perfect. If I can defend for Lawry's, their Yorkshire Pudding is not as good as Lawry's. Will certainly go again when I visit San Francisco next time. Need to book well in advance.
