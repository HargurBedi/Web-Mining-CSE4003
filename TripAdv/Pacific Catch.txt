We googled good seafood in our area and this gem came up. We had a fabulous meal and went back again a couple of days later. We had the Salmon and we've never eaten Salmon that tasted like that, it was out of this world compared to the stuff you get in the UK. Good service, amazing food. The sweet potato's are to die for. The food came really quickly for us also so we weren't waiting for long at all. There is also seating outside and at a bar which is great. Great little place.

We read all the reviews on tripadvisor having spotted this restaurant near to our hotel. I had the Hawaiian Teriyaki with grilled salmon and I have to say it was to die for. My partner opted for a daily special with prawns and Utan noodles, again rating the meal as lovely, full of fresh ingredients. This is a very busy, small restaurant and we were nearly put off by the interior size but decided to persevere and we were really glad we did. Our main waitress was Aimee, according to the bill, and we thought she was efficient, friendly and welcoming. If you don't fancy the restaurant because of its size you can get food to go and this was extremely busy throughout all the time we were there. If we weren't so busy on this holiday we would definitely go back. Just an all round fantastic restaurant, would 100% recommend.

We visited Pacific Catch while staying in the Marina are, based on the Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is small, but the service was quick and friendly. The menu is original -- offering many alternative preparations for fish and sea food. The tuna sandwich, poke and salmon where outstanding. We where so pleased that the 2nd night in San Francisco we ordered take out from Pacific Catch too.

The place is very big, and I think they have a lot of restaurants, the waiters are very nice, but you went there to eat and the food was not good. They serve fish, also raw, but the quality of the fish is not enough. My boyfriend got fish, and he had stomach ache during the night. I had a rice bowl with a lot of stuff but everything was without taste.

All of it was delicious and fresh tasting. Quite possibly the healthiest and most delicious meal I have eaten while on vacation.

The staff is on top of it. Food was outstanding. Both fresh and a lot of taste and flavor combinations. I had the tacos with avocado, fish, and a tomatillo sauce that completed the flavor profile. Service was very good. This place is in the city and it is literally 15 feet wide and had only a couple of tables and a bar to eat at however the food made it worth the trip to go there for lunch. Close to Fishermans Warf.

My husband and daughter wanted to eat seafood while we were in San Francisco, but I can't eat it. Pacific Catch was a great choice for us because there was something on the menu for all of us. My daughter was hoping for sushi, but the Chestnut Street location does not have that option on their menu. She ordered the Fish and Chips instead and was very pleased. I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Salad and was more than satisfied. The rice bowls also looked amazing.The Chestnut Street location is very small, but we arrived early enough in the evening that we were able to walk in. The staff was helpful and attentive. Given the opportunity, this is a place that we would return to.

In the word of my G/F "This is the best guacamole, ever". The food was a real delight with the mixture of flavours coming through with each bite.

My G/F also went tacos with a nacho side and wouldn't stop saying how awesome the guacamole was. Defiantly worth visiting if in the area. They also sent out about 75 deliveries while we were there.

While on one of our walking treks on this visit to San Francisco, I checked my usual source TA for a new spot to try. Pacific Catch was highly rated and the food pics were gorgeous! We were a couple of miles away, but since walking is a great replacement for the gym - why not! Lol. Boy was it worth the walk. The food is incredibly fresh, inventive, gorgeous to the eye and yummy to the tummy. Don't get me wrong, this is a tiny place. If you are fortunate enough to score a table, you will be able to easily view your neighbors food and will probably end up in a conversation with them just because you are so close you feel like you are eating family style. We tried the Ahi Tuna salad and the Hawaiian Poke salad. Both were awesome. If you love fresh, healthy and tasty ingredients, give them a try. By the way, the service here is friendly, helpful and efficient. What more can you ask for.

We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (the place is only a few tables and bar) at 6pm on a Monday night. Regardless, the service was friendly and on point. I had the Japanese Wasabi rice bowl with Hawaiian poke and it was excellent! So many wonderful flavors and a huge serving. I also had a few sweet potato fries which were perfectly crispy and salty.Love this place - makes me wish there was a LA location.

I ordered a tuna salad.The tuna was perfectly grilled on the outside and pink on the inside. Just how ist got to be. The best Thing about the salad was the Dressing. It had a light spicy, salty tase. I dont know what it was, but it was the best Dressing I ever had

We went at 1130 on a monday and got right in but this place is super small so wait times are long. There are other locations but the one in the marina is the best. I do not think you can order wrong here with the assortment of seafood.

We had to wait for about 1 hour for a small table inside, however the food was delicious. I had the taco sampler, it was delicious. I had mahi-mahi, shrimp and skirt steak tacos. The sauces were great, delicious sweet potato fries and the tacos were amazing. Highly recommended.

Well worth the wait

You cannot make reservations at this restaurant but it was well worth the wait of 30 minutes on a Saturday night. Jeffrey, our server, was most attentive and suggested some great dishes. All the food was great. The fish and chips were nicely cooked with a light batter and the rice bowl (suggest half salad, half rice) was very filling and tasty. For those with a sweet tooth the desserts were great as well. A great find an worth its spot as one of the top places to eat on trip advisor.

We came at lunch time without a reservation and we had a place although it was crowded We took a beer, 3 kinds of tacos (beef, fish and chicken) the beef was our favorite. And the appetizer ceviche (3 kinds of fish) that came with nachos , seaweed and another salad. this dish was absolutely delicious Good service(The place is a little bit small so maybe better to reserve a place)

Simple with excellent flavors

This place is all about flavors. We went there with friends for casual lunch and we tried a few of their dishes. The Tuna salad, the Salmon salad and the fish tacos were all fresh, good size and excellent. The appetizer we share which include 3 different tuna serving in what looks like ceviche, was absolutely spot-on! This place is great for casual or low-profile business lunches or no-special occasion family out.

Inauthentic

We visited this restaurant with a friend who said the cocktails were good. Unfortunately we ate!We saw a Japanese restaurant right next door, wanted sushi, but she took us here.We ordered thai soups which were good, and sushi which was absolutely not to our taste. I suppose generously you could call it fusion, but sushi filled with mayo and cheese are absolutely not my thing. So called firecracker sushi with srirachi sauce had no heat and all mayo. I found them tasteless and gloopy.

Love it!

Last night in San Francisco and we decided to try this restaurant and we are so glad we did. It is very small with very few tables, we were very lucky that it wasn't very busy.The waiters are so nice, the ambience is great, service is quick and food is lovely.We tried the soup of the day, tacos, bowl of rice, steak was so soft, shrimp was juicy and full of taste, everything was well clocked and well presented.Cheese cake with vanilla ice cream was heavenly.Prices very reasonable, recommended!!

Everyone should try this place at least once

On the trip advisor listings as of October 2016, Pacific Catch is ranked 14, out of 4260. Now that is impressive. Maybe there are some places with better food , or some with better service, or some with a better location or better staff. Well yes, maybe. But this restaurant (it really is a busy cafe), has got the total package, and after dining here, it is understandably as to why it is rated #14, and why customers are happy to queue up to wait for a vacancy. The food is representative of what is available from some countries on the Pacific rim. For example where else can you get a Vietnamese Tortilla. Food styles are from Hawaii,Mexico, Asia, Japan and obviously...U.S.A. One thing that is a constant in all great restaurants is their ability to attract and retain good staff. I thinkour waitress was called "Joy". One of the best. I can not recommend this restaurant high enough. I give it a 14 out of 10!

Happy Hour Stop

My husband and I went for happy hour one evening and sat outside. Service was not very good. Server took very long time coming back for drink refills, bill and finally for us to pay and leave. The food was good but not great. We had the Shrimp Ceviche, Calamari and then several taco's. I had chicken and it was good. Husband had Mahi Mahi and another one. It was supposed to be shrimp but was not.. and he just decided to eat vs wait for another because of service issues. I think it was a different fish one. I wouldn't return given there are so many other restaurants in San Francisco.

Great food...why we keep coming back!

We ate here a bunch of times on our last stay in the Marina area so when visiting again recently we ate here twice again. Consistently great tasty food. Its a small restaurant so there'll probably be a wait but its worth it! Nice staff too. When locals use it & for takeout you know its good!!

Best meal in SF

Really, really excellent. Went here on our last night in San Francisco following 3 weeks in Northern California. Hands down best food we had all the time and best fish I've eaten anywhere. Menu is a mix of East Asian style grilled fish (pokes, rice bowls etc) and Mexican style fish (tacos etc). Everything we had was delicious. Quite pricey but definitely worth it.This is a small venue, we sat at bar style seating but really enjoyed watching the chefs cook just a few feet away.

Fantastic staff, excellent food for affordable prices

The place is very cozy and quite small, however, the service staff is so fast and good, that we didn't have to wait long to sit, order and eat. The food is great - especially the seafood tastes amazing and local: the fried calamari I can recommend to anyone! The portions are quite large, so if you take a starter and an entree you will be quite full - happy and content, but very full! :)It is worth visiting this place for sure, something unique!

Amazing Tacos and service !!

This place was on my list of places to eat at and I was not disappointed. Great service, friendly staff, and clean establishment. The kitchen especially was very clean! I ordered the three plate tacos and order one of each a steak, shrimp, and Mahi Mahi. Although I wasn't a big fan of the mahi mahi all the other tacos were amazing. Great dipping sauces as well and the sweet potato fries were scrumptious. Prices reasonable for the quality and quantity of food not to mention a relaxed laid back atmosphere. Must try if you are in the area

Possibly my favorite meal in San Francisco

I think this is classified as Pan-Asian fare, with poke bowls, rice bowls, tacos and more. I had a two taco platter, one mahi mahi and one steak. Loved them both. The restaurant is TINY though-not much seating available, but the food was excellent! We stopped here as part of our Urban Trek tour, and I was so thankful our tour guide recommended this place!
