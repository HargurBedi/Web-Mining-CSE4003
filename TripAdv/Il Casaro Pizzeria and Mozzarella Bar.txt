Our concierge recommended this place and we were grateful.It is a considerable walk from Fishermans Wharf but more than worthwhile.The modern noisy restaurant seems to be constantly busy - easy to see why! But we were seated quickly and the food and beers arrived quickly and frequently.My wife is the pizza expert and rated the Quattro Formaggi one of the best (including those from Naples and Rome).This is a buzzy pizzeria with a young vibrant clientele and we thouroughly enjoyed ourselves.

If you are in love with the good italian pizza, you must come to Casaro.Small local in little Italy, they do not accept bookings, so book it at the entrance and wait your turn.The pizza is really good as in Italy, the type of pizza is Neapolitan with the tall and soft crustsThe waiters are friendly and professional.Stop to do absolutely in SFAlessandro

The pizza is authentic and really tasty. We stumbled upon this little gem walking through the north beach area and had to try it, and we would definitely recommend. Quick warning, the olive oil on the tables is infused with spicy peppers and has quite a kick to it. 

Nice place great antipasto

Nice place with friendly, albeit very busy staff. The antipasti were very good (real buffola) and the pizza's are prepared in a woodburning oven. During our visit, sunday evening, it was very busy, with a lot of people waiting for a table, which may have been the reason that the pizza's could have spend a little more time in the oven. Nevertheless, I would definately recommend this place during a stay in SF>

Did a little research and discovered there is a little italy area in San Francisco. After burning off calories exploring the area we decided to look for an Italian place to eat. We turned to trusty Yelp. We got here about 6:15pm on a Friday. As with most places in the city that we have seen it is not very large in size but they use the space well. There are probably seats for 40 to 50 people including the counter area around where they prepare the food.We reviewed the menu and placed our orders. We ordered the Polpette Al Sugo (ground beef meatballs with napoletan tomato sauce) appetizer, a Diavola pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, Italian salami and calabrian peppers on the side) and a calzone (tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham, mushroom, arugula, raspa dura cheese). The Polpette Al Sugo was an amazing start, very tasty. The main courses were also fabulous. The pizza had just a little bite.Within 45 minutes of our arrival, there was a line outside.Overall a great experience. The only negative I can think of is that it was a little noisy inside.

We went to the Casaro after reading TripAdvisor reviews, but after trying in another pizzeria close by. We were very positively surprised. The pizza was very good and really done on the "neapolitan" style, since we are from Naples. Services was not sophisticated but good enough. Price adequate considering we are in SF.

We had pizzas for dinner and the cauliflower appetizer, as well as the burrata cheese one, with olives, and a bottle of wine, with tiramisu for dessert. This is a popular local place that I would definitely return to!

We were so pleased we stumbled upon (literally, we had been in the funky little Bar 1232 around the corner) this quality Italian.There was a 15 minute wait at the door before seating became available but this just got us in the mood for what was to come - delicious meatballs and mussels for entree, both served in a tasty tomato sauce with bread on the side and a prosciutto pizza for main course which was excellent too. We sat up at the bar overlooking the busy woodfired oven and chatted to our neighbouring diners over a good quality valpolicella.A very convivial evening. It is worth seeking this place out.

Been meaning to try this place out the last few times I've been in San Francisco and finally made it. Showed up shortly after opening and got seated right away. It was relatively empty when we arrived but filled up fast! We had the Margherita and loved it, simple and delicious. Service was efficient and professional. I wish I had one of their Margherita's right now! Will definitely return to try other things on the menu.

We were cold, wet and hungry on this late summer afternoon. Our morning Segway tour took all over some of the best neighborhoods in San Francisco, including North Beach and the tour guide kept pointing out all his favorite restaurants. Right after the tour we walked the familiar streets we remembered and followed our nose. It lead us to Il Casaro!! And, it did not disappoint. The pizza was perfectly topped with the right balance of sauce and cheese on a thin crust that jus melted inside your mouth. I had the lasagna and though, it was not the best I've ever had, all my taste buds were satisfied. "When I was in Florence last summer, my pasta and sauce was very similar," said my friend who couldn't keep her fork away from my plate as she crunched bite per bite on her delicious pizza.

I stopped at this restraunt on a family trip to San Francisco. 7 adults, the youngest in his late teens so no small children. The pizza was very good but the service was terrible. We saw our waiter twice in the hour we were there and he was gone too quickly for us to ask for anything. When we asked for more water, we waited 30 minutes before someone else brought us any. They included a 20% gratuity on the check, a bit generous given the service. The pizza was good, but not good enough to make it worth returning.

It's a ok food and you have to be patient. My food took over 39 minutes and I ask about it the owner said if I didn't want to wait I could just get out his place. So I wait for another 10 minutes and I asked again, he said to f@&$ off (bad word that I can't even write) and leave. I left but I payed my drinks and the pizza come on the check. I didn't want to ask to return I just wanted to leave. The burrada tasted like a frozen mozarela. In the end? Don't go!

Such an unpretentious spot - first discovered it a few years ago and I return to this North Beach affordable pizza place whenever I'm in SF. Looks like a little hole-in-the-wall place but don't be deceived - it's one of those SF treasures you need to be "in the know" about.Francesco, the owner, ensures continuity - the pizza tastes like it's from Old Napoli because he is actually from Calabria, near Napoli.Margherita pizza and Chianti from Italy never misses.Highly recommended. A true fav of mine personally.

It's never easy to find good Neapolitan style pizza outside Italy. Il Casaro Pizzeria prepares excellent pizzas which will remind of the the pizzas you will get in Napoli.

We were a party of six for lunch. It was picked kind of at random on web. This is a typical smallish, basic Italian joint with a small menu and a pizza oven. "Mozzarella bar" is pretty misleading as they had only three items that featured mozz cheese. Our party had pizzas, a salad and some apps. Everything tasted freshly prepared, scratch made and from good quality ingredients. The meatball app (3 pieces) was tasty. The stuffed fried risotto balls were not greasy and tasted good but they could have used a little more seasoning. The pizzas were good sized and had a great soft, tender crust that held up to the toppings. The salad was crisp and fresh. The roasted Brussels sprouts were also tasty, not scorched and bitter like at some other places. The service was friendly and attentive.

Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar, at 348 Columbus Ave. in San Francisco's storied North Beach, is a classic Neapolitan pizza eatery, not unlike what you might encounter on a side street in Milano.Having tried the pizza on several occasions, I'm down with the 4.5 star average reviews. You'll find a highly reliable, authentic, crispy-crusted, delicately yeasty pizza with just the right amount of "bite" to the crust.If you're not certain which pie to order, the waiter will readily point you to the burrata Margherita. Enjoy a glass or two of wine while you're there, and walk off your meal with a visit to the nearby Filbert steps, all 400 of them, all the way up to Coit Tower. Don't be a weenie, start at the bottom!!

If you are looking for a place serving the original, authentic pizza as made in naples, italy, then look no further. I tried the pizza margherita with the mozzarella di bufala. It was divine, down to the cornicione crust melting in your mouth and the somewhat watery mix of tomato sauce and mozzarella that forms in your plate at the end. I was not even hungry and ate a whole pizza in 5 minutes.

The pastas may number just three but the pizza is what makes this eatery thrive. Start with a antipasti like prosciutto la Daniele or burrata. Good start. Wines are available in even half bottle. Good selection of vino rosso. Pizza is a highlight. The prosciutto with arugula is the best. Some of the pizzas need more zest. The Panna Cotta should be ordered for those tempted. A spacious and light atmosphere makes for a casual setting. Good attentive service. Graciously welcomed. TV available for sports viewing. No valet parking.

We were torn between the pasta and a pizza here but be aware - there are only 3 pastas on the menu. The waitress guided us to the pizza as this was their specialty. We got the Il Casaro which was a mushroom/prosciutto delight with no red sauce. The crust was delicious and it wasn't at all soggy like some wood fired pizzas can be. That and a glass of vino and I was a happy camper! The seating could have been a little better - wood chairs and tables but not really sturdy. It's not a huge place either but on a cold and rainy night it was a little haven with good food and very friendly service. Another quick warning - there is NO parking anywhere on the weekend and no valet. We drove around forever and finally found a side street a couple of blocks up with an open spot. The good news is the meters are free after 6 pm but if someone in your party has trouble walking 2-3 blocks, you may need to drop them off.

Yesterday my husband and I had a dinner at Il Casaro. We've ordered fried mozzarella (it was recommended by other reviewer) - too oily coating for my liking. An arancini for my husband - he loved it. The pizzas were very good, thin Italian style. We ordered two, but I had enough with two slices (I usually do not it much and it was very feeling. My husband couldn't finish his pizza either). The staff was nice, but the music was too loud. I wouldn't come back at the evening, but will give it another try during day time.

Deeply Surprised

Its a pizza place with an excellent array of options. The service was very good, ambience was casual, we visited the place on a Tuesday with no hurry for reservation, on weekends the history might be different. Its located on a nice area with a lot of restaurants and night life. We ordere the traditional Margharita and one with Prosciutto, both were excellent, the staff was kindly enough to prepare a pasta not in the menu for our 2 year old daughter which was great. We got to order the Fried Mozzarella and the Rice-Balls which should be a must in your appetizer list. Wine very good...

Best pizza ever!

This place is the best! A great little modern pizza and pasta joint. The pizzas are wood fired, thin crusted (how I like them) with absolutely top notch toppings. We had the beet salad and the pepperoni and chilli pizza... both were worthy of top marks.The winelist is full of italian vino and the beer options are great!Not the cheapest place but not expensive either ($42+tip for pizza, beet salad, 1 wine, 1 beer and a large bottle of sparkling water)Overall a great dinner spot that I'll be going back to as often as I can find excuses to .Enjoy!

Not quite 5 stars; must try fried mozzarella

Really enjoyed this place but not in the camp of "just like in Italy". Fried mozzarella was excellent but perplexed at it being served with ice cold crushed tomatoes from a can as the dipping "sauce" -- no seasoning or oil whatsoever, literally tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes. Tasted like the same tomatoes were on the pizzas and while I can appreciate what appear to be San Marzano tomatoes, I do need something more than just crushed can tomatoes.My meatball appetizer was average; too many onions and too much gristle. Unremarkable.

Buon cibo!!

I was traveling through the area with friends and family, and we wanted pizza for lunch. Having traveled in Italy this pizza brought back memories. The mozzarella cheese is so good here! The pizza dough bread crust are all perfect. The variety is fine to select from. I liked the vibe inside and how the restaurant keeps windows open for a nice breeze and ventilation. It's fresh and not stuffy at all in there. Thank you to everyone who works here! 

Incredible pizza

This is a great place - wonderful food, a relaxed atmosphere and lovely staff. The only issue is it's first come, first served so the queue can be quite long. Try to get here early, but even if you have to queue, it's worth the wait!

Love it here

This place combines my two great loves and I wasn't let down. The pizza is fantastic (and tastes just as good too). It can get a little busy but there's a system to write your name on the door and check back and/or sit at the bar which is less popular than tables but in my opinion just as good and you get to watch the chefs at work. There's always a game (football, baseball etc) playing in here so if you really hate that type of thing then don't bother but it really didn't bother us and I can't even remember if there was sound as we were able to have a conversation very easily. The atmosphere is great and although it's always full it wasn't super noisy. Would definitely be a regular customer if I lived here.

Must stop for pizza

Great easy dining with awesome pizza. Try the burrata mozzarella as it's a must! The il casaro pizza was better than pizza in Italy

We visited this location. The service was incredible. Our server was funny and tied in some local facts from Toronto. The food was quick but absolutely delicious. Incredible portions sizes. We had pizza, risotto balls by most impressive by far was the calzone. It was HUGE. Would absolutely visit again. 

Best pizza in San Francisco

Walked past this place on our way back to the hotel and decided to go in for a pizza. Good choice, the pizzas were absolutely brilliant. One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Only negative thing was no free wifi.. Get free wifi so visitors and check in while eating there = free publicity.

Good Italian style!

Little Italy feast

Staying in the Financial District, you have quick access to Chinatown and Little Italy. After reading a review of a couple of places, I chose Il Casaro because it got great reviews and there looked like there were plenty of seats. We ordered, for an appetizer, the fresh buffalo mozzarella and asked them to combine it with prociuotto . We ordered a Fra Diavlo pizza making it slightly less spicy than they usually do. The mozzarella was sublime and the prociuotto was melt in your mouth delicious. The pizza was superior and not too spicy. I would order it again. We sat next to people who were being consulted snout opening more restaurants, so maybe they're expanding. That would be a good thing. This is a small, but high quality dining establishment. 

Don't walk past this gem!

Nice place, but very loud. Pizza is good, although our Diavolo was very greasy. Nice selection of draft beers, friendly staff.
