A friend and I were hosted by Don as part of an "EatWith" event, where 15-20 strangers have dinner together in a space leased by Don. In our case, the space was the beautiful dining room of a boutique San Francisco hotel, which only helped to enhance the great experience:First the food - We were served a 7-course seafood meal consisting of traceable and sustainable ingredients picked out by Don, everything from fresh oysters to lightly smoked trout and delicious dungeness crab. All 7 courses were delectable, with homemade sauces and super fresh ingredients.The concept - Breaking bread with 15 or so strangers both local and international turned out to be a really fun experience. Topics ranged from recommended activities in SF to international food and travel and even some politics. A great time was had by all, and I certainly enjoyed the interactions with our neighbors from Sweden and the Midwest.Finally, Don came out to join the conversation at the end of the meal, and answered many interesting questions pertaining to seafood sourcing and consumption.Highly recommended!

Great food and great company

Wonderful seafood dinner - amazing oysters (the freshest I've ever tasted), grilled squid, trout baked in the oven and Dungeness crab. Every dish was superb, as well the company. For sure an experience to repeat

From the pictures on TA and the address and information shown on the website we were led to believe that we would be eating with Don in a penthouse overlooking the ballpark on the bay. We weren't told that Don rents available venues around the city for the evening. We eventually arrived at a dowdy room in a small insignificant hotel, down town which had a kitchen and small bar attached. The table layout was not conducive to a chatty convivial atmosphere as it was a narrow long table seating 13 people so my husband was opposite an empty seat. The people next to and opposite me were very nice but Japanese and only one spoke any English. The food was nicely presented and tasty but certainly not of the standard we expected. We were so looking forward to this "special" dining experience as part of our trip and came away very disappointed!! The final insult was that the bar put a bottle of Whiskey onto our bill which we had not had and luckily my husband spotted the "mistake" before he paid the bar bill. I am afraid I would not recommend this dining experience. Although we will try "Eat With" again in a different city or Country. Maybe we were just unlucky on this occasion.

This was a wonderful experience - communal seating with about 15 guests at a long table in a lovely boutique hotel, an unknown menu (we just knew there was going to be fish and seafood), and an opportunity to chat with the chef. Our meal started with locally baked bread followed by fresh oysters... some people didn't like oysters so it all worked in my favour as they passed theirs down the communal table to me. That was followed but a wonderful salad with little gem lettuce and thinkly sliced vegetables with a wonderful dressing - it was actually one of the highlights of the meal for me. Next came the sablefish which was delicate and creamy and an equally creamy chocolate ganache-like tofu dessert. I usually skip dessert but this was so light a creamy and delicious I decided to indulge. There were only two areas I thought could be improved upon. First, when we arrived at the hotel they directed us toward a bar but no one was there to serve and we didn't knwo if the people there were also waiting for this dinner or were from the hotel...apparently they were all for the dinner but no one had told them what to do and two people were already seated. That could have been a little more welcoming and organized by the venue. I would have been happy to spend 10 minutes mingling with a drink if only we could have gotten service. Instead we stood about wondering if we should serve ourselves or be seated at the table. Once we did sit down, the bartender from the hotel took a while to serve the wine we had brought. In fact, we were already on the second course. It might be a good idea to have glasses and buckets with ice already set up in advance and offer a simple welcome drink of sparkling wine so those still waiting for their wine to be served have something to drink from the get go. Otherwise, it was a wonderful experience!

I booked a reservation for my boyfriend's surprise birthday dinner for him and I, and 13 of our friends! Everything from the planning and chatting with Don to the actual Dinner and afterwards- it was perfect. My boyfriend and his friends were so surprised and LOVED everything during the dinner. Each course was a hit. This is an experience I'd like to do again! You can tell that Don really enjoys what he does because he's so passionate and yet, so humble! It's nice to be able to take your mind off figuring out what to order and let Don just take over and feed you great dishes one after another. He takes his time after the dinner he's prepared to chat fish with you and check in to see if you have enjoyed everything. Overall, a wonderful experience and only wish the best for you on your journey, Don! Thanks for taking care of my large group. Will be back for more!

This is a really unique experience. It is part of the "EatWith" program which connects local chefs with patrons. This meal is seafood based and more than that, high quality and sustainable seafood based. Don is a "fishmonger" turned chef as his bio says, but also dedicated and invested in serving seafood in season. This is like a pop-up event so the actual location of the meal is not always the same. Ours was in one of the oldest hotels in SF, and we were with about 27 other people, and had wonderful conversations with our fellow diners.So onto the meal...fresh oysters, blackened squid, Dungeness crab, fresh corn and a sable fish. Dessert was strawberries. All were fresh and stated delicious. I tried food I had never had and it was wonderful, so incredibly fresh.Depending on the venue, if you bring your own wine, there may be a corkage fee, but that is advised. Some of our fellow diners shared their sake with us.All in all this is a memorable and delicious experience. Highly recommend it.

Our "Eat With" experience with Don was the highlight of our trip! He served us 6 courses of sustainable seafood. Each course was better than the next! The stars of the show included the squid appetizer and the dungenous crab entree. Don has a background as a fisherman-not a professionally trained chef-but he could give the best chef's in town a run for their money! This dining experience was a great value.

This was our third visit to San Francisco and our first ever experience booking with Eat With. WOW! Don was our chef for the evening cooking sustainable and the freshest seafood available. Don is obviously passionate about food and in particular - Seafood. He explained every dish very well, the food was cooked superbly with amazing flavours. We were all looking forward to this evening and we all thoroughly enjoyed our evening and we're not disappointed. Would definitely recommend Don as your chef for the evening during your visit to San Francisco

I want to be very fair and very open with my feedback since this is not overly negative and not overly positive - its really just about knowing what you will experience with Don and the event. If this is what you are after then it will be awesome for you. If it is not, then your expectations will not be met, so really I am just helping ensure others get the right idea and then decide for themselves.DON AND THE SEAFOOD - 4 stars:Don is a great guy and he is an absolutely pleasure as a host along with being a seafood guru. He will openly admit he is not a gourmet chef and if you are expecting a gourmet meal be warned, that is not what you are in for. You will get careful attention to the freshest seafood (for us almost all raw and simply prepared) that Don is thoughtful about sourcing and offering. This is really his thing and if you care about where and what the seafood you get is and like simple delicious seafood that is what you will get. If you expect a gourmet meal (yes I mean gourmet) then no, you will be disappointed.LOGISTICS & LOCATION - 2 stars:We had a bit larger group and at the Majestic Hotel location - that probably didn't help the event get to 5 stars. The location is totally mediocre, we walked into a small bar with the wait staff eating take out chinese and sitting openly at one of the only three small tables. The dining room is not bad but definitely not compelling and the staff was nowhere to be found or attentive to our arrival about 30min before the event started. The real negative was the cheap plastic chairs which were really not good and the staff being absolutely subpar. Not mean/rude or lazy just not up for serving 30+ people in this format with bottle service etc. My recommendation make sure you go to an event with a smaller group and at the well reviewed penthouse across from the ball park, since I can only assume that is a much better experience.OVERALL: 4 stars (because I really like what Don is doing and the seafood was first rate):I do care about seafood, and sourcing and freshest product so I am willing to look past the logistics and the mismatch of any preparation expectations. But let me be clear, the location and staff (other than Don) were not great, the meal was not gourmet and the four stars are for what Don is about and what he is trying to do in getting us to care about the food we eat. If you are into the same then I welcome you to enjoy Don's event (just not at this location with this many guests!

Without a doubt one of the best evenings ever.Don undoubtedly knows his fish and how to engage others.The series of commentary with each course really adds to the experience. Each course was beautifully presented and so full of flavour. I've never had such good oysters, the squid was so tender and the sauce with it amazing. Gorgeous crab and beautiful dessert. No one left any food.The setting makes it special too.Meeting such nice other guests , who also appreciate good food and service makes it a meal to remember.Thank you both Don for making Ian's special birthday so good. If we lived in San Francisco we would be regulars. All the best for your upcoming event .x

This was our fourth meal with Don, but this is only my second review. Don's food continues to be up there with the best restaurants in the City. They're not cheap, but they ARE a good value. Don himself is very personable and we enjoy seeing him each meal. Sometime we'd like to join him on the fishing expedition the morning of the meal (where he then serves what he catches that day). We'll definitely be back!

We loved hearing about how he sources and chooses his seafood and the best way to cook and treat everything. I would highly recommend a dinner with Don!

Great experience and incredible food. Made better because it was prepared by a chef that knows the source of every ingredient. The setting was great, too. We were afraid we would be trapped in someone's house (with no alcohol available); however instead we were in a nice hotel, with the dining room and full bar all to ourselves (us and five other couple who made for great conversation). Definitely would do this again.

We attended Don's event in Stockton CA. I was really looking forward to his oysters and he did not disappoint! Two varietals so fresh they must have been harvested that morning! Sweet and tasting of fresh ocean! He also served BBQ'ed oysters which I enjoyed very much; I am simply partial to raw and Dons were fantastic! Along with the oysters was fresh grilled Monterey Bay calamari! So sweet and delicious! And a Hamachi Poke that again was unbelievably so fresh it popped in your mouth! The poke was tangy and spicy - really hit the spot. Perhaps the best poke I have ever eaten! And for portions,they just kept feeding us! It never stopped!If you love seafood, a dinner with Don is a must! Now I understand why his events fill up so fast! Don't wait, hurry and dine with Don! You will be very happy that you did!

We joined Don for a delicious evening that included a balanced menu, relaxed conversation and beautiful views! We had tagged along that morning as he purchased for the evening and learned a lot about his passion for sustainable, traceable water-to-table seafood. It was a chance for us to ask questions that wouldn't have been possible at the dinner given the size of the group (about twenty-five) and the attention to detail he gave to plating each course meticulously. From beginning to end, it was a special evening and a great way to celebrate our thirtieth anniversary!

Attended with a wedding party at a lovely downtown hotel. $100 a head got us oysters, 2 cold fish sushi dishes, fried squid and bread. Where were the cooked fish or famous crab dishes? Don is a great host and cares deeply about sustainable fish, just a shame more of those sustainable fish weren't on the table given the price. And $10 charge per bottle of wine when you take your own, as you are encouraged to do, is excessive. Left disappointed and hungry.

Dinner was pricey at almost $200 USD total for the both of us, but the price was absolutely worth it. We had at least 6 seafood dishes prepared for us and they were all to die for. To add to the experience, the venue was a beautiful penthouse directly across from the Giants' stadium. If you have the money to spend and you're in the area, dinner with Don is a must!

This was not your typical dining experience. We booked this based on TripAdvisor reviews. It is community dining, in a downtown hotel which was boutique style. They reserve the restaurant space so the attendees are the only ones in the dining area which was pretty cool. You get to meet and dine folks from around the world. We ended up meeting some really cool people and actually headed out for after dinner drinks! Food was flavorful and tasty. We went outside of our box and were not disappointed. You can either bring your own alcohol or purchase at the bar. I give this a four star only because the description wasn't totally informative upon booking. I had a completely different idea of what it was going to be before we booked and then after, we received an email stating event details more in depth. Not sure if we would have done this had we known all of that before booking but glad that we did it because we met some really cool people and were able to try something different.

We spent a pleasant morning tasting three different oysters, shrimp and watching the activity around us. I would highly recommend this tour if you are interested in where your food comes from.

We truly enjoyed the evening. We were fortunate enough to be seated across from two people who we got along great with, and the food was excellent. The seafood all tasted extremely fresh and the sauces used in preparation were outstanding. It looked like about three fourths of the crowd assembled was truly enjoying themselves, although it appeared that about a quarter of the people weren't well situated socially, or they did not appear to be very social, themselves. Fortunately, we were not among those people. It is a different experience than a typical restaurant, so I do not recommend it unless you are prepared to "mingle" a little with others at the table.

This was the first time we've eaten at Bimini Twist which was held at a Penthouse apartment across the street from the AT&T stadium. The food was high quality and delicious. We love meat and we were concerned that seafood only throughout the several courses would be ho hum. NOT! First, we don't eat oysters very much so this was a treat. They were in abundance and huge. A couple of weeks later we shared oysters at another meal at a very high end, trendy restaurant. The oysters were shrunken in comparison to what we had this evening. The miso soup and salad were beautiful, followed by crab legs, fish and dessert. An excellent meal while meeting such friendly people from around the world. Don was so gracious and talked through his preparations at each course. A wonderful experience. It was a memorable evening.

If you like fresh seafood, prepared thoughtfully yet simply, and enjoy supporting a fishmonger-turned-private-chef who just wants to share his food, then you need to come have Don take care of you. We started with a couple dozen oysters, followed by a smoked trout salad, then on to a calamari ceviche (spice and citrus married so well!), and then a white fish poke-style preparation with coconut milk. The main event was a half Dungeness crab and a gorgeous Santa Barbara spot prawn. Follow it up with a local ice cream and chocolate cookie, and color me seven shades of happy. We brought our own wines to pair (Don provided a glass of sparkling with the oysters, which is a nice touch). Friendly people - you can meet others and mingle of you wish, or just catch up with friends if you came with a group. Bottom line - it's a great dinner at a great price, and Don makes good on his promise of providing the best possible food available to him. Fishmongers know best!

This is similar to what we call a 'private kitchen' in Asia. The 'restaurant' is actually held in a private apartment with a limited number of seats that have to be booked in advanced. The apartment overlooks the baseball grounds so good views (though you can't actually see the field). Managed to get a last minute reservation and was looking forward to it given the great reviews we had read online. Depending on where/what you read, only a small welcome drink is included in the price. So bring your own bottle if you want to drink- given the price, this was a slight disappointment. Decent wine isn't that expensive. Food: Nice but really nothing special. The food was good because of the freshness of it all ie: oysters, cod, crab all very fresh and tasted good being cooked as close to it's original form. Service: Don's helpers were friendly and made an extra effort (though we felt a bit lost on arrival). Don himself, maybe it was an off night but he just seemed to be ticking the boxes of describing the dishes. If you don't show enthusiasm for something you've cooked, as your diner, we're unlikely to either. At the end of service, he then made an effort to go round and find out a little something about everyone- but again, it was more like ticking the boxes. If he just wants to be a chef and left to his own devices, then be that and don't make the rounds. But if you do, please do it because you genuinely want to know/meet your diners. Value: Expensive for what you are getting.Was expecting to be paying for something special but you are essentially paying for is high quality seafood. Would I go again, no. Would I recommend it? For people who love meeting others and having a social conversation, yes. For those who live outside of Asia and have not been to a private kitchen, yes. But if you live in Asia and have access to decent Japanese food, you'll probably be disappointed, like us.

I took several business associates from Europe to their first communal dinner. They were really impressed. The food was first rate. Don and his crew deserve the creme de la creme ratings they consistently get for Bimini. Beyond the food was the company. We sat with other guests from Singapore and the MidWest. Most of the people there seemed to be from elsewhere than San Francisco. Those of us who live in the City should take more advantage of this setting instead of paying 2X and 3X more for dinner at fancy restaurants plus here you can bring your own good wines to enjoy without charge.

Fun and Delicious!

Not only were Don and his helpful crew more than competent, everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, was wonderful. All the courses we were served, from the assorted oysters on the half shell to the Miso soup and beyond, were superb. But the Butterfish was beyond superb. There really aren't enough superlatives to adequately praise it. The quality of the fish and its expert preparation were extraordinary. Thanks for a great social gathering and an incomparable meal.

I had such high expectations for the Bimini Twist based on all of the wonderful reviews I'd seen on trip advisor. Having never been to an 'eat with' dinner before (I'm sure many guests had not), I was surprised that when we arrived we were not greeted by anyone.We stood in the doorway not knowing what the etiquette was. Remember, this is someone's house, so one should not assume to just walk in! We thought, should we come in? Should we take a seat? What do we do with our cold white wine on such a warm evening? Nothing, nada! The staff knew we were there but didn't do or say anything to us. When you are paying such a high price for a meal at someone's place, you'd expect a warm welcome! So the night didn't get off to an overly comfortable start to say the least. Thankfully we met some great people and that certainly helped get the night back on track. I must say though, Dons new penthouse is extraordinarily noisy! In my opinion this was due to the high ceilings and wooden floors. Don had to talk at the top of his voice to explain the dishes and even then I could barely catch a word he was saying. What was particularly strange was the layout of the tables. There were 3 oversized rectangle tables with 8 chairs on each. They were set up in way that meant you could not easily meet anyone other than who was on ourtable. From reading other people's reviews, when Don was at his old place, it sounded like everyone got to meet each other. But in this new place, with the tables set up the way they were, instead of having dinner and meeting 22 other strangers it actually means having dinner and meeting just 6! On a positive note the food was exceptional. Had it not been, I would have rated the Bimini Twist a one star 'terrible' rating. Finally to top off a fairly 'meh' evening Don went and met some guests, but didn't make an effort to meet all. #disappointing Would I come back? For the food, yes, for everything else definitely not!

Such a fun way to dine!

I loved the social dinner. This was my 1st time in this kind of dining. I was a bit nervous in the journey before getting there. But the oysters, sparkling wine and kind atmosphere made it so great. Every dish was perfect for a seafood lover. Got new friends and sure gonna visit Don again.

This isn't just a meal, its a completely different dining experience. its like paying to attend a dinner party. it was so welcoming and the conversation with the other diners was so eye opening and interesting. Visiting the USA in election time, listening to different people's views is just something you can't buy.The food was amazing, so fresh, so much and literally couldn't walk afterwards!

I live in San Francisco and discovered this while looking up places to eat in the area. I loved how this was in a home setting and we got to sit at a dinner table with a such a genial group of people whom we had never met before. We had visitors from Australia, Germany, England and South Carolina in our group! Don the chef is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about all things fish and can answer any questions about the state of fishing on the California coast and the world- which made the dinner that much more interesting. But most incredible was the multi-course meal, starting off with 2 varieties of oysters, followed by other deliciousness such as a poke bowl, smoked trout, and our own hunk of Dungeness crab. I highly highly recommend- it was such a memorable meal and evening!

We were in town for business but it was my girlfriend birthday and I wanted to have a great dinner for us. Looked around and read the reviews for Bimini Twist. This turned out to be everything and more for a great evening for us. The food was outstanding. The atmosphere and new friends and fun was a great, memorable way for us to celebrate her day. Loved it. Had a great time and we definitely will be back.

I wanted to plan a fun evening out while visiting my son who goes to SFSU. I found out about Don and the Bimini Twist and reserved about 6 weeks ahead. Our experience was absolutely amazing. We were joined by the most wonderful group from Google, and two fun couples from Toronto and Chicago. Everyone was really friendly and we engaged in great conversations. The oyster / uni bar was a fun way to start the night and meet everyone there. Once we sat down the food courses started coming out and every bite was spectacular. We paired our dinner with sake and Japanese beer which we brought with us and Don kept chilled for us during the champagne appetizer round. Our hotel was located downtown by the Montgomery St metro stop. We took the K all the way to Ingleside and then walked a short 10 minutes to the house. On our way back we took the K again. Ticket cost is $2.25. This is a fun, fast and easy way to reach Don's house.Thanks again Don and your staff for an amazing night!

This was the best meal of our vacation! Do it! The food (Butterfish night), the other guests, Don, it was all fabulous. A really great concept. A bit of a drive outside of the downtown (wharf) area, but other than that...great!

My wife and I discovered Chef Don through EatWith, a site that enables people to find intimate dining experiences that combine the craftsmanship of a five star restaurant with the ambiance of a Sunday family dinner. In our case, we attended the Fishmonger's Black Cod event at the chef's home at a table filled with interesting people from around the world. It was not only one of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had, it was also an introduction to seafood at a level I've never had before. The dinner started with oysters & sparkling wine. I'm not an oyster guy, but my wife tells me they are the best she's ever had -- which is saying something she's had oysters at some of the best seafood restaurants in Boston. The meal progressed to a Miso Stew and Seaweed Salad, both of which had a freshness and subtlety that made them a perfect intro to the meal.Next we had a tuna sashimi which was my favorite dish of the night. The tuna was jewel-like in its color and translucency. I've never had tuna that tasted so clear. I rarely eat sushi and sashimi since it can be a bit like playing Russian roulette -- but I'd have this every day.Next up was a Poke dish which was perfectly spiced and served on expertly prepared rice. Chef Don followed that with a Salmon collar which was cooked exceptionally well -- the exact right level of doneness to bring out the true texture and flavor of the Salmon. The last dish before dessert was the main event -- a buttery, perfectly prepared piece of sablefish (black cod) that literally melted in the mouth. After dinner, Chef Don came out of the kitchen to sit with us. He seemed like an athlete after an event -- he clearly poured his heart into the meal. He shared some of his knowledge about the food that he learned during his days as a fish monger, and it was clear that we got to experience seafood at a level of freshness and craftsmanship that few people do.I'd highly recommend an evening with Don and his companion Allie. Allie was a fantastic host throughout the evening and she made sure that we all felt at home. A visit to The Bimini Twist feels like a family dinner -- if your family includes a five star chef!

Hands down, I must while in SF!

Unexpected Experience that Made the Trip.

Ok, to start with this is not a restaurant so we had a little trouble when our Uber driver dropped us off at a residence. We went to the door and knocked. Don answered and I had to ask if this was the Bimini Twist. At that point we were welcomed in like old friends, introduced around to the other guests and the fun began. This is not the thing to do if you don't like conversation with others, but if you like great food and engaging conversation this is the perfect concept. Don prepared a wonderful meal in his home that cannot be matched in any restaurant that I have been to, and the meal was not even the highlight of this experience. THIS IS A MUST DO.

Delicious, warm and welcoming!

I've dined at Don's twice now, and the first time was such a fun experience - the food was amazing and the people were very warm and welcoming. The second time sealed the deal. Don is a great host - it was great to spend time with him and to visit a neighborhood not in the tourist books. My belly was happy :) Definitely must try when visiting, or even if you live local!

The Bimini Twist is definitely a must try! The food was absolutely amazing. It starts with unlimited oysters with sparkling wine and then a wonderful sit down dinner with 10 other people. The seafood was all very fresh and delicious! My husband and I still talk about the black cod (or sable fish as we call it in Canada) and how tasty it was.Highly recommended for a wonderful night of great food and great conversations.

Read about this on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try. It was rated #1 in San Francisco and now I know why. First, the food was amazing...very fresh, highest quality, nicely presented, and excellent flavors. We went for lunch and the tuna was the best!If you are looking for a unique experience, this is it! A\Physical address is not given until you after you make a reservation and pay for the meal. The intrigue added to the fun. We sat at a long table (great view of the bay) with other guest from around the US and world (Korea, Japan, Chicago, Eugene, Stockton, etc). The staff was welcoming, friendly, and efficient. KUDOS to Chef Don, the Fishmonger! We will be back and are telling all of your friends. Thanks for your part in making our anniversary special!

Don is an amazing cook and a gracious host. This was our first time dining at an "Eat With" restaurant (which is actually in the chef's home). Our dinner included a group of friends from Sweden, a family from Puerto Rico, a young couple from China, and us (the only Americans at the table). The only thing better than the food was the lively multi-national conversation! We started our meal in Don's kitchen with the best oysters I've ever tried, and champagne. Dinner included miso soup, grilled yellow fin, and butterfish. Clearly, Don is an expert at sourcing and selecting the very finest and freshest ingredients and his cooking allows the ingredients to speak for themselves. He was even able to accommodate a gluten allergy for one guest, without too much modification needed to the recipes (main difference was to substitute GF tomari sauce for regular soy sauce). One of the best dining experiences we've ever had and we highly recommend this to others!

Warm, informative, incredibly delicious!

The food and the cook were incredible. (plus, his amazing assistants) Don was so welcoming and a perfect balance of warmth and information - I learned about sustainable local seafood as well as an inviting atmosphere to get to know the other people at the table, and the pacing of the dinner was perfect to savor the food, and company. And, last but not least- the food was DELICIOUS.

I recently organized a family/friends trip to San Francisco with family coming in from all over the country and was looking for a truly special and intimate dining experience. This was IT! Chef Don Mayfield is very down to earth and did everything possible to ensure we had a great time. The food was perfect- all locally sourced and exquisitely prepared - the meal included delicious oysters, some of the best tuna sashimi I have ever tasted, fabulous clam chowder, fresh salad and japanese style black cod so buttery tasting and melted in your mouth. The local bread and even the butter was just the best. Everyone in our group was blown away by how special and fabulous it was in every way. I cannot recommend Don's dining event highly enough!

My husband and I enjoyed dinner with 12 others from varied places such as London, Sydney, Cincinnati and Sweden. The concept of dining in a chef's home at a large table surrounded by strangers might seem unusual but it was an incredible experience! I hope to do it again either in another city or with a repeat visit to Don. Each menu selection was perfectly prepared to bring out the best flavors by keeping things simple....no over-abundance of ingredients used nor an overly-fancy presentation...the food stood on its own and was fresh and delicious. It was a remarkable evening filled with amazing food and easy conversation!

My best friend and I were visiting San Fran for 5 days and she came across Bimini Twist and wanted to book it for her birthday dinner. I had never been to an "EatWith" event before so I was unsure what to expect. Basically a chef opens his home to you and several others on a given night for a preset menu. Don made us a wonderful seafood meal with multiple courses. It was a night of many firsts for myself including oysters and sea urchin. I would very much recommend this to anyone but since it is so popular, book well in advance!!! Thanks again Don, we loved it!!

We had dinner at Don's and it was amazing. We fancy ourselves to be pretty good home chefs but Don's dinner was incomparable. Both the ambiance and friendliness of the night makes it one to remember. We are poke fans having visiting Hawaii many times but Don's was the best we ever had. And the Black Cod (aka, Butterfish) was the best and now I know they also call it Butterfish....the way Don cooked it, it melted in my mouth like butter! Really a terrific dinner and evening!
