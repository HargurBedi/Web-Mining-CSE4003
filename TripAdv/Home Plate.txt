The hotel we stayed at didn't have any breakfast service so we took the advice from others on TripAdvisor and walked a block down from the hotel. We were surpriced about the quality of the food. Everything was nice and fresh, the omelettes wonderful and soft, and the fruit perfect. Nothing to fatty or overly sweet!We arrived just after they opened and got a table right away. The place filled up quickly. Great service! We hope to go back to San Francisco one more time and then return to Home plate!

Very filling breakfast. Think twice about sitting at the counter.

After having seen the reviews, we decided to try a Sunday morning breakfast (10 am). Less than 10 minutes after putting our name on the list (look for it hanging by the door), we were called. We were offered seats at the counter and took that option. Less than 2 minutes later we realized our error. Unless you are seated at the end of the counter, you face a wall and have your back to the room. 1 seat at the end of the counter lets you sit facing the front door. Will remember that for our next visit (and there will be one on our next visit to the city).Now for the good stuff. Service...prompt and friendly. Food...tasty. Portions...filling.A small scone (complimentary) was given to each of us soon after we were seated. Great flavor and not too filling before our meal.We ordered a veggie omelette with the potato-carrot pancakes and the steak & eggs with a side of fruit instead of the potatoes. Both were excellent choices. The omelette was fluffy and stuffed with vegetables and cheese. It was big enough that only 1/2 of it was finished at the table (counter). Toast is served dry with butter on the side. No bread dripping in butter here. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare) and so well seasoned that nothing else was needed on it. Not the best cut of steak (definitely needed the steak knife) but very flavorful. The side of fruit was larger than expected and definitely fresh. Nothing canned or past it's prime.Although we only spoke with our server when he took our order and dropped our bill, all the servers worked together as a team. Our beverages were never empty and we had everything we could have wanted for our meal.Will definitely return (and wait for a table).

Hard not to love this place - staff is super attentive and you get a lot of complimentary stuff with your meal. Great choice and great taste - we went several times for breakfast and on every occasion chose something different. sometimes you have to queue but it's due to the popularity - no surprise here!

 Delishious, fine dining style comfort food in a cozy cafe. Fresh ingredients, generous portions, reasonable. Great staff! I rate a 5 out od 5! I had the corned beef hash and it was a big huge hunks of corned beef and green peppers onions and potatoes. Unusually delicious. I saw the omelets overflowing the plates and people were raving about them. The crab cakes Hollandaise Benedict looked delicious. You will not be disappointed.

Wonderful little breakfast/lunch place. The omelets that my husband and I ordered were beautifully prepared and presented as well as delicious. The ambiance is welcoming and warm. The staff is exceptional and the open kitchen was like watching a beautifully choreographed dance. But, the most amazing part of the decor is the wall of chalk board, with the entire menu drawn on it. Beautiful. If you are near the Cow Hollow district, don't miss it.

This cafe is about a block away so taking into account the early start we needed to get down to Fishermans Wharf early for a boat trip we thought we would drop everything and focus upon the inferior structure. We both had pancakes but at 10 dollars a pop we thought this was quite expense. Not sure if we will return

Went here for breakfast and had a wondeful meal. Really great and fresh food. Even normally-bland items like toast and hash browns were very delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive, and even the other patrons were nice. It's a good thing, because the dining room is the size of a postage stamp... this place can seat maybe 30 people. However that just adds to its charm. We definitely recommend Home Plate!

Can't say it's a hidden gem as it's so highly rated on TA but we tried it because of the ratings and as we are staying next door. To view it from outside you probably wouldn't bother, big mistake, it was excellent. Tiny inside, seating probably for only 30 it was very busy, which is always a great sign. Plenty of hard working team so we didn't wait long, food was fantastic, we were seated right next to the serving hatch and it was obvious the car that was taken with presentation of every meal that went out. 10/10 look it out you won't be disappointed

We just ate here and it was superb! This is my first review but after a delicious meal and wonderful service I had to leave a raving review for this hole in a wall type business. They couldn't have been more accomodating. My family and I are on a vacation from Hawaii and there is 13 of us. I called this place before we headed there and they said they don't take reservations but they will try to accomodate us. We got there and was able to be seated immediately. Breakfast came out quick and it was delicious. I had the Huevos Ranchos #22 I believe. It was so yummy, just as I imagined it to be with that mexican twist to my breakfast. Love the tomatillo sauce! Overall great service and good food. Recommend to stop here, if you're staying near Lombard and Scott... super convenient. We will be back for more!

We were lucky enough to be staying a few blocks away on our last San Fran trip. The food is fresh, excellent and just a touch unique.

I think this might be the best breakfast establishment I've ever been to anywhere.

I wanted an authentic seafood breakfast in San Francisco and having read the reviews of Home Plate we set off next morning try it out. We'd heard of queueing potentially being necessary, what we weren't prepared for was to queue outside in the misty cold SF morning. You arrive at the small premises and if full you put your name on a list on clipboard on the outside window ledge. When there is room, the next names on the list are called in and after a 40 minute wait we were seated. I had been looking forward to the crab cakes so ordered straight up only to be told the las had been sold and a new batch was being made. I was told they could be ready in 15 no guarantee. I was set on them so decided to wait. 15 minutes later and two beautifully fresh crab cakes arrived and boy were they worth waiting for ! With fresh orange juice and coffee,it was a breakfast in bustling authentic surroundings that was definitely more than worth the wait. Sure there are cheaper and quicker places to eat breakfast, but better places, in SF? No, I don't think so.....

The bacon here was so, so good. So good that I made my friend go back a second time so I could have it again. Thick cut applewood, smoked bacon with a touch of maple syrup and chili flakes. Yum, yum good!I also had the Chorizo and Eggs, so did my friend, and it was bland and not spicy. We both added hot sauce. But we found a lot of food on this trip that we thought would be spicy wasn't! Also, the fruit salad wasn't that great but the scrambled eggs were on point.

We stayed at the Cow Hollow and had breakfast at both Mel's Drive In (opposite) and Home Plate (100 yards down the road). Both were very good but Home Plate edged it because it was a more personal experience (being smaller) and the prices were more reasonable. We both had "The Home Run" which was superb especially the French toast. The service was fast and friendly, and this was probably our favourite eating experience in 4 days spent in SF.

This place is absolutely horrible. All the reviews we saw were good, but it was horrible....and they failed a recent health inspection. The homemade corned beef hash is just chunks of corned beef....no potatoes....and it is bad dry corned beef. The juice was good but way overpriced at $3.50,,,,service was poor. Hash Brown potatoes were cold....like refrigerated cold. Save your money........go around the block.

I was out for a morning stroll w some friends, looking for a local breakfast joiny and we picked this place based on various online reviews. It's small, with maybe 10 tables. The restaurant was packed but we were able to get seated quickly.Service was friendly and prompt. Prices were normal.The menu had many options. Apart from the standard breakfast fare, there were quite a few intriguing options. I chose the Bangkok frittata - served with shrimp, galanga, cilantro and peppers. Different, tasty. Although served fresh I felt that it would've tasted better if served warmerPrior to getting our dishes, we were each served a small scone w a couple jams. Nice touch. Each of our dishes came with two small potato-carrrot pancakes. Interesting flavor. But they were too thin.I'd go back.

So I have driven past this place hundreds of times, I have heard many positive things about it but never visited until now. I have to say I understand the buzz now.I went extra early on a weekend before the masses hit the place and was promptly and warmly greeted and seated. The service was sensational. Very warm, friendly and efficient. The atmosphere was incredibly clean, organized and comfortable. It was not exactly what I was expecting. It was spacious and modern very well thought out.The food was terrific it arrived fairly quickly to order and everything was very fresh tasting. I opted for a simple Cheese and Salsa Omelet with Hash browns and an English Muffin. I checked out a variety of other dishes as they passed and everything looked fantastic. I cannot wait to go back again.

We LOVED Home Plate!! We were visiting SF and stayed down the road at Coventry Motor Inn. We were seeking somewhere close by for breakfast and stumbled across Home Plate. The first morning we went we were literally the only two in the restaurant (I've read a few reviews talking about how crowded it is - I'm sure that depends on time/season). The second morning there were more people but we sat right down. Not only is the food wonderful, the service was exceptional. Our waiter was just the sweetest. They brought us two scones w/ jam both mornings at no charge. The food is a little expensive, but isn't all food expensive in SF? A few of the things we loved: French Toast, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, carrot pancakes (? they were like potato cakes). We highly recommend this place for breakfast and would love to go back one day!

Lombard is the ugly sister of Union and Chestnut Streets, the three parallel dining and shopping streets of San Francisco's Cow Hollow and Marina districts. While not as pretty as the others, good food is available. For breakfast, the Home Plate is the star. Not pretty, not fancy, just good food and a surprisingly large menu. If you can, go on a week day. The line to get in on the weekend can be daunting.

We walked past this restaurant a couple of times before we actually found it. Its in the Marina district, but not in teh trendy area, like on Chestnut. Its small - seats maybe 20 people. The service is really excellent - they are fast, friendly and responsive. We had eggs, and although they were tasty, they weren't really hot. Next time we would make a point of asking the wait staff to bring the eggs as soon as they are made, even if the other guests we are dining with have not been served. We also had the granola with greek yogurt. It states on the menu is comes with dried apricots, but they are kind of grated onto the food and they weren't that easy to taste. But overall, good tasting healthily made breakfast. One big turnoff - the staff preparing the food did not have hats or netting on their heads. We noticed this before we heard our fellow diners complain of a hair on their coffee cup. Its a small thing, but its a big thing.

We were visiting from Massachusetts and go out to breakfast all the time locally, so we were pleasantly surprised to find Home Plate. Walked in and the staff was very welcoming. We had two of us and were waiting for a third (which ended up taking 20 minutes), but the staff was very accommodating and let us place our orders and immediately waiting on friend when they arrived. The first thing we received complimentarily were mini homemade scones with their homemade jams, I've never seen that anywhere. Ordered omelets and they were cooked perfectly. Their menu board is amazing, beautifully written and artwork and loved the baseball pictures around! We were visiting my niece and told her how much we enjoyed Home Plate and she said she never went, because there was always a long line...so we were very lucky to get in and even save a seat for a friend, but that was because staff were so nice.

Went here with my hubby for breakfast and had the Special Scramble, which was one of the best breakfast dishes I have ever had! My husband had the hash benedict, which he said was amazing as well. I had a bit of an issue getting the right dish, and the waiter was obviously perturbed that he misunderstood me, because he didn't wait on us afterward, but a waitress noticed we were being ignored and took over the service, which was nice -- was going to go with a 4-star because of the service, but the waitress turned things around. The complimentary scones were a nice touch, but I think they might have had a bad batch, because ours were dense and tasteless, and didn't look anything like pictures other people posted on TA.

At 1 pm on a Wednesday, Home Plate looked closed from the outside (dark) but a smiling waiter gestured us inside and it was nice and bright in there as we sat by the large windows. Everything is superfresh here--from the OJ to the free scones and jam. I had a hankering for huevos rancheros and they were excellent, too, with homemade salsa, avocado and tasty black beans on a fresh corn tortilla. The little potato-carrot pancakes they come with are great too, with accompanying applesauce and sour cream. My husband enjoyed his chicken sausage patties and sourdough toast and jam that came with his eggs. Loved the restaurant's baseball theme (sorry about the 2016 Giants, S.F.) and the entertaining menu blackboard spanning the restaurant wall. A nice local, healthy alternative to the IHOP across the street.

We happened to be near this restaurant while staying in San Francisco for 2 days. When I looked at the menu I knew I wanted to try the dulce de leche pancakes, they were pretty good; they also served us their jams at the beginning with some biscuits, oh boy those were good! Their bacon is also cooked just crispy but not burnt. I left wondering about other menu items, so the next morning we came back. That second day I was set on trying the all star bacon, OH MY, this was tasty, if you like sweet and spicy give it a try! The best part about this place is that you get good food for a fair price. If we had stayed another day in San Francisco we would have probably had breakfast there again. 

Absolutely Fabulous

We lined up for breakfast 4 years ago when travelling with friends. We are now back in our honeymoon and went in for lunch- just as amazing as it was 4 years ago. We got the BLTA sandwich and the Hot pastrami sandwich. They were perfect! Service was great and the food was even better! Thank you.

Coming from Central Time our eyes opened up way to early! We found this gem just a 10 minute walk from the Travelodge. Great tasting bottomless coffee, and breakfast selection at affordable prices. Communal seating. Amazing and caring staff. 

Wonderful Breakfast &amp; great service

Ate here with a group of 6 & all were very pleased...Their breakfast menu is very diverse with many selections. Small place. Our server gave us biscautti with homemade jams to try for free...yummy. Reasonable prices for very good food. Service was fast & very attentive.

Super Breakfast... You can´t miss this place!

Visiting San Francisco we came across this small place which turned out to be better then we expected. When we arrived there was a 15 minute wait. After seated the waiter was attentive and we received our food within a short period of time. I had the Marco Polo and my boyfriend had the Meat Lovers omelette . We shared a short stack of pancakes with berries/bananas. Upon receiving our food the waiter asked if we would like a picture. Which was very nice of him. Over all we enjoyed our visit to Home Run and if we are ever in the San Francisco area again we will be sure to visit.
