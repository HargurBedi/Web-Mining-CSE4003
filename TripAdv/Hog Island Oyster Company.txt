Definitely a place for oyster lovers! My lunch buddies ordered the 24 assorted oysters and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the clam chowder which was really good. Not your standard chowder, on the runny side. The sourdough bread was great for dipping. Hog Island gets very busy. Service was sporadic. Friendly but a bit lacking. 

Everything delicious

Always start my San Francisco visit with trip to Ferry Building and a stop at Hog Island. arrived around 2:00 pm and able to be seated at oyster bar. Ordered the mix of the local oysters and it did not disappoint !My dining companion had the mussels and frites - the sauce was to die for and I want to duplicate at home. We shared the octopus salad - delicious ! Along with a couple of glasses of Chardonnay and draft local beer completed a perfect lunch and kick off to San Francisco visit !

Hog Island Oyster Company is a large restaurant in the Ferry building. It is very popular & busy - expect a wait. They have indoor & outdoor seating. It specializes in shellfish. For lunch we thought the seafood stew was very good. We also ordered an oyster po'boy sandwich but it was served cold - otherwise it tasted good. The service was efficient.

Very popular place as demonstrated by the length of the line for people waiting to get in. The restaurant was well organized and the wait wasn't long. The fresh oyster selection was quite good and prices reasonable for the location. Service was attentive and helpful. A very busy and noisy atmosphere on the back side of the Ferry Building.

Though I am not a seafood fan but I wouldn't hesitate recommending Hog Island for some fresh seafood delicacies, oysters and beautiful bay views..It was my first afternoon in San Francisco and we were exploring options with my team from Singapore for some authentic seafood. Hog Island is a perfect place, if you're looking for genuine Oysters with nice wine or beer options, sitting outdoor and enjoying the meals with views..We ordered Rustic seafood stew, Chowder, Mussels and Corn salad..with some in house wines...It's a great place, whether with friends or family..conveniently located at the Ferry building, must try if you love seafood...

I stop by at least twice, every time visit of San Francisco The place offers, fresh oysters, best clam chowder and atmosphere. No matter how long the line in front of the joint is you will be seated within 20 minutes. Sit at the table or enjoy the look into the "kitchen" at the bar. It does not matter if you are alone, couple or with friends - its always fun. The price is little higher, but attentive service, perfect food and fun environment will make you forget about few extra dollars spent.

The great reviews are warranted. Since we were not very experienced with oysters but curious to try, our waitress suggested a sampling based on diverse locations so we tried fresh oysters from New York, Maine and Washington and we enjoyed them and how they were prepared simply. It goes without saying that the manila clam chowder is worthy of the high praise from other reviewers. Didn't realize I liked clams this much! We sat outside and watched ferries coming in. Maybe not the most awesome view but anytime you can sit outside and enjoy a beautiful day, go for it. This was the best meal of the week hands down.

Best oysters ever, but expect to pay a hefty sum. Although pricey, this is a casual place; I ate at the bar. I had 2 different kinds of raw, on the half shell, but I couldn't name them. Since I'm from the east coast, I'm used to fresh, not farmed oysters. Hog Island oysters were as good!

Came for the oysters and were not disappointed, best mean in San Fran!The oysters were fresh (from own Oyster farm) as well as other varieties. Were able to pick three different oyster types and the staff did a great job at explaining what were the differences between different oysters. Chowder was fantastic!! We were allowed to split it into two smaller plates so that we both try it. Must have on the menu.Grilled squid salad was delicious.After dinner outside the restaurant there are great views onto Oakland Bay Bridge

We enjoyed a late afternoon lunch. Starting with capital oysters on the 1/2 shell. Fresh, icy cold and delicious. We had the best clam chowder we've ever had! Two of us split an order and still each of our servings was loaded with tons of Manila clams, bacon and carrots in a rich tasty cream base. Just amazing and flavorful. Cod sliders were also very good. The polenta with mushrooms was ok but probably would not order again. This was a comfortable, busy place in the ferry terminal. It was nice to sit back and take in the atmosphere. Great visit!

If you are in San Francisco, you must visit the Ferry Building, and if you are in the Ferry Building and you love seafood, then Hog Island Oyster Co. is a place for you!There is always a line during peak hour, but the line moves fast, especially if you are only a party of 2. The hostess (with curly hair) that manages the line is always very friendly and efficient. If you can, try to sit outside while enjoying the view to the Bay Bridge or inside at the oyster bar and observe how they shuck the oysters. All the foods are always delicious and the service is always top notch. it's also a big plus that they always serve you unlimited bread and butter (believe me that you'll appreciate this when you dip this bread into your soups!)Their Chipotle Bourbon grilled oyster is a MUST try (imagine the butter, butter, and chipotle flavor all come together in your mouth....) and also don't skip the chowder, it's not the typical clam chowder that you'll find everywhere at the Fisherman's Wharf.

The first of three visits to HIOC on this trip.

There is a reason that the queue in is so long and I normally do not queue for anything. I glad queue for this. We were told that the Kumamotos were sold out but we still had a great time. We thought we would try again on our trip to get some at another HIOC. We live in the wrong country.

We have visited Hog Island (on Tomales Bay) on a past visit to CA and were delighted to find the Hog Island Oyster Company location right in the Ferry Building in downtown! What a nice surprise. The selection of oysters was terrific! How great that they offer a number of other dishes like the fish sliders, chowder, yummy fries, etc. The location right on the water can't be beat. Not inexpensive but quality!

One of my favorite SF eateries both for their food and ambience. Grilled oysters are fabulous, and the freshness and quality of their dishes are remarkable. Things can get very expensive very fast whether you are just having a beer and oysters or are there for a meal. If I didn't think it was worth it I wouldn't go back. But I do. Outside of the oysters I recommend the grilled squid salad. Would not recommend the grilled cheese sandwich except as a shared appatizer.

We had a terrific lunch on Saturday. No reservations taken and people line up well in advance of the opening (11:00).The corn salad was so delicious. Corn, avocado, tomatoes and a yogurt lime dressing, and my daughter and I had the oyster po-boy sandwiches - yum!. Oysters perfectly fried and the fries had Old Bay seasoning sprinkles on them. Service was excellent and they even brought a bowl of water for my dog (sat on the patio).So many other things I wanted to try. We'll be back.

Hog Island is very busy and crowded, not surprisingly since the location on the dock is great, and in general so is the food. We sat at the bar, and had a pleasant conversation about the wine list with the bartender, enjoyed a big bowl of excellent sea food chowder, and then shared a grouper special. Everything was FRESH and well prepared, and moderate prices made it a really excellent value. Would definitely go again!

I swung by here during the week when it wasn't too busy and got seated within a few minutes. I had clam chowder (so good) with bread, and then ordered a fried oyster to make a mini DIY po-boy (and i'm oh so glad i did because a full one would've been far too much!). I sat looking over the chefs, which was great fun! Definitely will be back.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I hear the oysters are incredible!

Both locals and tourists alike crowd into the Hog Island Oyster Company at the Ferry Building. We have been there several times and the oysters are always wonderful. We usually share about a dozen oysters on the half shell and get a sampling of whatever is on the menu that day. This time we followed with two Oysters Rockefeller which were to die for!! The server brought us a few rounds of delicious Acme bread to accompany the oysters and topped it off with a crisp wine from Slovenia (sorry, can't remember the name). All while dining along the waterfront with the ferries coming and going. A must if you visit and if you live in the area, you probably already know about it but if not, GO there! Enjoy!

We sat a the bar and ordered different drinks and food, taking our time to visit the rather short menu. Hog Island Oyster Co cultivates its own oysters upstate and they are simply dreamy, briny, creamy and firm and delicate at the same time. We also had a wonderful chowder (it came as a surprise how light and tasty it was) and delicious mussels. We had to drink all the broth as it was just perfect. We had a few craft beers from the tap (an oyster stout - of course - made specially for them) and a few delicious and creative cocktails. We sat a the bar and watching the three bartenders being kept busy by a full house, but always smiling also contributed to a perfect experience. If you like seafood, this is one of the places not to miss in North Beach - Embarcadero (Ferry Building).

Was happy to have a chance to dine here after arriving from the Oakland Amtrak by ferry. It's been on my radar for a while. Thankfully we had no wait because it was less than an hour before closing. Wonderful selection of Pacific oysters - serious raw bar - and roasted oysters and chowder. Service was great and didn't rush us. Prices weren't too bad and worth every penny. With a glass or two of sparkling wine, it was a delicious end of a long day of travel.

First timer here thanks to my brother in law.We were very lucky to have wait for only 20 minutes to get a table for eight on a warm Sunday morning. I said lucky because we saw so many guests had to wait for 45 minutes.We first ordered 2 Oyster Bar Mix (2 dozens each) to be able to try all six different kind of oysters. Then we moved to second and third round with Kumamoto (Humboldt Bay, CA), and Island Creek (Atlantic, Duxbury Bay, WA) which we love the most. The deep cup shell Kummies are sweet and fresh that we could feel the sea taste!The Island Creek is tastier to me and simply the best compared to the others on the plates (menu in photos).We also had Clam Chowder, Butter Clams, and Mussels. All are 8 out of 10.I strongly recommend this place to anyone going to San Francisco and looking for a good place to eat. Especially, for oyster lovers.

This restaurant is located in the Ferry Building at Pier 1. It is a casual spot on the dock side with a great view of the Bay Bridge, especially at night when it is light up. On a Friday night, there was a good mix of locals and tourists. It is nothing like the tourist trap rat race of Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The menu features oysters and at first glance appeared limited. However, give it a chance and you won't be disappointed. The daily special, which changes every day with the local catch, was spectacular (local King Salmon) and their fish/mussel/clam bowls were terrific. You will find something you like because everything we had was absolutely great. Prices are reasonable. Service was top notch, efficient, friendly and genuine with good recommendations. They do not take reservations so the wait could be hit or miss depending on your timing. Try to get a table outside. If I lived in SF, this place would be on my "go to" list.

My husband is on a mission to find the "best" clam chowder. This restaurant has a unique take on this traditional fare. It is more brothy than most. Topped with clams in the shell, the creamy broth is seasoned well with potatoes, carrots and fish pieces. He rated the chowder highly! I am not an oyster lover, so I ordered their rock fish sliders which were delicious. We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and it was busy. They have you form a "line" that encircles an elongated wooden high top table making it easy to visit with other diners and have a beer or share a bottle of wine as you wait. The line moves quickly. They manage the group sizes, inside/outside dining preferences with ease and professionalism. Oh and the views...it is on the back side of the Ferry Building, so you look out on the bay, watching ferries come and go, see the Bay Bridge, pleasure craft, families strolling on the wharf. Lovely evening in every way.

The wait to get in goes quickly - we sat at the oyster bar which is an experience with a lovely view of the bay. My son had a fresh oyster sampler and enjoyed them. We both had the chowder. Now the waitress warned us this isn't your everyday New England clam chowder - it is more brothy and less creamy. The clams come in the shell - now they are plentiful but you have to take them out of the shell yourself. Wasn't really a fan. The chowder had lots of different fish pieces and potatoes and then all those clams. I don't know what it was....maybe just not what I'm used to so not really a "clam chowder" in my mind. It was an experience - probably won't go again as I'm not a fan of the chowder and I don't eat oysters. Service was great!

We tried the clam chowder but I found it a bit watery and somewhat lacking in taste. The mussels were okay. My advise, stick to the oysters, they are fresh and taste great.

Great location with delicious food

We were a little late to enjoy lunch at The Slanted Door, so we decided to try the Hog Island Oyster Company. Fresh and roasted oyster were nice, but not spectacular. The clam chowder was a little different in that it is not thick, but it is perfectly seasoned and has a lot of clams. It was really nice with fresh bread. Servers were friendly and not pushy. Nice location to watch the ferries.

Group of 6 for lunch on a sunny Thursday. Wait was about 30 min but ordered drink while we waited. Service friendly & efficient. Clams very fresh (ask for fresh horseradish). Grilled squid had a beautiful smoky flavour. Ceviche very favourable but cut a but thick. Sliders were a huge hit! Chowder was served a bit cold but waiter changed out immediately. Allergy to muscles in the group which was mentioned - there must have been some cross contamination (clams) as he had a reaction next day. Be careful if you have any seafood allergies. 

The view was amazing....the food, well, not so much....

I commonly come to the Ferry Building, and thought, ok, I'll stand in line to eat there because it had such high ratings. We ordered several items, including the chowder with mussels (which was the worse chowder I've ever had). Every other chowder in the SF Bay visit was better, including the kiosks at the pier. The other seafood was better, but nothing special, yet they were packed. I believe it was more the place to be seen that for its food. Honestly I would not go back. The service was attentive though I will admit.

Stop by here if you're in SF!

This place is inside the Ferry building and on the weekends (especially Saturday when the farmer's market is open), it gets very busy. Be prepared to stand in line but the line moves fairly quickly.Oysters are the must try on the menu. Everything else is great too but you definitely go here for the oysters. I always bring my out of town friends here when they come to visit. Never disappoints!

Great seafood!

My hubby and I enjoyed the oysters very much. Squids were also yummy. Get there early before the peak hours if you don't want to wait for an hour.

had to stand in a line, but so worth it

the food the cocktails and the wine were all awesome. Service was fun and warm. I usually wouldn't stand in a line (who could be bothered) but we ordered a glass of wine and chatted to lovely local people for the short 10 minutes it took to be seated. Try the oysetrs with chorizo jack daniels WOW! We loved the food so much we were in napa Valley and saw another Hog Island and ordered more oysters there.

Some of the best oysters in America if you ask me. Tasty and briny and they will make you randy to boot.

My niece was visiting from NY...wanted to enjoy SF and to have seafood. Having lived in the bay area my whole life, this was the first time we had lunch at the Hog Island Oyster Co. Can't say enough about the great service and the fresh seafood!!! We had the clam chowder...out of this world with whole clams, bacon, vegetables, cream. Best ever ... no comparison to others we've ever had. We also had the Oysters Po' Boy, the Beer Battered Fish sliders, and the Yellowtail crudo. The bloody mary and the magarita were equally good. Great service. Small suggestion to have a larger diameter straw for the bloody mary as the drink is quite robust and delicious. Can't wait to come back soon.

Beer and seafood on the water. What could be better?

While this is a pretty busy place, we arrived a peak dinner time and only waited about 10 minutes for a table. This is a fun place, indoor and outdoor seating. Good for families and groups. Interesting menu and the food was surprisingly good given the high volume of business here.

Great seafood lunch

Wanted a quick light lunch before leaving for the airport. Only short wait for seats. Could have sat outside immediately but it was too hot. Lucky enough to get two seats in front of the kitchen so we could watch the chefs at work. We ordered the oysters chipolte and chorizo and the fried anchovies. Absolutely delicious and friendly service.You must try this place if you are in San Francisco and like seafood.

Don't miss this place

Great food, fun location. Ordered the clams, oysters and corn salad - all were excellent. My son didn't want the clams the way they make them, and they just did a white wine and butter sauce over linguini for him - it was a hit! I would have eaten here more than once if we had had the time.

Awesome

Went again on a recent trip to San Francisco. Their oysters are fresh and delicious. We sat at the bar and ordered 2 dozen assorted oysters. They came with a delicious, vinegary dipping sauce. Then we ordered, what in my opinion, is mandatory when you go to Hog Island Oyster Company. They make the clam chowder to order. Bacon, cream, potatoes, and probably 2 dozen clams in their shells. Probably the most delicious chowder I've eaten. And the grilled cheese. Oh my gosh! So good! The restaurant has grown since I was there last and now there are 2 bars on either side and the seafood bar is in the center. It looks out on the bay, and for those sitting with their back to the water, there are large mirrors that reflect the bay. It is such an enjoyable place. The restaurant is in the Pier Market. Lots of great little shops for meats, cheeses, pastries, and kitchen items. 

Hog on for Oysters!

Traveled from the East Coast to experience Hog Island from a recommendation. I was impressed with the speed of being seated as the restaurant was packed and there was a line to get in. When we were seated the service was good but the real prize goes to the oysters themselves. We selected a few different varieties and each one was exceptional in fresh flavor. The oysters that are cooked are very tasty as well. If you want to up level your experience, head about an hour north of San Francisco and tour the farm.This will satisfy you if you care to learn how they are cultivated and eventually get to your plate. Reservations required.

Heavenly Seafood!

I had heard about this place and since I was in the ferry building area, I decided to stop in for a bite to eat. Stood in line (which goes quickly) for about 15 minutes and then was told I could have avoided it altogether since I was alone. Oh well! I ordered the Chipotle Bourbon oysters with brown sugar, Bourbon, garlic, chipotle and butter along with mussels in a white wine soup and French fries - heavenly! Topped off with an Apricot Sangria. All delicious, and a great way to end a work week!Tip: If alone, don't stand in line, just go to the hostess and tell her you'd like to sit at the bar. It's much faster.

Perfection!!!

The food is delicious. Also the staff is more than friendly and proactive. I recommend the oyster chowder with some champagne. Another option to die for is the crudo and the cheeks fish.

This is popular and busy. We sat at a table for 2 at the back and facing the water. They have outdoor heaters which are essential for outdoor dining in the shade in San Francisco . We really enjoyed here with a good choice of food , nice staff

this is fast becoming a SF favorite for us. Although there is always a line, it moves quickly and the place is large. We sat outside on a beautiful, sunny, warm SF day. We ordered a dozen Sweetwater Tomales Bay Oysters and some grilled oysters with one an d sangria. Highly recommend the chipotle bourbon grilled oysters which were recommended by the waitress.. The sourdough bread basket iso constantly refilled.Couple next door had the red and white fish stew which we intend to try next time!

Best Oysters in the World!

Had the unique opportunity to dine here at the finest table with my Sister and Niece. They know the Manager, who "designed" our dining adventure. Grilled oysters, raw oysters on the half shell, mussels, seafood stew, beet and vodka infused salmon with capers and greens, AK king salmon all with brut rose champagne . Totally DELISH!!!
