We used this place because it was recommended in guide book.It is very nice inside and pizza was nice.It is undercover but partly outside. Pizzas are cooked on a wood burning stove in what looks like a food truck.If you like pizzas its worth checking out,its just down a side street (jones street)just off Jefferson street.It gets you away from the hustle and bustle of Fishermans wharf .

A group of 12 was looking for a fun, quick place to eat. The friendly staff was very helpful in cobbling together enough tables and chairs for us to sit under the outdoor heaters on a very relaxing cool evening. The various pizzas were all excellent. The reviewer complaining about the crust being "a bit burned" apparently misses the fact the pizzas are brick-oven-baked. That's what we were looking for, and that's what we got! Great service and great pizza. Nice combination.

We had 2 pizzas: romantico and American. The romantico was very good but the American crust was a bit burned.We payed almost 50$ for two pizzas and two cokes which is outrageous. No toilet available.Asking for a tip while paying by credit card before you even receive some kind of service or food is ridiculous

Carmel's is basically a trailer located not far from Fishernen's Wharf. There are a few table and they do take out orders. The pizza is very good and includes some with interesting topings. We did takeout for a family dinner back at the hotel. They primarily do pizza and salads.

Read good reviews on here, but for what it is - a heated patio, with garden chairs and tables, and a pizza oven in a shed - it's far too expensive. This isn't really a restaurant. You sit outside, there are no toilets, you order your own food at the hut, the pizzas are over priced and the selection is rather minimal. $41 for two pizzas and 1 soft drink. Pizza crust was impressive, but the rest was rather soggy, due to too much liquid and not enough cheese. Save your money and go elsewhere.

We wanted a quick dinner- and found this little gem of a pizza restaurant. You sit outside with heaters. The decor is really cool- decked out as a ski chalet. The best things though were the pizzas. Absolutely delicious- the dough melts in your mouth and is so tasty. We fought over the crusts!! If you love pizza then definitely come here.

Found this delightful little eatery in a side street off fishermans wharf first impressions it was a cafeteria set up in someone's garden they had a large table for eight with a reserved sign on it I thought " yeah who are you trying to fool "A drinks fridge next to a serving hatch this not the kind of restaurant we were expecting to eat at but we had been traveling all day, tired and just wanted something to eat so we ordered, a little pricey we thought for the surroundings, paid and sat down and waited just as the party of eight turned up along with other customers who were told to return in ten minutes which they duly didWithin minutes the most juicy wood fired pizzas came served to our table I can honestly say I have never eaten a pizza so good before or since Do not let this little oasis pass you by

We visited Carmel Pizza Company based on the reviews from trip advisor. It was very good but we were disappointed with the size. They also didn't put hardly any cheese on the pizza.

I was looking for good pizza places. I stumbled upon the reviews for this place. I had to make a quick decision so I opted for this place based on the great reviews. If you have ever been to pieology, pizza studio, mod pizza etc, this is sort of what you are getting here except its about $20.00 a small looking pizza. My tiny teenage could finish the entire pizza himself and he's not a big eater. Its just a tiny little trailer like the ones you see at the fair. They have little tables and chairs in front to sit and enjoy your food. There were 5 of us and we had to get another pizza just to curb our appetites. And no were are not big people. I should have explored more and tried to find a real pizzeria. The pizza overall tasted good. Its a super thin cracker like crust though.

Read a great review of this place and decided to visit. The heated patio was very much appreciated. We got an Americano but my husband doesn't like mushrooms so got it without. They were also out of black olives so we went without that too. Still it was quite a tasty pie. Later we found out we could have added pepperoni so went back 2 days later, got the Americano with everything plus pepperoni and enjoyed it even more. I love thin crust pizza and this did not disappoint.

Dropped in for an early dinner after reading reviews and as not disappointed. The best pizza I've tasted outside of Italy! Don't worry about American portions, you'll easily eat one per person they're so light. There's no pomp and circumstance, I mean it is essentially a converted food truck with an outdoor courtyard, you pay through a hatch and eat from paper plates but if none of that bother you definitely don't walk past here!

This is a converted food truck with a small seating area. The pizza was very good. I ordered the Margherita and the only disappointment was it needed more cheese. But it was really good nonetheless. Note they are very small pizzas (~12"). They close at 8pm. We got there well before that and were told in no uncertain terms that we could only order a pizza to-go. Didn't want to but ok we were there so fine. Of course you know what happens when you carry a pizza box around in a neighborhood with a large homeless population. I should have ordered more than one tiny pizza.

Very tasting ingredients, high quality for sure, and super crunchy pizza base. Lovely. Wood oven makes always a big difference, but you have to count on good raw materials as well. And that's the case.I drunk a San Pellegrino arancia + fico d'India that was unique: I'm going back to Italy and look for it. The place is lovely. Sweet and a bit hippy-style that makes you feel in peace with the rest of the world. People are nice, service is good. What else??Yes, prices are not that cheap but hey, that's Frisco, guys! I would pay even more for such a good vibe experience.

I work near this small open air venue. It's great for a quick bite and has some of the best pizza in the area in my opinion (coal fired type crust). The menu is small, but has something for everyone - meat, veggie, classic cheese. One pie is enough to feed two people - or one if you're really hungry. It's a little on the pricey side for what you get, but you won't be upset. My coworkers and I visit regularly and it's not usually overrun with tourists. We've always found a table in their small dining area.

On our day and a half visit to San Francisco, while walking around the Fisherman's Wharf area, my wife and I were craving pizza from a small, quaint shop. We happened upon Carmel Pizza and it looked like the type of place we were envisioning. Not as good as we had hoped though. They only had one size of pizza which they had an example of lying beside the counter. When we got ours it seemed quite smaller than the example. We ordered pepperoni and, though I didn't count them, I don't believe there was more than 12 pieces or so of pepperoni on the whole pizza. The crust was paper thin and very flimsy except out by the edges. It was so thin it was impossible to hold it in your hand. You had to eat it with a plastic knife and fork. They do not have fountain drinks but have a cooler of various canned and bottled sodas and drinks in a cooler where you order. We got the single pepperoni pizza and two bottles of Coke and paid a little over $24. That is not too bad for a good, hearty pizza but was a very poor value for what we got. It was so thin and skimpy that we ate the whole thing and were still hungry. That was the only time I have ever eaten pizza anywhere and left still hungry. We literally walked around the corner when we left and ordered another meal from a fish and chips place. The pizza did taste good but just not much of it especially for the price.

We were told the order would be ready in 10 minutes, and we left from our hotel to make the pickup. When we arrived after about a five minute walk, our order was ready.Quick friendly service. I was taken a back when the cashier offered me the option of adding a tip to my total. Since I walked ten minutes round trip to get the pizza and did not have table service in the restaurant, it seemed to be an odd request. The dining area is small, although tables were available. Also it seemed that all the tables were outside, which given the cool evening would not have been pleasant.That said the pizza was very good. We ordered the Americano, and it seemed light on the meat toppings - apple smoked ham and sausage. Nevertheless, the flavor was fine and the thin crust properly done.Given the coolness of the evening, the pizza was not hot when we returned to the room. But that is not the fault of Carmel Pizza. A 50 degree night in San Francisco in mid-July.On balance a good choice given our objectives for the evening.

Spot on!

Outstanding thin-crust pizza, produced in a small caravan-sized kitchen surrounded by limited seating. The pizzas are all medium-sized and reasonably priced. Many of the toppings - such as anchovy, parmesan - are thrown on after cooking, which we liked.

A sincere review from an Italian point of view (just amazing)

First things first. I'm Italian, I live in Italy and I love pizza, I've began to learn how to prepare doughs for pizzas 15 years ago and took a course on how to prepare bread and pizza (in Italy), and I've regularly prepared pizza once a week for some years now.Having said that, I was at the beginning of a coast to coast ride from San Francisco to Miami (july 2016) and I found this place by chance using tripadvisor.From a personal point of view, this is one of the top three pizzas I've ever had in my life (considering all the Italian pizza I had in Italy).The ingredients are excellent but the dough....guys this is pure art.When I finished my pizza I asked to Amanda, the girl who served us, the story of the place and I discovered that she was (is) the owner of the pizzeria and the artist (this level cannot be considered cooking)!One small, but important, technical detail for perfectionist: this is not a 100% neapolitan pizza. The dough is less chewy than a traditional neapolitan pizza (for me this is a plus, but it is a matter of taste).Two minor things: 1) the crust may be a bit burnt in some points, but this is a typical things for pizzas that are cooked with wooden fire (and I believe for less than 90 seconds); 2) the selection of beers is very limited (and personally, I'd not add an Italian beer to the menu).This is and will be a 5 star for ever.

street pizza fun!

Ate here two different nights while in SF for 6 nights; Wood Fired pizza--very good or excellent gourmet toppings selection--kid and adult friendly; small dining area is exposed to out side elements within 3 walls and open air along 4th wall; heaters blow warm air on a cool evening--comfortable! Friendly quick service about 10 min; pizzas I believe were only available in one size about 14"? Prices $15-$20.

Great pizza

It was so delicious, I ate more than I even thought I could. It was so good, but the staff seemed a little annoyed when I asked them for anything. 

Fun place for a quick wood fired pizza

Carmel pizza serves great wood fired pizzas! I originally thought it was a restaurant when I looked at them on trip advisor, however when we went I discover it was a food truck. It's in a permanent location, but doesn't have indoor seating or a extensive menu of items. That would not defer me from visiting then again!! The pizza was delicious, the staff was nice, and the atmosphere was exciting since we can people watch while eating!
