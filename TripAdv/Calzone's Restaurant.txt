Every time I come to San Fransisco I stop here to eat , everything I have ever had here is great . Today I had my best dish ever , mushroom and sausage campenini . . It tried to look and see all the ingredients that were in it because i want to eat this at home . I also had the seared scallops , I was worried that the wasabi anoli would be too hot , it was not hot or spicy at all but very tasty .

Ok. But good service for sure

This restaurant was recommended by a relative who lives in the area. We tried the house lasagna which did not disappoint. Just as advertised "in the heart of North Beach". Outdoor seating is available in front of the restaurant. I would definitely go back if given the chance.

Cute restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Great people watching restaurant, every tale has a few of the front sidewalk whether direct or through the mirrors.We had garlic cheese bread, garlic bread, pizza and sandwiches. Everything tasted wonderful. I would have loved to have tried the Gnocchi, I hear it is wonderful but we already had so many items, maybe next time.

I recently visited this North beach restaurant and had a pleasant outdoor eating experience. It was fun people watching in a relaxing sidewalk atmosphere.My dining partner had delicious garlic fries and a healthy portion of fresh bruschetta, while I had the signature calzone. Although a tad pricey the food was good and as mentioned the view was great.

Spotted this restaurant from the bus on our way to the wharf!! Looked extremely busy everytime we passed so thought it must be good! After reading reviews, thought we would give it a try. I made a booking through opentable which was really easy. Got a great table looking out to the street. All the food was excellent and value for money. Would definitely recommend!

We loved our meal at Calzone's Restaurant. My lasagna was perfect! I love it crispy and they accommodated me. My husband loved his mixed seafood grill the mashed potatoes were a little different with zucchini in them. I could not taste my son's pizza because he inhaled it. The service was good. We sat inside because there was no wait. Next time, I want to sit on the cute tables on the sidewalk.

We popped here on a Sunday night for a bite to eat after a long day sight seeing. Seated straight away outside, tables are very cramped and close together.I wasnt too hungry so ordered the chicken sandwich, which arrived in good time. On first look it looked great however, there was something not right about the chicken... it was the toughest chewiest chicken ive ever had in my life. I managed to get through half the sandwich (with the help of a lot of mayo). Decided to take a bite of the 2nd half of the sandwich and bit straight into a piece of griscle. So gross. I decided to cut the chicken into smaller pieces to make it a little more managable but cutting it seemed to be hard work so that was me done. I was completly put off and left 70% of my meal. I left the chicken in full view waiting for the waiter to ask how our food was or was there a problem but nope he lifted the plates as quick as anything and was gone without a word. Charged $15 for less than half a meal has left me less than impressed. Not my best meal while staying in SF.

After seeing Beach Blanket Babylon went back to our hotel and while walking along Columbus Ave happen to see this restaurant open for dinner. Even though it was late they were open till 1 am that was on Saturday night, we happened to get a table on the sidewalk for dinner, and the outside temperature was fantastic for the city that night. Great food, and quick service would recommend dining here if you have the opportunity. Restaurant offers a great atmosphere for dining right on the street. I had the artichoke raviolis and they were delicious the meat sauce was fantastic it reminded me of when I was a kid and ate at my Italian grandmother's house. Service was spectacular didn't feel like we were rushed enjoyed some mojitos with dinner. Looks like this place is always busy but plenty of room for seating. Would love to try the pizza next time.

I'm torn writing this review. The food was amazing. I ordered shrimp Alfredo when I received it there were four or five shrimp sitting on top and I thought OK that's pretty generous. But oh no there were tons more shrimp buried underneath the pasta which is not typical. Our table also ordered the pizza which is the super thin crispy crust pizza very tasty. However the service....not sure what was going on, if it was shift change or if they had just opened for lunch but it took quite a while for someone to come to even bring us water. And when we were first seated we were seated at a table with four chairs which would normally be fine, however at that point we had already walked 3 miles that day, so I asked for a booth seat. I guess by moving from one section to the other we moved out of our waitresses zone if you will, I don't think she appreciated that. It nothing to do with her it was strictly out of my comfort level.

We had a party of eleven and had a fun night! We were seated upstairs in a small space with a long narrow table. It was a very private space. We ordered food family style and shared several pizzas, appetizers and salads. And wine and beer. Our waiter was very attentive and was diligent about removing our many empty plates. After most of the food was consumed, we tried a calzone and a meatball sub. Everything was very delicious. It felt like we tried everything on the menu, but we didn't! There is seating outside, facing the street as well as more tables downstairs. When I visit San Francisco again, I'll definitely return and try items we missed on the menu!I recommend this restaurant for both large parties as well as romantic date nights!

Amazing!! Definitely go here!!

Four of us had dinner here after seeing Beach Blanket Babylon. The place was, as always, quite crowded. Service was quick and efficient since they want to turn over the tables to accommodate more diners. But as fast as our meals came out, the food was quite good. We all had different dishes and no one had anything negative to say about any of the food. Prices are typical in North Beach, just a little on the high side, but not at all unreasonable. We were in and out in under an hour, even with our bottle of wine. My suggestion would be to hold off placing any order for the next course until you are ready, IF you are interested in lingering over dinner in such a colorful and inviting dining room.

We had dinner here after hitting the sights in San Fran and it was great! The three of us split a calimari appetizer, one pizza, and one calzone and it was plenty. The prices were a tad on the high side but overall it was a great meal with great views inside and outside the restaurant. Parking, as always in San Fran, can be a hassle so we parked at the North Beach Garage, which is only a short walk from the restaurant. We loved eating here and will definitely visit again when we are in San Fran. Great food & location, good service -you can't ask for much more!

The charm of the outdoor tables for two caught us on our Little Italy walk and we were drawn in to ask for a table. We were seated immediately at the only remaining table but there we sat for about 10 minutes before so much as a hello from the waitstaff. They were literally running to and fro. The place was totally packed and we walked in on a Friday night at about 7. So I guess we were lucky to get a table and we'll leave it at that.Once we received our reasonably priced bottle of Malbec ($35) and the typical crusty bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar (part of the table settings) we were happy campers.The heirloom tomato salad featured about 5 different types of tomatoes plus avocados and a dressing and herbs that gave it a perfectly seasoned flavor. The tomatoes were all different colors and textures. It was a large salad that we shared. Would have been kind of large for 1 person as an appetizer. We also split the eggplant and mushroom calzone. It tasted freshly made and was crusty and satisfying and would have been huge for 1. We were totally full and our bill before tip wine included was $65! Seemed cheap for San Fran.Once the sun went down it got a little chilly so we were happy they had electric overhead heaters tucked up under the awnings. We weren't in a rush, and once the service started we enjoyed an un- rushed pace. The staff were all super friendly and professional just maybe could have used a few more waiters. We'd definitely return.

We were winding our way back to our hotel after seeing Beach Blanket Babylon and stopped here on the spur of the moment. Neither of us was in the mood for a full or lengthy Italian meal (which MUST be amazing here!) so we opted, respectively, for a meat ball sandwich and a cheeseburger, of all things.I ate the latter ... every single bite. The burger was presented in a perfect slice of a very fresh baguette with perfectly done fries tossed with prodigious quantities of fresh, finely chopped garlic. Oh ... my ... gods. Next time, we'll be sure to make the time for a longer and more traditional Italian experience.

Dinner at Calzones's was to die for. 4 of us dining and we were all in agreement that this is one of the best Italian meals we have ever had. That is saying something given the 4 of us traveled through Italy 12 months ago. The boys both had house made Lasagne, the girls shared a Margarita Pizza which came as a long narrow pizza not a traditional round one. If you a hanging out for an Italian meal some time in San Fran you can not go wrong here, there are plenty of options to choose from in San Fran and some of them are pretty average. This is not.

 My wife and I were walking through Lil Italy and came across this place for lunch. Most of the sidewalk tables were full so we went inside and found a booth. The restaurant was decorated with Italian grocery store items, salamis and cheeses. The color scheme was red, white and black. The wait staff was very nice and brought us bread and olive oil while we were looking over the menu. I ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink and they brought a full glass plus a small carafe for a refill. My wife ordered an espresso and loved it. We looked over the menu and decided to share a calzone. We got the Italian which was stuffed with lots of different Italian meats, baby artichokes, tomatoes and mozzarella. The bread crust was crisp but very light. It was so good I wish I had room to order and eat another one. Our hotel was in this area and we went by this place four or five times during our trip. Each time we went by at different times of the day and the restaurant was always busy. It was a great place and we will come back here the next time we visit San Francisco.

Came out from early evening performance of Beach Blanket Babylon, our party was in the mood for Italian! The fettuccini was home made! To die for. A little disappointed that there was no garlic dipping oil for the bread; the waiter gave us some crushed garlic to mix with oil, but is wasn't the same. The same waiter chased me down when I accidently left my credit card in the bill folder!

Went there with my husband today for dinner. We had had a disaster of a first day in San Francisco and was not feeling the love.Then we went in to calzones. It is a nice busy little restaurant but we did not feel like we were squeezed in. I had scallops to start and husband had crab bruschettta. The scallops were well cooked but the bruschettta was gorgeous light but crisp bread with the perfect balance of toppings. I was glad we agreed to share.Main course was a calzone for me and my other half had fettuccine with ragu and meatballs. My calzone was perfectly balanced with ingredients and the mozzarella was creamy and gorgeous. Again though hubby picked best. Normally when eating pasta and meatballs it can get a bit boring but he did not find this the case. And with the tastes I got I can honestly say single best dish of our vacation. (We are on day 15 now 3rd city)If you are in the Italian part of San Francisco give this place a go. Lots of hustle and bustle with good food.

Recently visited with my family and everything we tried was delicious ( bruschetta, gnocchi, pasta with salmon and the best was the meat lasagna). The staff and the service couldn't be better.

It was one of those gorgeous sunny Sunday afternoons in North Beach and the opportunity to sit on the sidewalk and have lunch sounded like the perfect idea. Service was great, Sangria was refreshing, heirloom tomato salad was really good & fresh, the seared bacon wrapped sea scallops were ok (I wasn't a fan of the wasabi sauce underneath) & we wanted a side of meatballs which they couldn't do so we had to pay the full price for a meatball sandwich without the bread & they were very delicious and a good size portion. It was a really nice spot.

The restaurant is lovely. The waitstaff was awesome, but if you are coming here fine Italian cuisine, I would recommend trying one of the many others close by. I had a pizza that by all accounts was the most boring, dry, tasteless pizza I have ever had. I wanted a pasta dish but nothing sounded overly exciting so I tried the pizza. After a bite, I knew I had made a mistake. Now, I would highly recommend getting a glass of wine outside and enjoy the atmosphere. Again, ambience is awesome. Food is lacking.

Three English families on three separate holidays meet for Christmas Day 2016 lunch at Calzones. A long and happy meal with good service was had by all.Two families pay with cash, one by card. The latter get back to the UK to discover that the total amount for the meal had been taken from the card. No receipt, no proof was kept. Alas was the word that sort of sprang to mind. Feeling naively hopeful, yet sighing knowingly at the futility of it all an email was sent to the Manager, explaining the situation. Within a couple of days $346 was refunded to the card. What else can be said? Taking time out to read an email, to investigate, to refund the money. That is worth its weight in gold. I would recommend Calzones to everyone. Thank you Giovana Diaz and all your hard working colleagues.

Fancy, beautiful place, well decorated, nice setting... however, nobody sits here to stare to the walls, right? If you are like me and come here to eat, you may agree that this food is mean, regular, nothing especial at all. I had a prosciutto and arugula pizza that was cold! My son had a pasta that was ok, according to him. My wife had a Caesar salad with chicken and drops of Caesar sauce... completely different experience that I had yesterday in the Italian Homemade Factory (located two or three blocks down in the same street). In this case, I am being really nice when I give 3 stars to Calzone's... almost a tourist trap...

It is a perfect place to eat (crab fettuccine alfredo is my favorite plate) with your boyfriend or friends. This bistro has a large awning along the front with tables and chairs beneath it, perfect for watching the crowd go. I loved this place.

Good home made pasta

The comfort here is great. Outdoor seating with heat. People watching is big. Food like the house made campanelle with salmon is delicious. Salads are lacking is dressing but very fresh ingredients. Desserts are yummy. Prices a little high but this is Columbus Avenue. Service is slow and deliberate. 

Great quality food ...Excellent friendly service.

One of the bes italiant restaurants in SF I found. I my opinion better than most places I've dined at in Italy. Try the Alfredo. 

Excellent Homemade!

If gnocchi is on a menu, I'm ordering it! So of coarse I had to order the homemade gnocchi...which was excellent. My husband had a calzone, figuring since the place is called Calzone's it better be good. It was THE best calzone we ever tasted! It was light, not too doughy, the filling was tasty. Service was extremely fast, friendly, and welcoming. We'll be back!

Visiting nephew from out of town. Nice Italian meal. Casual ambiance. Limited beverage menu. Food was very rich. A little cramped. Too cold for outdoor seating which would have probably been more fun. Friendly staff.

Good food and good service

This area of North Beach has many choices for Italian food. It wasn't a hugh place, but there was adequate seating including outdoor seating. The food was very good and the prices were reasonable. The service was attentive. It was nice to see the government "cost of doing business" surcharge was included in the price of the meal. A lot of other places don't do that so when you get your check, between that and the high sales tax, your bill goes up by about 15% without the tip. They are smart not to do that. I was more inclined to give the server a better tip since I wasn't seeing all the add ons I had to pay. The menu has a good variety.

Nice food, love the decoration but avoid bathroom

Ate here twice during trip. Once outside under terrace heaters. Great location. Pizza was delicious, superbe crust. Service first time acceptable, second time great. Second dinner lamb sirloin, good pick! Decoration is nice feels Italy. Good espresso but need to ask for heated cups. 

Good - but not a fave!

Great little restaurant, we made a reservation otherwise you might have a wait to get in. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. I just wanted regular spaghetti with meat sauce but it did not seem to be on the menu. I did enjoy my Italian pot stickers though. 

Amazing

We found this on a walk back from the Port to Union Square area. It was a clear day and managed to gain a sidewalk table. Service and food were excellent. Highly recommend their pizzas!

Great little restaurant in the North Beach area with good food at reasonable prices. With a name like Calzone's I had to try the calzone and it was great.

Good pizza

Calzone's is a big italian restaurant and does not have the charm of its fellow italians in the neighbourhood, but it serves a very good pizza. Not cheap but I guess nothing comes cheap in this city.... Service was good and quick. 

So good we visited twice

My husband and I visited Calzone's twice during our visits to San Francisco. The first was by accident after being turned away from another popular pizza place nearby. I'm glad we did! For our first visit we were sat immediately, I had the sausage trio pizza whilst my husband had a calzone. We were too full for anything else and my leftovers were bagged up. We visited again on a Saturday at the end of our California tour as my husband requested to go here for our final supper. It was much busier this time and we waited for approx 20 mins at the bar. This time round we both had the combo pizza. On both occasions the pizza was so good, thin crispy base with the right amount of topping and cheese. Second time round we managed dessert, I had the chocolate dome cake which is served with mint cream-not as sweet as ice cream and delicious. Would definitely come back for more rounds of pizza.

We ate here on a busy Sunday night. No children's menu or offer of half portions, so kids must order a $20+ entree as well. We ordered a couple pizzas - very thin cracker crust pizza and pasta. The pasta was definitely better than the pizza. We are a family that travels frequently and we were all non-plussed with this restaurant. The atmosphere was a bit chaotic and tables quite close together.

Went here with a colleague for a late bite after late meetings. Ordered a pizza and a few beers. Pizza was terrible, small, limp, bland. Was only place open at 11-ish on a wed night. Service was poor and the place was dirty. Glad we didn't get sick. Would not go again, probably a touristy place, trap.

Good food, good service. Calzone was delicious but needed more dough. Scallops were good, wasabi aioli was a little strange.

It was a busy night and we were able to get a table at Calzone's. The food was good and the server was attentive, but not overly so. We enjoyed our meal in the funky upstairs area and found the prices not too bad for a San Francisco restaurant. Would recommend it.

Super let down on our pizza's all around

We wanted to have dinner in Little Italy and the only table we could find was at Calzone's. We ordered 3 pizza and sadly I cant say any of us had a good meal. Extremely thick & doughy, incredibly dry and completely bland. We tried throwing everything on to make it more edible but we eventually left and went to find a take out on the way home. Really disappointing for our one night in San Francisco. Choose wisely & book a good restaurant in advance especially on a Saturday night. They also only had one toilet for the entire restaurant so the queue was long and led between the tables. Toilet filthy and later even blocked. Poor standards guys.

Delicious Food, Great Ambiance!

Calzone's was a great place to have delicious food and people watch in the Italian district of San Francisco. We chose outdoor seating on a beautiful cool night and weren't disappointed. The food, we had pizza and calzone, was spot on! Drinks from the full-service bar were great and the service, even on a busy Saturday, was great! We'll be going back next time we're in San Francisco!

The food was good and the service was great. We ate at one of the tables outside and loved the people watching. The prices were pretty good for San Francisco.
