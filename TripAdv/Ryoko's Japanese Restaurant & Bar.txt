very busy place even you come to there late. so expect to wait a bit, but their turnover is pretty ok. we waited about 20 minutes to sit, the waiter did mess up our place in queue and we had to remind him. rather than that, the service was pretty good. food was excellent, very authentic and creative - unique combination. we ordered Pokemon, jumping unagi, jumping tuna, spider roll, Crunchy Crab, a few others. all taste very good.

I found this restaurant based on the TripAdvisor review. I arrived around 7:15 and was able to get seated at the sushi counter. The restaurant was packed but not the peak busy time. Service was just ok and could be more attentive. I think the restaurant is slightly under staff which affected the services negatively. The hamachi sushi which were freshly delivered from Japan, were very good, though not cheap. The teriyaki rib eye was delicious with rice & miso soup ordered separately. I was satisfied with my meal at reasonable price. The sushi& sashimi seem pricey. By the time I finished my dinner, there was long queue waiting near the counter. It was a bit noisy with loud music & staff were shouting whenever people arrived and left. Definitely will recommend local to try but for tourist, good to have if you are eager for Japanese food. 

I absolutely loved it

They have a couple of great ingredients:- fresh fish- great ideas- great ambiance I absolutely loved it, the sushi/sashimi/roles (what every you call them) tasted wonderful . We've been sitting on the bar right opposite of the chefs so we order by this fish and just make something out of it and we didn't get disappointed, in fact every new piece was an new surprise and tasted absolutely gorgeous. I will go again, highly recommended.

We ordered wakame su, karaaage, plain rice and shiitake tempura...all of these were delicious. They also serve alcohol and drinks. There was a queue when we entered for dinner and were greeted by a loud voice by the chefs. The food was super tasty..very much like you get in japan. I juat found the music to be too lous otherwise the staff was very courteous and helpful. Service was quick too!

Prices are well worth what you are served... the staff was very courteous... we ate until they closed down and it was a great experience... Definitely going back and recommending to friends...

This place reminded me of the basement restaurants in Tokyo and the food was just as good. So expect a dimly lit environment, almost like a nightclub vibe (but it works). They also play dance type music which is a bit random but might bother some people as it's a bit loud. We shared 3 starters (edamame, chicken karaage, baby octopus) and the sashimi platter and drank sake and beer. All delicious. The service was excellent and friendly. People were lining up as we were leaving. This place lives up to the good reviews.

I discovered this place when looking for a late dinner near Union Square. I visited on Thursday night at about 11 and they had a DJ. The sushi is good. I also tried the teriyaki steak starter. The steak is a Ribeye and was very good as well. San Francisco has limited late dining options and this one is a rare find. I will visit again.

You walk down the stairs into this below street level sushi restaurant, and you are greeted loudly by all the employees! This is NOT your typical sushi bar! There is techno dance music blasting, and on the wall are pictures of Jimi Hendrix, and John Coletrane. Doors open at 6pm, and by 6:45pm there's a wait for a table. But service is quick and friendly, and the sushi is fresh and delicious. Prices are good but portion sizes are slightly small. The rainbow roll and checkerboard roll were particularly good! Fried cheese appetizer was great for my non-sushi eating kiddo. If you can handle the nightclub vibe, this is a great sushi restaurant to try!!

Walked past this restaurant and was lured in by the funky disco music and bustling, lively atmosphere inside. As we walked down the stairs we were greeted by a warm welcome! from the chefs. We arrived at 6 (the opening hour) and were surprised that the place was already half full!The service was very attentive from the moment we arrived to us leaving the restaurant. The music choice and decor gave this place a quirky and fun vibe. The sushi was honestly the best sushi I have ever had. I have not been to Japan but this was some seriously good food and the fact that place seems to always be busy must be a testament to this. Must visit in SF

I ate here twice. Once was nothing short of fabulous (comparable to upper end restaurants in Osaka or Kyoto) and once just ok. Price is definitely more $$$ than $$.This place always has a line, even at 11:30pm on a Wednesday. Food is variable (not only my limited experience, but the word from people in the neighborhood). I would expect the quality of maguro and toro to change from day to day, but was surprised by the variability in unagi. Suggestion: go LATE when it is less of a zoo.

Went there at 9p Sunday evening. The line was out the door. We decided to wait and it was totally worth it. Our kids ate with us. We had the beef teriyaki and tofu to start - both great. The sushi was amazing. The fish just melted when you ate it. The place is dark, loud, and full of activity. The sushi is just truly worth it.

Were we here on an off night? We walked to the Union Square area from the Financial District even tho we passed maybe 6 other sushi places along the way because of the excellent TA reviews. Wish we hadn't skipped the places along the way. We were there on Friday night so we knew there would be a wait. Walked down the steps and put our name for a table of 4 on the list. Was able to ask about how long the wait might be so we could maybe get a drink across the street while we wait. She said maybe 20 mins to an hour. Not wanting to loose our spot we decide to wait, but she doesn't offer to have us order a drink there to not leave, I made the choice on my own. 20 minutes later and no one waiting had been seated so we ask about ordering a beer and sake while we wait and she seems so put off by the idea of it. She does bring the drinks, the bottle of beer and the sake, both barely chilled. Should have been tipped off there. After waiting 1 hour we were seated downstairs in the second tiny room and it was dark and very warm in there. A bus boy came by and turned the floor fan on and I turned it toward our table so that helped. A pitcher of beer and some hamachi sushi to start to try it out. Both warm. Yes warm beer and warm fish, dry fish and no flavor fish. Geez. Our friends are unfazed and I know we have to stay. I order octopus sushi. They are out but have baby octopus for $9.60 for 2 pieces. Guess what? It was mushy and slimmy and not even a light squeeze of lemon to enhance the flavor? We also tried the hamachi belly because we do love yellowtail and maybe the belly would be good, not the case. The kicker...no tuna tonight but they belly or blue fin at $16.90 per order. However we ordered the checkerboard roll, one of the few non fried rolls and it was topped with hamachi and yes you guessed it...tuna. So tuna on the rolls is available but not as sushi. Yes the place was packed, our server was niceish, although slow and there is a dj that starts at 9pm and gives the place a nice vibe. The fish selection was minimal. They claim theirs is fresh fish from Japan but won't serve us tuna and don't have a snapper option or white tuna or albacore in on a Friday? The roll selection was super boring so many were fried or had a cooked element, that is not traditional Japanese sushi. I hope we were here on an off night because after reading all the positive reviews I almost wondered if we were in the right restaurant.

We were recommended to come here by the lovely barman at the Westin St Francis and were so glad we did. A short wait then a table at the sushi bar and some of the best food we've had anywhere in the US. Tempura was light and delicious.

Came highly recommended by friends, so we weren't surprised, but it was as good as advertised.Opens at 6PM and doesn't take reservations. We got there at 5:58 and saw about 30 people in line, but the place is big enough to fit all of them and us and a few folks after us. By 6:15 there was definitely a line up the stairs, though!Huge menu, we had the octopus and some sake sashimi (so good!). Also the Jumping Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Volcano (jalapeno and peanut butter ?!?!) and a couple other rolls. Quite reasonably priced as well.

Knowing they do not take reservations, we took a chance on Sunday for dinner. We were seated in the downstairs dining. The long counter had the better view of the sushi preparation, but we preferred a table.One caterpillar and one dragon roll were enough to satisfy us. I had a Sapporo draft. We paid $35 plus tip.Nothing to complain except for three homeless men bedding down a few yards away.

The sushi here is extremely fresh, and you can taste it in each bite. The only problem here is that they have just your standard fare of sushi, with little special type rolls. If you have never been here it can be confusing, you have to go in and write your name down, then they call you when they have space. We had three people and they sat us down next to the piano at a two person table with a tiny stool for the third seat. It was very uncomfortable. Service was mediocre.... I still liked this place despite the criticisms, but I do not think it would be high on my repeat list.

Very loud, sleazy crowd, poor menu options. The guy and the girl at the table next to us were hanging all over each other the whole time we were there. There was no crab on the menu-- only imitation crab. Not a good sign. We ordered drinks and appetizers to judge whether we should stay for dinner. Drinks were good, but the shrimp tempura only included two pieces of shrimp and the salmon sashimi was not great. We got the check and got out of there asap. Plenty of other good sushi options in San Fran. Don't waste your time here.

I absolutely love this place! We got there just in time before the rush, but we still waited about 35-minutes. However, the servers were so nice. They took care of us while we were waiting and let us order hot sake shots, which made the wait bearable. The food was delicious. We ordered the Chirashi, which is the chef's selection of fish. This was good and the fish was very fresh. The rice was perfect. Make sure you order raw wasabi, which enhances your sushi experience. The best things we tried were the orange delight and the uni. By far, hands down, no doubt about it, best uni I have ever tried in my life. The unagi was great as well. Service was fast and friendly. Love the atmosphere. Food was great. Overall, I would definitely go back.Happy Dining, J Tran

First of all, I would like to say that I will only comment the service here as we haven't had the chance to taste the food there after what happened to us...This restaurant was highly recommend to us, so we went there (4 colleagues). After waiting 20 min for a table (putting our name on a list) the waitress let us know that there is a table ready, so we go there and start checking the menu. After 5 min at our table, the waitress comes back and tell us that she made a mistake and the table was actually booked for another group... and she asks us to stand us and leave the table to wait probably another 20-25min for another table- and we saw the another group of (lucky) people.Needless to say that we left immediately ! What a terrible terrible service, and not even a "I'm sorry, I will offer you a drink or something..."This place is trendy and the food is probably very good, but the service really has to improve !!

We arrive at 715; there is a queue all the way down the steps into the restaurant where still more people are waiting. To let them know we have arrived we push to the front of the queue in order to write our name on the clipboard at the bottom of the steps. If you're British, do not wait politely at the back of the queue as this is missing the point. They do not take reservations.The restaurant is heaving and beset by pounding dance music and the place is not in any way sumptuous, indeed it could do with a lick or two of paint. Sound terrible? Well it's amazing.The staff are wonderful, keeping a wonderful sense of humor despite the constant questions from the waiting diners. We went to the Owl Tree bar across the road for a drink and returned at 7:45, were called at 7:50, and out first food arrived at 8:00. The service is super efficient but you never feel under pressure. I left at 9:00 feeling very happy with my dinner and good about the organisation in the place. The queue had pretty much died down by the time I left, butwhen I went last Sunday, the queue had gone by 8pm. The food is very good. I agree with some of the other reviewer's that this is perhaps not the absolute best sushi I've ever had but the eel nigiri was incredible and worth going for on its own. All the rest was a bonus - very fresh edamame- and it was a very good bonus. I will definitely return as this was a real foodie experience. I never queue for a restaurant, until now apparently.

I was having an 8 hour layover in San Francisco on my way to Austin, Texas and have decided to take the BART from the airport to downtown. I used to go to high school north of SF and so was quite familiar with the city. Got off on Powell and Market and walked around Union Square and such. Had an appetite for Japanese and found out 2 of the 3 highly recommended restaurants were all packed in the area. This was my last of the 3 and there was a short line up at the door. Lucky enough, they had a corner seat at the sushi bar and I sat down almost immediately. Ordered "Omakase" Sashimi with no budget in mind and saw they had a good selection of fish from Tsukiji, Japan. The sashimi plate was very good indeed, very good quality fish and fresh. The restaurant was very crowded and mostly were couples or friends, patrons in the 30's. After the Sashimi plate, I've told the chef to make me a Negitoro handcone. My gosh, this is the BEST I've ever had. They put some sort of yellow daikon diced up and used "O Toro" the fattest part of the Tuna and chopped up, the oil keep dripping down the end of the cone and it was a true pleasure to eat. Had many of these in my life and I was impressed with this, I would say a MUST Try if you visit this place.

I had a nice experience at Ryoko, the moment i stepped in, walked downstairs, I was in love. I like how intimate the environment was with the dimmed lights, nice hip music, and friendly welcome. It was me and a girlfriend and we were seated at the bar. I walked around to see the rest of the joint, they had a piano, the low ceilings makes it feel cozy. Ambiance was a good plus. Especially that altho they had good music, we could hear each other and not scream lol.The food was delicious. We ordered a few simple things (when it comes to sushi, i like simpler orders like sashimi so i can taste the fish) and it came out fresh and tasty. The server was super friendly and attentive the entire time. The bill was not bad at all considering SF has a higher price point.I noticed the long line along the staircase but it was moving. Not sure if they take reservations. There are parkings around the street as well but this was a 3 min walk from where i stayed (Touchstone hotel). I would love to come back here with a group of friends as it looks like it would be a fun place for groups as well. I noticed they had corner nooks for parties of 4-6 towards the back of the room which is nice. I think its suitable for solo travelers too, there a few sitting by the sushi bar and they were making friends with other solo travelers so i think its nice. I wouldnt have minded sitting there alone. Its a nice environment for it. I saw someone order the oysters which looked good too.All in all. Id definitely come back.

Everything from the decor to the DJ set up on the piano spinning 90s hits says this place is pretty offbeat. Me and my girlfriend both agreed it's a fun place. It would be good for a birthday or any night out with friends The food was spot on. The sushi was fresh and delicious. We had a few rounds of rolls and sashimi of which none disappointed. The prices weren't too shocking either by san fran standards. If you're planing on visiting I'd reccomend getting there early. We arrived for 8 and were seated immediately. Not long after the line was out the door. It is a little cramped inside but I'm kind of a tall guy so I wont take a star off for that.

Sushi spot near Union Square. Had a bouncer out front. I found that odd. As you enter, you will descend about 6 steps into a dark basement Sushi Dive. When I entered there were about 8 patrons waiting for a table and seated on the steps. No hostess per say, but other patrons directed me to the list. While all that sounds slightly alarming, there is a good reason for it. The sushi and staff are awesome, so there is standing room only while the staff scurries about madly bringing order to the chaos. DJ was spinning. Drinks were flowing ( full liquor bar, beer , sake). Younger crowd. Open til like 0100. Sushi chefs were awesome and fun. Guy next to me at the bar had a special cut of fish prepared to order on the grill. No problems. Waitresses, Patty and Poko, were sweet and efficient. Sushi was delicious.

Nice restaurant. Ate here sushiplatter but there was no sushirolls at all in the platter. Platter was also a bit small event thought we asked waitress if it would be enought for two people. Service was friendly anyway. Would not came here again.

This is hands down one of the best sushi places I've been- that including Japan. The miso soup is the best ever - ok, it may be just a soup, but when its great it makes a difference. The tuna was fantastic, and they have a wide range of rolls, all very tempting. The price may fluctuate from whats on the menu due to market prices, especially the tuna, but it's worth it. we were sad at the end because we just wanted more of that great food.

I have been coming here for years - not sure if it is the same owner but the energy and atmosphere was great fun. Not a great place for a quiet business dinner but acoustics were such that we could have a discussion.

The best sushi I have had, hands down.

What can I say about this place, a sushi restaurant that plays rock music and serves whiskey. The sushi is absolutely amazing, this was my first time having deep fried battered sushi, amazingly the fish was still raw in the centre and melt in the mouth. Can't wait to go again.

Superb awesome and gastronomic sushi

We visited San Francisco twice and went to Ryoko a couple of times. We did a lot of sushi restaurants but this one is unbelievable. Good!!!! Everything is fantastic also the fact that you can't even reserve a table, they don't give a damn, people just wait an hour, you know why? Because it's the freshest tuna in the world and they've got many artistic combinations, go there and find out, we haven't ever tasted sushi this good and believe me, I've done over a hundred different sushi bars last year. Compliments for Ryoko!!!Rupert from Holland

I was traveling alone on business and was dying for some great sushi. Walked a few blocks and saw a big line out the door. I waited awhile and a nice server noticed I was alone and quickly seated me at the bar. The place is fast paced and loud but the staff were quite attentive to me. The sushi was good quality and beautiful. 

Fun and delicious!

We got there on Sunday night 5 min before they opened at 6 and there were about 30 people in line waiting to get in. Can't imagine what the wait would be on the weekend!! The line continued until we left. We sat at the bar and our waitress, Take, (sp?) was great, since we don't know much about sushi. Everything came very quickly; the food was so fresh and delicious. The music is very loud and we were entertained by the chefs behind the bar, who did not stop working for one second. Great place!

We had heard good things about this place so we decided to go for it. The wait was crazy long so we went to have drinks somewhere else after putting our name on the list. It is extremely crowded and a little overwhelming. It is also very loud, too loud really. The food was vert good but they don't give you many pieces when you order rolls, so be prepared for that.

Hey DJ! You gave me new SUSHI experience. Thank YOU!Guys - if you are a Sushi lover then you will love this place. Been here on a Monday evening with some customers at around 8pm. We saw the people almost waiting outside! Hmmmm. Really? Should we wait 30mins? Come on. Let's wait & get excited - we thought! ....and it was the right decision!Check for the daily specials! They are fresh and having this WOW effect. Let the waitress decide for you & will be impressed. At least I was and now I am writing about it :)Definitely worth waiting and eating here.The DJ we had is mixing really in a fin way his hip hop style. He doesn't give a f..k if it makes sense to mix these songs you might think but this is exactly the fun thing!I hope you will enjoy it...

Ryokos came recommended by a local San Fran resident for great Japanese - and it didn't disappoint.We waited for about 40min for a table (apparently this is the standard) you need to write your name down as you go in...But the wait was worth it.Great selection of sushi and sashimi, reasonably priced and the service was great - the wait for the food was not long even though they were so busy.After 9pm they have a house DJ playing which added a fun vibe to the place - it gets loud so you're lucky to get a table or booth up the back.Definitely would recommend you try this little gem for dinner when you're next in San Fran!

We've been there with two colleagues, looking for regular sushi. We did not reserve and have to wait about 1 hour (Saturday night !).This restaurant which is underground seems to be a trendy place for students and joungers. However, we had average good Sushi's and sashimis, noting crazy but fresh !I would recommend to spontaneous sushi party when staying near Union Square.

Don't understand the hipe about this place?The sushi was OK but that's it! I have tasted sushi many times better for less. Do not order their signature rolls, it's 3 times the price, 6 pieces for 26 dollars.

The DJ was amazing, so even if you're waiting on a table you can get yourself a drink and enjoy the atmosphere! The service is good, since its open late night its always crowded and the waiters may tend to take longer to check in on you.The food was great, I got Fried Cheese for appetizer and Jumping California Sushi. The sushi was crab and avocado deep fried served with their house special sweet and hot sauce. I will always want my sushi dipped in that sauce now, much better flavor than the typical soy sauce. Additionally, both were totally worth the price.

During our visit to San Francisco we went here because of all the good recommendations on Trip Advisor. We were longing for good sushi and this place was just around the corner from our hotel. We were definitely not disappointed! The place was fully packed but luckily we didn't have to wait more then 10 minutes. The service was quick and friendly and the sushi was very tasty. The prices are very reasonable, especially in comparison to some other restaurants in the city. Absolute recommendation to go here. The only thing we liked slightly less is the very loud music, but hey, you can't have everything!

I love all the rolls here. The food is simple and delicious. The restaurant also open very late so it's good choice for night meal. Normally you have to wait about 30 mins to have table. Music is a bit too loud sometimes.

We try sushi wherever we go, and have been to a lot of places. Had high hopes for this one, but incredibly disappointed. It was not very crowded, and we ordered a few very simple sushi rolls, nothing fancy. 70 minutes later it arrived. Very small, very skimpy with the fish, and the server never came back except to bring the check. Had to ask for water, got a 3-inch tall glass that was never refilled. The place is very loud, can't even talk across the table, and just very low quality sushi. Should be about half the price they charge.

Very poor service

We've ordered himachi roll and received himachi sashimi. The 2 small pieces of sashimi came out on the same plate as our Philadelphia roll and we thought that this was part of the dish.After telling the waiter about the missing himachi roll, he angrily dismissed us saying that this is exactly what we have ordered and we ate it! His tone and angry gestures were very unpleasant.So after waiting more than half an hour in line we ended up paying for something we did not want.

Just like other reviews stated, the place is overpriced and the food is so so. I ordered a first course with beef ($14-15) and it was alright. And then 9 pieces sushi + California rolls ($40): the salmon was not that great and the rest of other fish types were just average. If you want a fun place to hang out this might be for you but I would not suggest it in term of food quality.

Best sushi ever, tuna smooth succulent like butter, salad not your typical ginger dressing. Freshness exudes! Wait was about 20-30 minutes and worth every second. Not your typical atmosphere. Be sure to check in by writing your name down on the clipboard down the steps.

We went here at 11pm on a Monday, was still packed. Ordered the beef tataki which was fantastic, the other dishes including the sushi were so-so. Felt the service was quite poor, especially at the end when I asked for a receipt, the waitress said we don't give receipts to customers, I then asked but I would like one, she replied you can take a picture of it if you want, I told her no I would like a receipt, she walked away with a disgusted look on her face. Later I received the bill from what I assumed was the manager with guestcheck stamped on it which is what I assume they provide guests. This encouter really put a bad experience for me at this place so I will not be going there again.

As a tourist, we look for a place to eat at 11pm and this place show up on the list and its not far from where we stay, just give it a try.Located on a lower floor but the sign is easy to see since theres not so many restaurant open in that area. The area is safe and close to Union Square and a block away from the cable car. This Japanese sushi place is not big. Nice food thou and don't forget to mention about the service, Brilliant! The staff really helpful with menu also taking good care of customers even its very late.Sushi and roll were nice. The beef on starter list was very nice and tasty. Good!!

Great food. Very busy so expect to wait. The place has an interesting vibe with its lighting, music and ambience and yet serve the best Sushi in the Bay. Priced low so making it affordable. The only downside is the operational flow and service. They could do with a strong manager who can coordinate the service turn around and the speed of etc...there was either a lack of staff or nuclear roles of who does what. Nevertheless this aside a great place for Japanese food and a must visit..

This place is a little hole in the wall and we almost walked right by it. The atmosphere is cool with modern music and low lighting. Any time someone walks in, the staff shout. The prices were decent, the food was fantastic, the portions were somewhat small though. I had to have a small snack afterward.
