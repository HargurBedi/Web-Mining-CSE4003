This was a small place just outside of Fisherman's Wharf. Very small on the inside. I felt like I could easily join my neighbors conversation. The staff was friendly and attentive. It was the best breakfast food I had on my whole trip from Monterey to San Francisco. The omelette was great, the hash browns huge and a stack of toasted sourdough I couldn't get enough of. We will stop in again on our next trip

Visited here every day throughout my 5 days in San Francisco. The lines are lengthy, but certainly worth the wait. Great food , generous serves and really good service. Solid choice for a good breakfast, took around 45 mins to be in and out after the wait . But it's certainly worth it. Recommended

Oh my gosh, if you are hungry go here. They are one of the earliest to open as well. Food was great, 12-15 per plate, so it's a bit pricy. McDonald's would have cost the same for the same amount of food. We ate both breakfasts there.

It was my favorite breakfast place during our recent visit of SF. Line seemed to be long (it is a small place after all), but moved pretty fast and they bring you menus while you are waiting - so by the time we got in we were ready to order. Very friendly and efficient service, great food presentation. I ordered eggs Benedict which were perfect. Loved it!

We read about this place online and it didn't disappoint. In fact, it was so good that we went there twice for breakfast during our 3-day visit to San Francisco!It's worth noting that it's not the biggest of places so be prepared to stand in line - on both occasions we had to queue for approx. 20 minutes for a table, but it's well worth the wait. The choice of breakfast foods was incredible; eggs, omelettes, pancakes, sandwiches, burritos, wraps, french toasts, fresh fruit...all of which seem to be served with their signature hash browns (which are huge and to die for!) Portion sizes are extremely generous (seriously, the fruit bowl was big enough for two people!) and the waiting staff are so friendly and efficient. It's ideally located for those staying in or around Fisherman's Wharf and is just a short walk from most of the iconic tourist attractions in that area of the city.

We came here for breakfast 3 out of the 5 days we stayed in SF. There was always a queue but we didnt wait more than 15-20 mins and they give you a menu to read whilst you wait. The servings are generous and everything we tried was spot on. Even the coffee (latte) was good which is a big call from an Aussie! Will definitely be back here on our next trip!

We stopped here for breakfast after seeing good reviews on TripAdvisor. Had to queue for a little while but we were a party of 6 so not unexpected as it is quite small.The servers were good, the food was relatively quick and it was a huge portion of great food. It was a little pricey but it seemed more worth it than some places we saw.

There's usually a queue awaiting entry to the Hollywood Cafe, and with good reason. The food is fresh, tasty, attractively presented, and served in generous portions.

I recently ate at the Hollywood Cafe due to reading other TA reviews about it being so good. I will agree the food was good and was a nice change up from our morning hotel breakfast. I ordered a french toast combo (3 slices of french toast, eggs, and sausage patties) for $17. I guess that's an average price but I am not complaining because the food was good. I will inform you get there a few minutes before they open because the place fills up quickly. 

Once in awhile, I still think about the brilliance of this cafe.

I would gladly travel back to San Fran only for the sake of this cafe. This is a can't miss! Go here and you will not regret it.

We were within walking distance so tried the Hollywood Cafe. It also had been recommended. It was a fantastic breakfast. We didn't have to way for a table but there was a line shortly after we were seated. The Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly and the Hollandaise was great. The fruit that accompanies some breakfasts has to be seen to be believed. There were at least ten different types of fruit. All of our entrees were great. The Vivian Leigh is very good as was the French toast and hash burrito. The cafe is open for breakfast and lunch. Worth a visit.

Day 1 on a holiday/vacation in San Francisco, I checked out the places open for breakfast nearby, and we chose Hollywood Cafe. When we arrived there was a queue around the corner, and we thought oh crap we'll have to wait for ages or find somewhere else. Well we joined the queue which had about 25 people in front of us, and we're pleased to see the queue move reasonably quickly. A server asked us within a few minutes how many in the party and gave us a menu. We were seated outside within about 15 minutes. We all ordered different things from the menu, and were very pleased that it was served quickly, very fresh cooked properly and looking very good. It also tasted fantastic or even awesome !! We were not rushed, and the service was excellent. The queue of 25+ people never shortened while we were there :-) and having eaten there we could see why. For me this is a VERY HIGH recommendation for anyone looking for a place to eat breakfast, and I assume lunch is equally as good.

We didn't have too long a wait on a Wednesday morning for a table for 2. We agreed to first available, rather than pick inside or outside. Large menu with lots of options. Friendly service. We each ordered omelets. I ordered the Hollywood hashbrowns instead of the basic hashbrowns. This is where the timing in the kitchen became an issue. My boyfriend got his omelet with the accompanying toast for both of us. Almost 5 minutes later, I got my omelet. The hashbrowns on his plate were very cool to the touch. 5 minutes later, when my plate arrived, my hashbrowns, even with the additional toppings, were also lukewarm. There is some disconnect with the timing and plating of the potatoes with the rest of the plate items. The portions are quite large. The omelets were hot when served.The restroom is in another building, down a bit of a creepy hallway. You need a code to enter the bathroom, but not the creepy hallway.

There are huge portions, super fresh assortment of fruit, and I loved my omelet. All around, great spot.

We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Fisherman's Wharf, which was only about 3 blocks from the Hollywood Cafe. We checked TripAdvisor for nearby breakfast places and found this gem. We went there twice during our stay, both for breakfast. We didn't get there especially early, probably around 9 am. Had to wait each time about 20 minutes, but they are so friendly and organized, it was totally worth the wait. The food was wonderful and such nice fresh fruit. They actually have a person who prepares the presentation on your plate to satisfy the eye as well as the appetite. Would definitely go back there again.

My daughter found this with a google a stones throw from our hotel. Being early risers we walked straight in and got a table, we would have got there a little after 7am and we got one of the last tables.Service was excellent, even a little over the top at times, but I'd rather that than the opposite. I had the vegetarian omelette, as did my daughter, we both agreed it was just superb. All four of us were impressed not only by the food but the quality of service.We were probably in there for 40 mins, and coming out couldn't believe the line up, almost Disneyland type. Thankfully, from what we can gather American's enjoy a later breakfast than their Australian counterparts.Go there, go early and I can't for one minute believe you will be disappointed.

Around 15 minutes later there is a waiting line already and around 8 a.m. it does not really matter any more if you want to sit inside or outside...the place is crowded and you have to anticipate waiting for at least 15-30 minutes I guess.But it is worth the wait. The portions are huge, the quality and taste of the food is excellent. I can especially recommend all sorts of Egg Benedict they are selling.

The daily line to get a seat will let you know how good this place is. The staff all seemed to work very hard to give you a timely, quality meal. We had everything from an egg and cheese sandwich on sourdough, crab omelet with hash browns (served as a sheet of hash brown pretty interesting) to a pancakes, egg and sausage platter. All were excellent and very large. Breakfast came to about $60 with 2 drinks and 4 meals. For SF not bad and given the food excellent. The line goes fairly quickly and there is seating both inside and out.

The food here is really really good. We sat outside and enjoyed the cool morning of SF while we ate breakfast. Everything was very tasty. It takes a few minutes for the food to come out - maybe because it is a busy place and the kitchen cannot keep up but we waited several minutes longer than we'd have liked. I don't mind it if good food takes time but other place such as Crepevine are quick at delivering excellent food. So that was a bit frustrating.But go there anyway... prepare to wait a couple of minutes to be seated. They are busy. You won't be disappointed by the quality of the food. My crew was quite satisfied with the meal.

We arrived early so no wait but by the time we left there was a line. The servers here work hard and hustle to get everyone in and out quick to go enjoy the sights. There is no lingering here as they are trying to turn tables quickly which we were fine with. The fruit bowl is the nicest I have ever seen anywhere. Highly recommend this place for breakfast. We were staying at the Holiday Inn and it was a quick walk.

The food was wonderful, the service was great! What was really amazing is how busy they were and how they still managed to get our food out quickly and give us the best service! They also do lunch and I'm sure that would be equally as good!

Good &amp; Plenty

This is a homey little diner with pictures of by-gone stars on the walls. The food here is a decent, home-style breakfast. We had eggs, toast and hash browns which took up the whole plate. The hidden treasure is the mixed berry jam on the table: ours was fresh and tasty. Lines build up quickly, so try to get there as close to 7:00 as possible, especially if you want outdoor seating.

Great food

Stopped here for breakfast today while touring the city. The food was great and the service was excellent. The wait time was short, so overall a really good experience. Menu substitutions are a bit limited, so "crafting" your ideal breakfast isn't as likely as at some other places. That being said, a great experience and we would definitely visit here again!! 4.5 stars!

Scrumptious!!

Wait is a pain but worth it. If you can make it before 8, which we did once then you'll get seated almost right away. The menu is extensive, we visited three times as it was just across the road from our hotel. I had bacon omelette on day 1, which surprisingly was served with potatoes (we don't do potatoes in the morning in the UK) - it was utterly delicious. Fruit and yogurt on day 2, huge serving, fruit to die for and finally a super tasty pancake on day 3.It's a very efficient establishment, staff are totally on the ball, constant coffee refills and as much toast as you like. The only downside was the toilets, which were hard to find and in an adjacent building with a code to get in, and I have to say staff could have provided more clarity on how to get there. 

Amazing breakfast

We visited San Francisco in June and stayed at a nearby hotel. I had seen recommendations for the Hollywood Cafe on trip advisor and we decided to give it a go for breakfast. The food (we had pancakes with fresh fruit) was excellent and we went back every day during our stay. As previous reviewers have noted there is usually a queue to be seated outside so get there early.

Efficient service+good breakfast

As others have commented, it is worth waiting 10 min for this breakfast. We got the menues while waiting, so we could decide immediately what we wanted when we were seated. Wonderful fresh orange juice, and a good selection of healthy dishes. We arrived just before 9 and were seated after 10 minutes. When we left, the queue was a bit longer, so I do no know how long time the waiting time was then.

Yummy breakfast

Fast service, yummy breakfast. Be sure to get there early and then be prepared to move along with breakfast and have your plates taken at the first sign that you might be finished. Waiter whisked our toast plate away before I was even finished. It was a great breakfast though. 

Amazing Food!

There might be a line to get into this place but it's well worth the wait. The staff are very friendly and efficient. It will not take long to get in to eat and the food is fresh and delicious!

Only way to start the day!

This cafe was next to our hotel. We noticed the long breakfast line so decided to try it on the last day of our stay. Stood in line for about 20 minutes and it was worth it. Friendly staff, great food. It's small and quaint. Will definitely go back the next time we're in town. 

Good breakfast

The cafe was on the other side of our hotel. The served breakfast was good, the fruit was fresh. We have been one of the first in the morning and got a place inside, but every morning there were lots of people waiting to get a seat. That's why don't be late.

What a breakfast.

This place was right across the street from the Hyatt where we were staying. There was a small queue outside but that moved quite quickly.It was well worth the wait. Best breakfast we had in the whole of California. The meals are named after Hollywood actresses. The side they give you of fresh fruit Is enough for breakfast it's self. A must visit! 

Good food, moderate prices

You can usually tell when a restaurant offers good food at moderate prices - there's a line out the door. If you want a great breakfast much more reasonable the the nearby hotels get there by 7 a.m. To avoid the line and enjoy.
