Let me start off by saying this was my first Michelin 3-star experience, so my food expectations were very high. The prix fixe menu for $250 was beautifully presented. Each dish was creative, elegant and a wowed the eyes. Though every dish tasted really good, I wasn't wowed except for 4 of 12 dishes. Actually there were more than 12 dishes because we also tasted everything on the dessert cart. What impressed the most was the service which was OUTSTANDING and this made the experience most memorable.

Formal high end restaurant with a great vegetarian tasting menu
Rating: 4

This is a high end restaurant. They accommodate vegetarians well & also those who don't drink alcohol. We had their vegetarian tasting menu. The food was very good & creative, using unique items such as herbs & other ingredients. You have to leave 3 hours to dine here. Come here for a dining experience or special occasion. I am not giving it a 5 as the desert we got was not very good - essentially some chocolates, caramel & one other item - I would have expected a high end restaurant to prepare something such as a cake or mousse, for the price we paid of $250 per person, plus drinks, taxes, & tips. The Taj Campton Place still stands as my favorite high end place in San Francisco The 1st time we dined at Quince a few years ago one item came to us which was not vegetarian, but they more than made up for that error with the manager personally checking everything after & this time we did not have that problem. The 1st time we dined here, we were also shown the kitchen - very clean & organized.

We'd never tried a Michelin 3 star, so this was a must. The food was absolutely excellent and the service was stellar. My wife had the wine pairing, but next time we'd probably stay with a couple of preferred glasses. My only real critique is that at 160 pounds, I'm not a big guy, and I left hungry. The wrap up dessert tray (from which you can have as much as you'd like) wasn't too amazing. The bill was over 1050 for 2 with tip and I went to In & Out later, which was pretty funny and frustrating. I still haven't decided if it was worth it, but to their credit, it was delicious and the service was some of the best I've ever had.

One of the greatest 3* restaurant experience ever. The food is succulent and master the art of combination. The service is one of the best we ever had - special mention to Sebastian who had been such a pleasure to deal with. Very professional. The cherry on the top was the very exclusive visit of the kitchen where we had our last savoury dish in the actual kitchen and where chef Tusk explained us the ins and out of how it all worked! Wow that blowed us away! The dessert trolley is to die for... but wait for when you're about to leave and they provide you with a hot chocolate to take away! How is this!? A must restaurant to try when you visit SF next!

The chef is very creative, and the food was very good -- better than Saisons and Benu in my view. (The squab was the only dish I didn't like.) And the service was actually far and away some of the best we've had. But there was just too much food on the tasting menu, which is the only option. I was ready to leave well before the end of the meal. And it is very expensive.

We recently dinned in this high end restaurant and had an enjoyable evening. The interior is modern with dimmed lights. The food was very good, with few exceptional dishes (lamb dish). A big problem is the noise in the restaurant, we have never been to a 3 Michelin star restaurant that was so noisy! We also had to wait for about 10 min after we were seated to get someones attention and about 20-30 min in between each dish for the first 3 dishes, after that all the dishes came out very fast! Nonetheless, we enjoyed the dinner, but do not believe we'll come back soon. The hot chocolate before we left was a nice surprise!

What an amazing evening. A table for six for my wife's 70 birthday. The tab was on me.i could not ask for better place to celebrate her birthday. The dinner was four hours that which seemed Much shorter. . Fabulous food, great service. Beautiful room. My cost $3000. It was worth ever penny. Every dish was better then the next. At the beginning we were all very hungry at the end we could not eat a slice of the cake, we did of course. They have a very special wine selection and they should. We live in the wine country. I will not spend over $100 for wine you do not need to, trust me some of their wines are over $1000+ I like California wines why their very good.

There are restaurants that you go to where you wonder whether the Michelin inspector had smoked a joint, was best friends with the chef or been slipped a wad before awarding their rating. Others you realise have been awarded their stars on gimmicks or narratives or a one stand out dish. This restaurant is neither of the above. This restaurant deserves its stars for the series of divine, delicious dishes it serves, all of a consistently high standard. Don't get me wrong, these dishes aren't standard fare, they are inventive and exciting in the way they are served ......... I shall stop there for risk of spoiling it for you. For me, the particular highlights were the glass stacking dishes of black truffle served three different ways and the Garganelli with delicate Lobster. And how can I forget the freshly baked bread basket with olive, cheese and sour dough. So many restaurants seemed to have shunned this over recent years that it was impossible to decline the offer of seconds. This restaurant was by far one of the most enjoyable meals I had had in a long time. Service was slick and friendly and the bill was a pleasant surprise after eating in Saison the night before! This would be my first choice if place to eat in San Francisco.

Rather than repeat all the well deserved accolades for their incredible food, I wanted to focus on their service. Which was as incredible as their food. The service was not cookie cutter or rigid, it was perfectly applied to each persons dining experience. We were very interested in the wine selection and they made a point of taking us into their cellar. The service was smooth and fun and natural. There was not a stuffy or pretentious moment all night despite serving some of the most incredible food on the planet. I appreciated how in-tune the staff was with each diner and adjusted to them instead of expecing the other way around. Bravo to this amazing team of service staff and sommeliers. They are every bit the stars as the food and the chefs.

Entering the Quince restaurant on that windy San Francisco evening was like finding an exclusive refuge, where you were warmly welcomed and ushered to your seats. The atmosphere was elegant but rather dark, surrounded with exposed brick walls. I noticed that there was a careful sectioning of guests, which the layout of the restaurant allows for. Just as well, because we got a corner with only about 3 other tables along the wall.We had the Quince menu with 12 courses (13 for me, as I opted for the extra foie gras course). Almost all the dishes were perfectly executed, showing a variety of techniques that prevent you from getting bored. There were 2 pasta dishes, of which one of them (the Tortelli) was among my favorites of the evening (presentation-wise as well). The other top dish was the White Asparagus that had been cooked in a savory broth. Only the Abalone course was a bit of a let-down, because the meat felt rubbery. Save space for the final sweet closing, an array of mignardises that you can't turn your eyes away from. I guess one could argue whether the food is really a 3-Michelin star quality, or 2, or 2.5, but the whole experience definitely ranks up there. From the welcome to the farewell, we never felt unattended and the service was always polite and informative. The waitstaff definitely knows how to deal with different guests - families with children, couples, or tourists. Yes, it is expensive, but it's definitely worth the money.

This may have been the best meal of my life! There were two option- price fix summer $215 a person or the normal price fix menu at $250 a person. Everyone in your party needs to select the same options. This is exactly how fine dining should be everywhere- quality food and friendly staff. Even though they are serving top notch courses they do so with a friendly, casual demeanor. My favorite was the poached white asparagus and asparagus tea. I also loved the lamb course. Everything was beautiful and delicious! Thank you for a memorable night!

My husband and I have eaten at some of the best, most well rated restaurants in America (and several abroad) and I can safely assure anyone who enjoys this type of dining that Quince is a must go to.From the moment we walked in until we left (4 and a half hours later!) we were treated to a meal fit for royalty. But don't get me wrong- no one was pretentious. The service was attentive and elegant but very friendly. When each dish came out, it was explained in a knowledgeable and friendly manner. Everyone who worked there seemed to understand the intricacies of each dish . I am not going to get into detailed descriptions of the food here because from what I understand, the menu changes frequently based on seasonal items and just to keep the whole experience fresh . Suffice it so say, this is foodie paradise. Here are a couple of things that I must point out, however.The wine pairing is a MUST with this gastronomic feast. We do wine pairings almost every time we do a tasting menu and this was by far the best pairing we have ever had. Not only do they open OUTSTANDING and well respected older wines from great vintages but whoever does the actual pairing is extremely talented. They have a great cellar and they are not holding back.The attention to detail here is top of the line. Each physical plate is beautiful, let alone the food in it - and the same goes for the wine glasses. There must have been at least 8-10 different types of stemware used during our dinner and some of the pieces made you feel like you were dining in someone's house instead of in a restaurant. I can't say enough great things about this place.

We had fairly high expectations as this was a three-star restaurant. We have eaten at more than 15 Michelin starred restaurants around the world so we had pretty good reference points to benchmark Quince against. The service was friendly but a bit chaotic and unstructured. More training and coordination is needed, at least to qualify for 3 stars. The dishes went from mediocre to fantastic. The presentation was overall very nice for all the dishes, the tastes were sometimes bland and sometimes out of this world. The inconsistency and the chaotic service is more on par with a 1-star quaility. There were some final nice touches with the candy and hot chocolate while we are leaving. Still, considering that we spent 600 euros for two people, I had expected a bit more from Quince.

Quince gave us the best dining experience ever! Each course was perfectly plated and explained to us. Each course came with its own cutlery. We liked every course that came to us especially the fried toast with caviar. We were extremely full by the end and could barely down the hot chocolate they gave us as our take away for the night. The service was so excellent that when there was a small line (1 person inside and I was outside) at the bathroom I was escorted to another one just so I didn't have to wait for 30 seconds. Overall would definitely recommend it and go back! Worth every penny.

Visite Quince on July 4th with my wife and my 10-year-old daughter. Beautiful decor - looks like an redecorated old garage - and very gentil and really acknowledge personel! We went of the summer menu, a 5-course reduction of the house 8-douser menu. Liked the caviar on brioche toast with creme fraiche and hollandaise sauce, white asparagus is interesting but tasteless, garganeli with lobster is delicious and torteli with mushroom and parmesan is creative, but the "grand finale" did not show up: beef and desert were disappointing for a 3* Michelin restaurant. This was my first time at Quince. I left the restaurant with a feeling that I will eat better next time! I do want to come back next time in San Francisco.

We sampled the Summer menu which is the abbreviated version of the Quince menu, offering seven courses to the full twelve at a price, I recall, of $210 plus another $179 for the wine pairing.A 2004 Dom Perignon accompanied the caviar panna cotta, a pleasant white Jura the white asparagus simmered with lemon thyme, a Vorberg pinot bianco came with the lobster garganelli where some of the pasta was stuffed with the lobster tomalley (how they do this I cannot fathom), and the tortelli with porcini mushrooms and Australian black truffles was accompanied by a Marchesi di Barolo Barolo 1974.A lovely 1996 second growth, a Brane-Cantenac 1996 accompanied the small bites of lamb, while a Badia a Coltibuono Vin Santo del Chianti accompanied the strawberry meringue.Tiny bites, exquisitely prepared, like the tasting menus of yore. Excellently done, unctuous service. Worth a trip.

I was in town for a 3 days. I decided to go on a three star Michelin hunt, one a day. I took an interest in Quince because of a new star they have recently achieved. First off, the service was above and beyond. One of the best actually. The staff was very attentive and made us feel extremely comfortable. The food overall was great. As it was carefully thought out and quite inventive. The presentation is spectacular. However I found the taste in some courses were missing the wow factor. But that could be my personal preference, however the person who dined with me agrees. The dessert cart was to die for, especially the lemon tart.Another bonus; You also get a lovely hot chocolate on the way out.

The format is the now-standard multi-course tasting menu, except that instead of one or two bites, each course (of which there were 9 last night) is about the size of a standard restaurant appetizer. This means that by the time you get to the heavier latter courses, you are truly stuffed.The presentation and service are very slick, and the dining room is understated chic, darkly romantic. The staff strike a good balance between respectfulness and friendliness.To impress a date or be assured of cornering a business prospect for at least 3 hours, Quince would be a very good choice. As I was someone's guest and he brought his own wines, I don't know what the bill would come to for a typical patron, but this restaurant probably falls into the category of "if you have to ask, you can't afford it".Thanks to manager Matt Cirne, Chef de Cuisine Adrian Garcia, and headwaiter Juan Varedes for going out of their way to attend to us during the meal.

Do not go here if you plan to complain about price. It is by far the most Exquisite meal we have ever had. My wife and I are both chefs and we're extremely happy with the Quince Tasting Menu . Adam and Conan are the front of the house Stars. From the asparagus to the Dungeness crab it was perfect. I can't get into the many delicious things that we had. Just go and bring a thousand bucks. Nuff said. Impeccable is a good word. Be ready for a private room, intimate and lovely but may seem daunting. Enjoy the front of the house because they will take care of all of your needs. Go with an empty stomach and open up your taste buds. With 3 Michelin stars, it is exactly as advertised.

Quince is an experience as much as a meal. The multi course dinner of four hours or so is more than your average dining experience to begin with. They cater to your every need and try to make sure that your experience is amazing. The price might leave you a little light in the pocket, but overall it is unlike any other dining experience that you could have. The food can be exquisite to just ok. Obviously, that is subjective, but the service is absolutely excellent regardless. If you have an experience that is anything less, then something had to have gone wrong in the worst way. I mean, even leaving on a cold night, you're hand hot chocolate as you leave. What could be wrong with that?

Some dishes were (of course) very excellent, some dishes were just A-OK. The service was excellent. I don't think I need to harp on the food much, as people who are more "foodie" than me can provide their feedback. All I can say is, at this price range, food isn't going to taste bad. The only thing I want to point out in this review is that the portion size is way too big! You may think that this is a great thing, and who can complain about having too much food at $200+ per person. Well, it takes away the elegance and classiness of the restaurant, not to mention the discomfort of walking away feeling way too full. High-end restaurants with tasting menus should leave you full, but not stuffed; you should have the slight sensation of "wanting more." Not, "I'm not coming back for a LONG time." I've felt very full at other high-end restaurants, but Quince was over-the-top! Maybe they should have different portion sizes for people to choose from? They told me that the smaller menu serves the same amount of food, just less variety than the bigger menu. Anyway, this is the most uncomfortably stuffed I've ever felt at a restaurant of this caliber. Food was great/good, but nothing too special or unique.

At our recent dinner, we had flavors and ingredients that we have never tasted before, plus a few modern twists on old classics. The tasting menu is a chance to sample a plethora of chef Tusk's innovation and skill. Every course is memorable.

First walking in this place, it has almost an old School New York swanky feel about it. I really loved it. We had a business meeting with about 8 other people and had the tasting menu.Their menu changes frequently, with the seasons I imagine, and I just LOVED the pasta dishes. Each course was well thought out, and delicious. For non-adventurous eaters, I wouldn't recommend this place. Was this place as good as some other 3 Michelin star restaurants I've been to? No. But nevertheless, it was an experience, and we all enjoyed every dish, discussing what we thought about each one, and how different people perceived each dish based on their personal preference. I would come back and try it again. Their wines were heavenly with the meal. Definitely a good choice for a special occasion. Expect to be there awhile, and just really enjoy every dish that comes out. Service was great and really made the meal special, especially with such a big group of wine drinkers like ourselves!

We treated ourselves to an evening at Quince on our last night in the city. What a worthwhile experience! We were tucked away in an intimate corner of the restaurant and our waitstaff were phenomenal. The Quince menu was served over four hours with the courses were spaced perfectly for our appetites. Each dish was interesting and prominently featured either the restaurant's new garden or local producers. Impossible to pick a favorite, as everything tied together perfectly. The caviar, soup, lobster, and lamb courses stood out, and desserts of course. The service was top notch and we enjoyed our evening so much more for the knowledge and humor the staff brought to the table!

We had our anniversary dinner at Quince and it was one of the best Michelin Star experience we have ever had. We have been to French Laundry, Benu, Keiko and other Michelin Star Restaurants in the SF Bay Area ranging from 1-3 stars and even though the other restaurants were very good, Quince is our favorite.The ambiance was just right, the timing of the courses were spot on and the taste of the food was top notch. We had the wine pairing which was worth every penny and masterfully selected by the sommelier. The cost of the dinner including wine was about the same as other 3 Michelin star restaurants around $500 per person including tip and tax. If you have a special occasion, this is definitely worth the splurge! Thank you Quince for a wonderful evening and the great service!

This is my 5th 3-Michelin starred restaurant that I've been to while still trying to get a spot at "French Laundry" to complete all 6 of the 3-Michelin starred status restaurants in the Bay Area. My expectations were not up to par coming here after having dined only few months ago from "Manresa", and "The Restaurant at Meadowood" with disappointing outcome while "Joel Robuchon of Singapore" was simply divine.To start off, Quince impressed me right off the bat with the chef's compliment appetizers. From there, the anticipations of every dish heightened with excitements and drools. Every dish was beautiful and handcrafted with perfection, beauty and color. Once consumed, every bite was divine with such sublime high quality of food. I was in heaven to say the least! The staff were friendly and obliging. Service was impeccable to match its ambiance and the food. Every dish was amazingly flavorful but what I enjoyed the most was the presentation of every dish. Simply divine! The only negative thing I can mention was my foie gras was a bit overdone. Nonetheless, it was delish! I opted to order Osetra Caviar which was an $85 supplement per person while the foie was $40 per person. My husband settled for the local caviar which had no supplement fee and it was just as good as the Osetra. Quince is definitely my favorite Bay Area 3-Michelin star until "maybe" once I set my foot at "French Laundry" one day. I definitely would like to go back again one day and enjoy another slice of heaven...

We were warmly greeted, seated and never once rushed. Man, did we have a great, memorable evening. Some Oh Dukey! moments, with a hefty does of dazzle.Those smart folks at Quince have some fun going on, including moving pigs. No-one in our party had ever seen anything like it...in a restaurant. I won't take the fun out of it. Go experience it for yourself. We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu (surprise-always get the tasting menu, wallet permitting) and just sat back and let many chapters, written and performed by Quince & Co., dazzle and delight us.

Quince is another fine dining experience. For only $220, expect a 3+ hours of being wined and dined. Favorites included the black diamond truffles served on an iPad, which showed a video of pigs looking for truffles, the caviar with smoked sturgeon, Dungeness crab, and the Wagyu beef. I thought the abalone dish was just average because I barely tasted it and the two pasta dishes were interesting but just ok. They served two main desserts with a couple of smaller desserts afterwards. Nothing stood out among the desserts. Service was outstanding. I lost count on the number of wait staff they had serving everything to perfection. Nice touch as we were leaving the restaurant was a cup of hot chocolate to keep us warm. They'll even give you one of the oranges by the front door.

First time we felt like small kids coming home for Mama's cooking. Chef Michael Tusk was so eager to cook for us making sure we were extremely well fed in his restaurant. Cuisine focuses on Franco-Italian dishes using top quality products prepared in a simple way to bring out the best flavour in every dish. We arrived early and our service staff invited us to meet the chef and his team in the kitchen. Due to our dietary restriction, chef prepared for us a Sonoma roast duck (Liberty duck), quince mostarda, parsnip, black trumpet mushroom served so elegantly on a petrified wooden plate. When we left Quince, chef Tusk was at the doorstep and we were each offered a cup of hot chocolate for our journey back to the hotel in winter SF...that's so heart warming. This is not just a 3 Michelin starred restaurant....but one where we really felt so sincere and heart warming. Michelin Director Michael Ellis described Quince as "....fantastic product, very precise food and clarity in the flavours..." and I would add one more....impeccable service. The best meal we had in SF during our two weeks stay. Oh yes, this is the only 3-starred restaurant in town where you have perfectly ironed table cloth! +1

I made a special trip to visit Quince in November 2016 which is soon after they had just received their third Michelin star. The experience already begins at the valet service which is seamless and care free, just pull up, get out and that's all. Walk in and you are warmly greeted into a beautiful and elegant setting where your coat check will also be care free with no coat tags and such, they know which jacket is yours when you leave. The drink pairing was world class and they don't slight you on the pour, if you finish your drink to soon they will top you off to make sure you have enough for your next dish. Now for the food. Some dishes were at a different class than others and wowed me more but that is typical of any tasting menu, some will inspire you more than another. All in all Quince is well deserved of their three stars, congratulations and well done.

A beautiful setting wherein pretentiousness gives way to near arrogance. They have rules! As when two people dine together they must order the same number of courses and the pace of service shall be determined by the kitchen rather than the preference of the diners. In the end it is not about you, it is about them. They know how wonderful they are, just watch the smug looks as they condescend. Want to spend a thousand dollars on dinner? Eat twice at Danko or Boulevard and have a lot more fun.

Dining at Quince is a sublime experience. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, the attention to detail was exquisite. As one would expect, the quality of the food is exemplary - worth travelling from the UK from! We were also delighted that the service was warm and attentive without being obsequious. The best meal we've ever had.

We had a closing dinner at Quince in the private dining room. A nine course meal with four different wines. Each course was excellent, and two or three were beyond excellent. Very attentive staff, wonderful wine selection. For that special occasion, a definite restaurant to check out.

Indeed a Michelin three starred restaurant!

This was a Christmas present for myself and my husband. We were so excited to have an unforgettable culinary experience. Unfortunately it was underwhelming.To be fair, the ambience is lovely. The service is very good. Nothing stands out as exceptional. However at these prices and for these Michelin stars everything from start to finish should be heavenly. My husband and I both selected the prix fixe menu paired with wine. I did notify the restaurant weeks ahead of our reservation, that I have some exceptions. I don't eat red meat, but I do enjoy seafood. I received a sparse plate of mushrooms with my husband's Tortelli Squab tasting plate. Additionally the wines were not appropriately paired with my reformatted menu. I received the same 1980 Latour Cabernet with my Loup de Mer as my husband did with his venison. I also noticed that the pace of the food was coming out much more slowly for our table than for those who dined around us. The table next to us was half way through their dinner when we sat down. They left. A new table was seated a quarter of the way through our tasting and finished before we did. They too had the wine pairing and the same prix fixe.For what this restaurant is touted to be, Quince did not provide a lovely dining experience for my husband and I. This was a $900.00 meal. There is a serious disconnect between the kitchen, the food quality, and the pace. The attention to detail is lacking as well as imagination and creativity with the cuisine. I will not be back and would encourage potential patrons to look at other dining options such as Saison, Benu, and even Spruce.I would remind this establishment of the Pete Wells NYT review of Per Se last year, Daniel who went from 3* to 2*, or Le Cirque.......

Everything about Quince is stunning. The service, the food, the wine, the prices. Budget $500 per person, more if your taste in wine veers towards the higher end. They will cater to all food allergies. Make your limitations as few as possible as it may eliminate many more things than you had intended. Do not include foods you just don't like. If you don't like something, just don't eat it. Quince menu has 13 courses, plus about 5 unnamed courses. This is a symphony for your mouth. Everyone should try it atleast once.Budget 4 to 5 hours.

My husband and I had dinner at Quince for the first night of our annual SF culinary weekend a few weeks ago. We very much enjoyed our dinner, though we don't quite thin Quince on this occasion measured up to its new 3 stars. Service was stellar. The young team handled everything with aplomb, while always being warm and friendly. The wine pairings were also stellar--perfectly pairing with each course. A very impressive performance in that department!The food was great...but only one course really wowed us in terms of flavor. The squab course was incredible, with tremendous flavors that really blew us away. The extra price caviar course was outstanding. But other courses were just very good and not particularly novel or mind-blowing. We ordered the extra caviar course for me, as well as an additional truffle course for me. The whole bill came to $1400 for the 2 of us. Considering that bill, we were left wanting a little more--while still believing this to be an outstanding restaurant. Just closer to 2 stars for us, rather than the newly celebrated 3 stars. Considering we had just dined at 3 star Le Calandre in Rubano (Italy), 2 star Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia in Milan, and 2 star The Ledbury (London) a few months ago, not to mention 3 star Manresa not 6 weeks ago, plus 2 star Campton place and 1 star Mourad the next 2 evenings of our culinary weekend, we feel Quince was more of a 2 star experience. We had also dined the year before at Benu and Atelier Crenn, and the year prior at Saison and Coi, so we think we offer good perspective.We very much enjoyed our meal at Quince. We just think it left us a bit wanting to deserve that 3rd star.

Okay, this place is expensive. I found it hard to give it 5 stars due to the price. But you pay for the superb service and the beautifully prepared dishes. Overall it was a wonderful once in a lifetime experience for us. The staff is very attentive but not pushy. The food was great. Some menu items were amazing (the lobster soup and the venison), for others I didn't get they hype (the mignardises were dry). Very glad we went, but I doubt I would go back.

I don't typically lead with a negative, but since there is only one with regards to this restaurant, I thought I might lead with it. This restaurant is expensive, and I imagine the white truffle menu that I believe was one of the best meals of my life was also one of the most expensive meals of my life. The meal was worth every penny. Honestly,(don't tell anyone) I would've paid more as the food and service were just that extraordinary. The restaurant brings creativity (a course was served on an iPad- NO, I'm not joking), artistry (the tweezers they use for plating are finer than the ones I use on my eyebrows- which either speaks to the beauty of their food or the one step away from unibrow I am), deliciousness (white truffles freshly shaved table side on every course) and service (a more refined and subtly humored staff could not be found) to a new level. 3 Michelins don't lie- the food and service is off the hook. Thank you John (sommelier extraordinaire) and Chef Chris for a beautiful kitchen tour. We will be back!

We tramped through Chinatown to the financial district, one area leading into another like colourful scene changes, as we looked for Quince restaurant. Every time we asked for directions, people looked envious and raved about it. We realised why immediately. Quince envelops you with its artistic, calming chandelier, vases of exquisite owers, dark sophisticated colours. Here every detail is perfect. As restaurants get brighter, louder and more crowded, Quince gives you space, comfort and the exceptional. The fish is so intensely fresh, vegetables so creamy and sweet and the wine pairing exciting. Manager Matt Circe brings a real charm, huge experience and tremendous warmth to this spectacular place

I called Quince to see if they could squeeze me in the same day, and while I was not able to get in for the tasting menu, they were able to seat me in "The Salon". I am SO glad I went!!! The food was outstanding from the amuse bouches to the Hot Chocolate they gave me on the way out the door! The lobster omelette was awesome, delicate and flavorful, packed with lobster and sweet caviar on top. The Truffle Risotto with freshly shaved truffles on top was unbelievable, just the aroma was enough to make me smile! My waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the sommelier helped me out with some information on where to go to get wines to bring home. All in all a truly remarkable evening.

Looked at reviews and went with this one as didn't want 3 star but wanted discuss occasion that was easy to get to when staying in SF for a conference. Very welcoming staff, great service, nice ambiance and would recommend. The food was great, being generous with expensive ingredients such as caviar (beluga was supplement cost) and lobster. The matching wine was delicious, although quite stingy portions (am use to European/ British sized pours!) I did say I liked the last red, and got a top up, which was great! I bought two bottles of the last red at the airport on the way home.....it really was that good! Personal food highlight was ravioli with ragu filling. The extras such as the bread and the petit fours were great. These extras can make the difference to the whole night and so it's great to see Quince has now got 3 stars. It's relaxed enough to enjoy without feeling too stuffy. But the bill would make this a special occasion place, rather than routine (unless you've made your millions in SF area).

Went to Quince last night for a dinner with the Mrs. We have been to this restaurant before a few years ago and were surprised how its changed. It use to have a regular menu where you could choose from four or five starters , entrees , deserts, etc. but we encountered a price fixed menu of only what they serve for the night, no choices. Our fault for not checking and they were very helpful in that if you could not eat something , dietary, gluten , and so forth they would alter the dish to your liking , which was nice. The courses were well prepared , inventive but on the small side. For 220 dollars per person you probably ate about 50 dollars of food. The staff was attentive but on the yuppie -puppy side and seemed bothered by your questions . It seemed to us that they wanted to copy Per Se, French Laundry, etc but were worlds apart. The meal took 3 to four hours which was nice in the romantic part but not so in the starving part. We had a bottle of wine with us that lasted five courses 2 hours and brought another one . The wine list is ample but extremely over priced for San Francisco. There are much better restaurants in SF especially for the price. Their sister restaurant next door has a menu to pick from, better food and you do not have to take out a bank loan to pay for dinner.

We enjoyed an extremely memorable 3 hour dining experience this week at Quince. The food, presentation, service and ambience is spot on and designed to stimulate all the right senses. The food is incredibly flavorful with ingredients sources from their own farms or locally, the dishes are handpicked from around the world and to cap it off the service is orchestrated like a symphony to go off without a hitch with perfect spacing between courses. Highly, highly recommend for a special occasion or simply to enjoy a blissful meal!

There is a reason that Quince has maintained it's 2 Michelin Stars for so many years...and that reason is because everything they do is amazing! The restaurant itself is beautiful and welcoming, with a spectacular art collection. The staff is attentive and courteous. And the food...is simply phenomenal. Obviously a $250+ per person multi course meal isn't something that you are going to do every day. But on the day that you do it, you will be rewarded with an experience of a lifetime. The food is creative and delicious! From the humble potato (the best I've ever had), to the dish that was supposed to remind you of crashing into a wave while surfing, to the jewel like desserts, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was absolutely flawless. I can't wait to go again someday. ;)

We stopped in on the third hop of a dinner/snack crawl, expecting to sit at the bar.....but the bar is gone. They did sit us in the small lounge area, and the fun began. We split four dishes amoung 3 of us, then desert. add in amuse b, desert amuse b, petite fours, and hot chocolate on the way out, and it was an amazing meal. The service was impeccable, adapting to our informal lounge seating arrangement. Wine and sommelier were equally impressive. Not for the faint of heart on the price points, but well worth it.

This is the place to go to celebrate a special birthday, with a menu bearing your name. Always superb and unforgettable service in one of the last quiet restaurants in San Francisco as well as exceptional fine dining. The decor is subtly iconic and lovely. Tables spaced just so that your conversation stats only at your table and vice versa. Rare again in SF, where more and more tables crammed together means more money. Sad. But lucky for us we can manage a couple of dinners a year at Quince to feel like we are very special. Thank you for never disappointing us.

Service: 5 stars, impeccable, observant and discreet Ambiance: 5 stars, elegant, muted, we could converse in civilized tones, pacing lovelyMenu: 4.5 stars , overall delicious, at times overly rich, too many pasta based courses, a bit weak at times regarding visual/edible art, at times dishes were overly complicated losing the essence of their delicate and stellar ingredients Examples: Hmmm: A "Miss"-Caviar; decent portion, the accompanying brioche was delicious in it's butteriness but it overpowered the subtle local caviar , the avocado soup pairing although interesting was just okay. The subtle caviar would've been better served nestled within delicate buckwheat / savory mini crepes and celebrated with a more traditional simplicity. -Abalone; the delicate treasure was rather lost in the complexity of its surroundings-Mulberry "soup;" did not like it at all, tasted rather bitter, medicinal, lacking in flavor, vanilla/ scent was not a good complement , tapioca pearls gave the concoction a strange mouth feel. A definite miss. The actual berry was flavorful and the cookie like savory strip tastyWow: Lovely essence of flavor-The "oyster" leaf was a delicious surprise, bravo. Perhaps pair it with the small perfection of an actual single, tiny oyster captured within a briny jewel of a gelatinous pearl? -Loved the inventive and tasty "earthy" potatoes, fun-The corn pasta tortoloni was excellent, delicious essence of corn with fresh niblets and sauce, bravo-Pork loin , juicy perfection laid on a delicate pop of flavorful reduction sauce-Desserts: Iime creation, lovely essence, round puff pastry filled with coffee?/ vanilla custard; wild strawberries tartlet, triple yums Overall commentary: a number of dishes verged on being overly complex losing the essence of their high quality but subtle prime ingredients. Focus more on simplicity and heightening the essence of your flavor celebration instead of overly complicating them. Pump up on the visual food art aspect itself, be more creative in serving edible art, less on serving platters although inventive and lovely. Give me more visual art and flavor jewels that blow my mind and tastebuds... Less taste noise and more music essence. Overall, a lovely celebratory evening...

The Quince staff was friendly and welcoming - our server Conan was a gracious host who was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, the food preparation, and the history and evolution of the restaurant. Our meal was well-paced and, even though Quince was quite busy, our table was in a quiet area that allowed us to pleasantly converse and savor each course. Definitely a 5-star experience!

My last visit to Quince was roughly 6 years ago, in their old location. The new Quince is certainly more grown up; the old Quince was immensely competent but the new Quince is all that, plus bold and exciting in a welcoming manner.Their pasta dishes are of course their forte. The squid ink pasta with geoduck, squid and melon alone is worth a return trip. Sweet corn tortelini was mind blowing. Lobster and courgette flower with the most delicate hollandaise was to die for.A return trip is a must. Go eat here now!

I didn't find this place to be balanced in terms of quality to value. I felt a little gouged, mostly because of the ingredients: the Australian truffles were slightly reminiscent of the the ones from Italy, bland and not flavorful. Portions were adequate and presentation was commendable. The real highlight was the caviar dish, playfully presented, delightful and delicate. The rest was hit and miss. The 'intermezzo' potatoes... should be skipped. Sentimental value of the latter doesn't fit into an expensive meal frame. The most annoying aspect was an overpriced wine list. We are in California, people. Please find some wines that are reasonably priced from the region, rather than imported ones. I am sure it will not sacrifice the taste of the potatoes! Positives: the service was great and hot chocolate 'to go' was a nice touch, although we could have done without it for sure. I wish we went for the salon menu, to try it out first.

Greeted with good service waiter and is a TOP notch ! We changed our tables twice and he was so helpful to Ensure we were happy.. Well done. Except for one waitress who didn't know enough of the food and service level a bit not too attentive. Few occasions our wine glass were dried out and took me to wave my hand so to fill up my glass. Food were good but not too many surprises with the Michelin rated cuisine. Squid ink noodle, caviar, truffle egg , oyster grown vegetable , dessert, pork loin should worth a try . The open kitchen can be viewed from outside is unique! No surprise of the food creation but worth a try if you haven't been there.

This restaurant was by far the most expensive out of the all the restaurants me and my family have been to.My brother (23) and sister (24) visited this place in San Francisco just early 2016. My sister likes to eat at fancy restaurants so we booked a 30 meal dinner (30 very small dishes just enough to make you full by the 30th one)CUSTOMER SERVICE 2/5: The customer service was great but there was one worker that keeps eyeing us like we were crazy or something even though we were dressed nicely and didn't act suspicious at all. I'd rate it 2/5 because I felt very uncomfortable and judged for some reasonRESTAURANT SERVICE 4/5: For a fancy restaurant the food was pretty cool, some had smoke inside it so when you take off the lid it world go everywhere and looked really cool. I'd rate it 4/5 because it was pretty delicious and presented very nicely.PRICE 0/5: I know it seems unbelievable but it cost $1000 and something, we were shocked to see this, although we did pay it as we used my dads points on his bank account (overtime you earn points which you can use for hotels, restaurants etc instead of paying)for the trip and had quite a lot of money to pay for the dinner.NOTE: This is a very expensive restaurant and is very elegant and fancy. Do not go here expecting to have an average prices dinner. Also it is a very oddly dark restaurant!!!

When you feel flush and want a 2-3 star Michelin experience, dine at Quince. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff might just be the best trained in San Francisco. This is a restaurant with an attentive, but unobtrusive staff. Pacing of the multi-course meal is perfect and the imagination in the kitchen is quite impressive, as is the performance. The night we were there Michael Tuck was not present, but it didn't make any difference in the quality of the food--for me, the mark of a great restaurant.The fare is listed in the menu as about 11 courses, but I think several more were inserted during our 3 1/2 hour meal. Mid way through we were invited into the kitchen where olive shaped, gin and tonic liquid nitrogen frozen balls were made and we were encouraged to pop them in our mouths are refreshment. Commander Whitehead never had it so good!Originally a pasta themed and conscious restaurant, this is now more main stream avante garde, yet agnolotti appear as did a bonus freshly made squid ink pasta with seafood. Top course one evening was a doughnut ring shaped brioche toppled with caviar and served with a richly reduced creamy soup. Calories do mount up, so pace yourself.

Sometimes a restaurant might try to seat me at a table in less than a prime location--not Quince. I was seated at a lovely table, and the staff treated me like royalty throughout the dinner (extra courses; kitchen tour; even sent me home with a cup of the delicious blood orange tea that I enjoyed so much). When I return to San Francisco, I definitely will return to Quince!

Service is excellent, polite and friendly but not too familiar. One gets the tour of the kitchen and a chat with the chef after the meal, very interesting experience.Oh, yes, the food, the twelve course tasting menu is about right, not too much food, light and appetizing, and if there is anything on the menu one does not like, it can be switched to something else. All in all a very enjoyable outing.

This is an extremely expensive restaurant with a very creative chef. My husband and I were there to celebrate my milestone birthday. It is a restaurant for foodies who are not looking for quantity. If you are the type of person who likes a lot of food on their plate you will not enjoy eating here. This is most certainly the teensy fairy portion on a large plate kind of place. This does not annoy me, given that so many plates keep arriving, but you have been warned. We arrived flustered as a pothole in SF had just shredded one of the tires of our car. The servers were flawless the entire time. Just amazing perfect service like you would hope to find at this type of restaurant. They sat us in a back room which was nice and quiet. Our neighbors at the next table were three elegant Japanese women who kept their conversation at a normal level. There is nothing worse than getting seated next to loud people.The prix fixe menus were personalized and had my name and happy birthday on top. Very sweet. My husband had called in advance to tell them about my food allergies and they did their best to accommodate me (the chef I met has a girlfriend who is also gluten free). I appreciated this and the lack of an attitude when I ordered my lamb well done.  We ordered cocktails. My husband was pleased with his Old Fashioned. I had some kind of rum cocktail that I did not enjoy as it had pieces of hard tea in it. I love creativity but this one did not work for me. I later had a martini that was fine. The plates arrived (all distinct and some with distinct cool Japanese silverware) and they were creative little bursts of flavor presented with flowers etc. Some of what we ate: the caviar was very good (I had it plain and with cooked leaks. My husband had his with a brioche. I think they should come up with a gluten and dairy free buckwheat crepe for those of us who need an alternative), the white asparagus with peas and mushrooms was lovely, the lamb was delicious and cooked the way I like it and the risotto with mushrooms was very good. My husband had some different items like the breads with buffalo milk butter (it would be nice if they had some up with vegan home made rolls for me), oyster and he really liked the black cod and the farm eggs with truffle. I didn't eat the egg because it arrived in an egg shell and I didn't like the possibility of raw egg issues. We had squab on the menu which I didn't get served so perhaps the risotto was a substitute. One of the servers took as back to the kitchen to view the many chefs working. I liked that very much. I am one of those people who watches Master Chef and enjoys the kitchen magic. I thanked the chef for dealing with my food allergies.The weakest part of the meal were the desserts. The rhubarb was nice but I would have like more than the taste on the plate. The sorbets were bland. The cart with the many desserts at the end did not have much of a selection for gluten and dairy free people. The pistachios were nice. My husband enjoyed his selections from the cart and was also given a few to take home. I got a scoop of chocolate ice cream/sorbet with a candle for my birthday. While that was nice it was not impressive. I would have been happier with a tiny rum filled gluten free chocolate cake (they had this on the cart in gluten form). I have been more royally spoiled with dessert in other fine dining restaurants. The only blip in service is that the server took the signed check before we left the table. This is a pet peeve of mine. I think they should wait until the guests have left. He made up for it my offering my husband hot chocolate and me chamomile tea in to go cups as we left. While I would have preferred hot chocolate too (with soy milk)-- it was the thought that counted as I have never been offered a hot drink to go.Overall it was a lovely way to spend a birthday and I thank Quince for the happy memory.

Perfect experience

I had never been to a Michelin rated restaurant (to my knowledge) and wanted to give one a try. The 14 course menu was fantastic. I called ahead and verified that they had a vegetarian menu. The portions of may seem small, but after so many delicious (yes, each and every one was delicious) plates I was really full. The fixed price menu is expensive and there's no getting around that, but I guarantee you'll have a truly unique experience with excellent service. I also went ahead and did the wine pairing and their selections were great. Touching again on service, you truly feel special throughout the dinner. I was even offered a tour of the restaurant and kitchen towards the end of my meal and that was unexpected, but really cool.If you're wanting to celebrate a special occasion, looking for a nice romantic place, or just want to try something new like me, Quince would be an incredible choice!
