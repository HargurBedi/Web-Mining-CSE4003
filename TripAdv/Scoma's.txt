We dined in Scoma's on an overnight stay near Fisherman's Wharf. There's no doubting the history and character of the place but we were disappointed by the overall dining experience not least because of the attitude of our rather supercilious Breton server. Initially, he was all smarm & charm but, half way through the meal, he lost interest in us and turned his attention to other diners. Could it be that we weren't the big spenders that he had hoped for?

Scoma's is like many others in the Fisherman Wharf area but it has been serving up great grub for longer than others. Great pasta, great seafood, great views at sunset. This is a place to hit if you want a memorable meal in the touristy Fishermans wharf area.

I always try to work in a trip to Scoma when time allows during trips to San Fran. Food is good quality, portions are good, service is accommodating, prices are reasonable, atmosphere is fun and unique. Try the cioppino as it is one of the best in the city.

Had dinner and arrived early. Went to the bar and understood San Francisco higher pricing on drinks/food. They poured a fair drink for the money considering the bay area. At dinner, our server was professional and pleasant. Our meals were excellent. Really great flavors and perfectly done. We felt the meal was well worth the price. I would recommend to anyone who is not on a tight budget ( higher mid range prices) to enjoy the atmosphere and a terrific meal.

We loved our dinner at Scoma's -- the food was excellent and the location is great, just far enough off the main drag of Fisherman's Wharf that you have to know about it to get there. I love the atmosphere of the place, with multiple bars, wood tones and mostly booth style seating - a trip back to the 70's but in a good way.

You walk down a dark alley along the water front that leads to a harbor area. You see lights in a one-story building ahead and you come around the corner and see the bar. Unless you come early for dinner (or have reservations), expect a waiting list so you have a drink at the bar. Once you are seated, you know why you came. The service is terrific and the food is excellent. The portions are perfect and the taste is fresh. We will be back.

This restaurant has been there for a long time and has a big reputation. It's on the wharf, so you have to walk down from the road a little, or if you're driving they have valet parking on the wharf. We didn't have a booking so had to wait for about 1/2 hour for a table. Once seated inside, service is great. They have a LOT of people working there and the turnaround for tables is fast. The food was good, we both enjoyed our meals. It was fairly expensive though, so somewhere to go for a special occasion, not for every week. This was our first night in San Franscisco though, so qualified as a special occasion :)

On a girls weekend trip and was recommended Scoma's from a few cab drivers. Service was great but the food was very disappointing.Two of my friends ordered the scallops which were undercooked with this rice that had no flavour.One friend ordered the salmon which she says tasted like it was frozen and I had the mussels which was lukewarm at the most and in a tomato sauce not marinara.The bill was $200! Which is fine if the food was good.....I feel that the restaurant is riding on reputation of being in the neighbourhood the longest. There are many other great restaurants in little Italy that you would get way better food.On a side note the coffee was fresh and hot!

Back in the 60's I used to visit Al Scoma's restaurant behind the wharf for a bowl of his Mom's cioppino after a fishing trip. It was the standard I have rated every Italian fish stew since (throughout the Country and abroad). I came back after 42 years to discover that the Cioppino was as great as ever and the restaurant hadn't changed since 1965! So many things in the City have and this place hasn't thank God. It was a homecoming. Unfortunately the old Monterrey Clipper I fished on and docked in a slip across from Al's (Scoma's) place is long gone but the memories of being in this here are fond. Want a taste of old San Francisco? Go to Scoma's.

My wife's first trip any where and we found out she has severe motion sickness. We arrived at Scoma's and the waitress (Chia) stop everything she was doing to ensure my wife was back on track before serving us. She gave her a sprite and when this did not work she had the bartender to create a drink with bitters, which seemed to do the trick. It help put our first night in San Francisco back on track and created a memory we would never forget. Oh did I mention the food was exceptional!!!! Thanks to Chia and Scoma's my wife will never forget her trip.

Our last night in San Francisco we chose Scoma's.My husband found it while trying to see if he could get a night photo of the Golden Gate Bridge. He read the menu and came back and said this is where he would like to have dinner the next day. On our trip to Muir Woods the next day, Willis, our driver recomended Scoma's to all the guests. So on our last night in this beautiful city we came here. So glad we did. This past wednesday around 7:30 pm we came here for dinner and drinks. The lobster bisque, Dungeness crab cocktail and cioppini were very good. Also the spinach salad and truffle parmesan fries are very good side dishes. Had the drink pictured here that was very good. Not sure of proper name, but it was a margarita with hibiscus in it. Tasty! Our whole meal was very good. We did have to wait, but not more than 15 minutes or so. We did not have reservations. It is expensive but was priced accordingly with all other Wharf restaurants.

Scomas is a bit of a hidden restaurant which we found by chance.We picked a busy time to arrive around 6.30pm on a Saturday and so our table waiting time was 1 hour.We had some drinks and nibbles at the bar, served by a brilliant bar tender. She had a great knowledge of gins and wines. The restaurant had a waiting area near the bar so it fills up very quick to the point of being a little overcrowded.After an hour we got called for our table and had eaten and drank quite a bit by then. The food I ordered was not great but that was just my experience, however my friend did say the same.We felt a little rushed also which is never a comfortable feeling although the waitress was maybe not conscious of this.Overall the setting is Nice, lovely bar and service but food unfortunately wasn't great.

Cooked well, but nothing special.Service is mediocre and our waitress was a bit curt.Decor is horribly dated with extremely uncomfortable chairs. No view at all, even though it's on the water. Very expensive for the quality.There are much better seafood restaurants in SF. This one just happens to be famous. If you are on the wharf and looking to have lunch or dinner, this may be one of your better options. However, if you are willing to wander a bit away from the wharf, there are much better meals to be had.

After two sad days sightseeing in a declining city (trash, crime, homeless uncared for everywhere), it was a nice relief to end up on a wharf by the water, with fishing boats tied up right outside the restaurant, serving fresh seafood. It wasn't the best ever, but the clams, mussels, fish stew in tomato broth was excellent, the service very good, and overall a very nice dinner. It almost felt like being in New England, for just a little while.

Scoma's reminds me a bit of some older seafood places that existed in Galveston and Kemah, Texas before hurricanes forced a revamp. I didn't like where we were seated- we actually got there early and dressed very nicely, so I was hoping for a Bay view- not the canal. But, you get what you get. Since halibut is in season, we both ordered that along with a cup of lobster bisque which was ambrosia. Halibut was very tasty. Waiter was dispassionately polite and efficient... our food was good. Ambience lacking. Definitely geared towards tourist traffic now unfortunately. Get 'em in and out. When we left, there were a lot of tables empty... 7ish on a Friday night.

And finally with those older 'Italian style' waiters our expectations hit the roof.The place was very busy. But food came quick. We killed the time talking and eating bread. Wild Salmon was great, but fish in tomato sauce as local speciality was disappointing. All fresh, but every bite was ... Tomato flavor only.We finished with Tiramisu, but were wondering why the base layer was not soaked in coffee and liquor, as you get in Italy.Not bad, not great. We paid almost 150 dollars including tip. That's a lot.

Our daughter ordered the Lazy Man's Cioppino and it was a nice large portion of a variety of seafood. My husband is a fish and chips fan and the fish was fresh but the breading was soft, not crispy.

Had excellent sand dabs, and my wife liked her cioppino. The service felt a bit rushed, but overall a very nice experience.

We came here for lunch and were told that there would be a half hour to forty-five minute wait. We took the opportunity to walk around the wharf and have overpriced shrimp and crab cocktails from a stand at the nearby Alioto's. They were worth the cost. As it was, we were summoned back to Scoma's on our smart phone with a text after barely finishing our appetizers. We shared a large bowl of clam chowder and a delicious petrale dore. Already full, we made room for the excellent steamed Manila clams. This was the best meal we had in San Francisco.

I booked Scoma's in advance for our visit to San Francisco, having heard it was the place to go to... Sunday evening, arrived and shown to table and waited upon.Something wasn't quite right, the waiter was efficient and brisk, however no effort to smile or be friendly in the slightest. Food was very nicely cooked and was tasty, and this compensated towards the disappointing experience that was unfolding. Also, I visited the gents between courses and was quite shocked at the mess they were in! The bins were full and overflowing with discarded paper hand towels strewn all over the floor, etc. If the restaurant doesn't care to keep the client restrooms in a presentable order, what else is happening behind the scenes?We experienced better places to eat during our stay in San Francisco.

There were 6 of us for dinner. We had reservations but got there early and were able to be seated about 30 min early. A couple had the clam chowder which was really good. Nice and creamy but not too rich. My husband had the sole which he raved about for several days ( it was delicious I tried it). Another had the halibut which he thought was somewhat bland but was good and very fresh. I wasn't very hungry so had the heirloom tomato salad and it was yummy. It has a neat atmosphere but is usually crowded because of its location at the wharf so reservations recommended. Our server was an older French guy who was knowledgeable about the menu and provided good service. Would recommend.

An enjoyable and quaint place located right on the pier. Helpful and unassuming waiters and waitresses. They even made an exception and let us get some takeout on our last night in SF (as we ate there multiple times). Busy but not loud which is nice. 

Appetizers were just delicious.

It's a must go in SF. I really liked the location and also the service. We were a group of 21 people and the service was quick.

An excellent restaurant for seafood. Located on the legendary Fishermans Wharf, totally a wonderful experience. The restaurant has displays of celebrities that have visited the establishment. Fresh seafood and excellent service makes this place a must visit.

Not Quite As Good as Years Past

While the service remains impeccable, a few of the go to items on the menu have not remained at the pinnacle of perfection. Our sardine appetizer was definitely a hit and the fish dishes were way above average. However, the cioppino was disappointing as it tasted more like it was based upon watered down ketchup and had not a whiff of herbs or seasonings. The clam chowder was also proclaimed mediocre at best by our friends.We were fortunate enough to be seated by a window and the harbor side views were interesting but not spectacular.

Good experience

We took a walk from the Fisherman's Wharf to Scomas at the recommendation of our tour operator. It's in a sketchy looking, run down corner of the waterfront with boats that look like they may have been unused since the 1960's. But it just adds to the charm. We sat at the bar while we waited for our table and had a couple of cocktails. Our server was prompt and friendly. The meal was good, not amazing, but definitely pleasing. I would say if you have limited time there are many culinary options on SF to choose from but if you're in the area it's a solid place to eat,

A gem of a place, tucked away on Pier 47 San Francisco

Scoma's was recommended to us by a number of locals, and we were very happy with our meal and the service.The restaurant is located on Pier 47, but is not prominently signposted or visible from the main road. Only those intending to visit the venue, or those inquisitive enough to investigate when they see a distant Scoma's sign from the road, will find this place.Its a large restaurant, well appointed on the inside, and extremely busy 7pm on the evening we arrived. We didn't have a booking, but the wait was short and we had a drink in the bar area until a table came free. The seafood was amazing, as you would expect with most fish sustainably sourced and fresh off the boats. The staff were attentive and whilst not a cheap place to eat, we felt it was great value for money. A lovely seafood experience during our first trip to San Francisco.

While in SF, our group made a special, return trip to Scoma's.If you have never been here, do not be surprised when you learn that Al Scoma Way is more of an alley. The building looks worn, but the food is outstanding.It is a seafood restaurant with an Italian twist. Our group each ordered different items -all received rave reviews. The service was outstanding despite the size of the group.

Scoma's is one of the oldest Seafood restaurant by the water front in San Francisco. I heard great reviews and wanted to celebrate my birthday with my family. The location is walking distance to Ghirardelli Square and Pier 39. Because of its popularity with local Bay Area residence, we made reservations. We got there on time but we still had to wait for 20 mins standing on the side of the all. We ordered the Dungeness Crab Thermidor alla Scoma, 9 oz Wagyu Bistro Filet, Linguini con Vongole, and Pacific Black Cod. The dishes were good but not spectacular. It tasted like eating at a chain restaurant. It was overall a good experience but not a place I would come back to. The Dungeness Crab did not even taste fresh. I expected Michelin star dishes but got chain restaurant flavored dishes. If you want the experience of eating at one of the oldest seafood restaurants in San Francisco, it's worth trying out. If you are looking for fresh great food, Scoma's is not the place.

Sooooo Good

CiCi handles the bar with precision and thoughtfulness. Sal and the food top notch. The beet salad with fresh horseradish was so Delish! Highly recommend this place
