I have to say our expectations were high after a friend recommended this place. Sorry to say it did not live up to the hype. I had the Florentine eggs Benedict, bacon and home fries. The potatoes were so garlicky that I barely tastes anything else. My husband had the UN deux trois with.a buttermilk pancake that ALSO tasted of garlic. And he never tasted my home fries. We barely finished out meal and will not go back. The Mexican restaurant just down from Zazies had a much more flavorful brunch on our first day in town. Thankfully we arrived just before the crowds and didn't have to wait.

The food is luscious - full of flavour and beautiful seasoning. The hot, hot fresh rolls sold me from the start! One of our guests has a garlic allergy and they were able to provide a lovely meal. The wine was well paired and if the portions were smaller - desserts might have been possible. The staff are knowledgeable and very engaging. What a treasure!

Zazie is truly a gem. The food was incredible and our waitress was one of the best that I ever had. We sat outback in the covered patio, the atmosphere was perfect. I started with the french onion soup, two of us had the beef Bourgignon, one had the pork chop, and my husband had the duck. Every single one of us left with a clean plate. On the menu they explain that there is no tipping, all of their staff is paid a fair wage and they provide a great benefit package to their employees as well. Not only was the food and service out of this world, but knowing how the owners treat their staff, makes Zazie a must go to restaurant!

I love Zazie's, they really are just a wonderful restaurant. You can see why they have survived so long in this city, everything is fresh and tasty and just wonderful. The staff is ALWAYS nice and they try really hard to give you the best service they can. This is the first place in SF to eliminate tipping which has just made the staff even kinder

After walking around Haight Ashbury without finding anywhere to have brunch we can across Zazie by chance, a few blocks walk from main area and what a find this was.From the minute we entered the staff were very friendly and so eager to assist us make our choice, everything on the menu looked very appealing.I opted for Sara Jane's Pancake Flight which consisted of the best pancakes/french toast I have ever tasted and my husband went for the Un, Deux, Trois which was delicious pancakes, eggs and bacon with a side order of home fries.This was the best brunch we had during our month long trip to California, Zazie prides itself on paying all the staff the living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid time off, and a bonus. It is a pleasant change in a city where the tips are an essential part of the salary for many people working in the service industry.If you are in the area please take a trip to Zazie, you will enjoy it !!

Zazie is fine. It's a good little neighborhood bistro. The service is very professional, and the food is good. But I have no idea why hordes of millenials wait for hours on the sidewalk to eat brunch there. Are gingerbread pancakes that rare? I prefer to eat dinner there, just basic good bistro food in the neighborhood, nothing I'd travel for, but I like it.

This place doesn't take reservations so be prepared for a loooong wait. But don't give up coz it's absolutely worth it!The food is delicious- no question about it. The staff is pleasant and makes you feel right at home. Do not miss the eggs Benedict! Or the mimosas :)I also love that they take care of their own. Whoever heard about 401k and paid parental leave for staff at a restaurant? There are companies that don't offer this for their employees. In short, do not miss this place. There aren't many (any?) places like this!

I'll start with my knocks. First, it's kind of out of the way. Cole Valley isn't one of the hot areas in the city to visit, so you probably will have to make a specific trip to get here. Second, the wait is very long. We arrived around 10AM to see many people milling about outside in the sun. Our wait for 2 ended up being about 2 hours. Third, it is a small restaurant, so it's a bit cramped inside, and because of the wait, there's enough social pressure to hustle along.Despite all of those qualifiers, the actual meal was great. The service was friendly, and the menu is standard American brunch fare with a few twists. The menu allows you to order pretty much everything in 1s, 2s, or 3s (e.g. eggs, french toast), and they have a few daily offerings in addition to their regular menu, so you have reasons to go back. We ended up splitting the Tahitian french toast and eggs benedict. Both were delicious, and with 2 pieces each, we were plenty full. Oh, and their home fries are delicious. Definitely get thoseIf I had a reason to come back, I would happily go, but I don't think I would recommend going out of your way for it.

Went here with son and his fiancee to celebrate a birthday. It's unique, tucked in a neighborhood in an older building. The patio is in back, walk through the restaurant to get to it. Vines surround you, and there is heating for a cold day. Service is fast and friendly without being over the top. Food is French-influenced, and carefully prepared and presented. The flavors were delicious. We had a braised lamb and eggplant dish that was tender and flavorful, a beef in red wine that was rich and luscious, and duck breast that was cooked rare to perfection with a fig sauce to die for. Don't miss the macaroni and cheese - it is wonderful. A nice aside: there is no tipping here, as the management pays for employee benefits as well as a living wage. Quite a feat in this expensive locale.

I have to say Zazie is in my top 3 favorite restaurants in the city (which could be partially to do with to the fact that I live in the neighborhood and a 5 minute walk to put my name on the list is pretty easy). The food is wonderful. Most people go for brunch, but the dinner recipes are much better in my opinion! Snag a reservation on a Tuesday evening and there is free corkage. If you go for brunch, make sure to get there an hour+ before you want to be seated as the wait is long and everyone in your party must be there in order to be sat. I also am a big fan of paying a little more for my food and not having to deal with a tip. Love that Zazie treats their staff so well (higher wages than other restaurants) and has a trip free environment.

Came here with 5 friends for dinner on the patio. Prix fixe menu was $49/person for appetizer, entree and desert. I had the goat cheese salad, the salmon and then the mille feuille. The atmosphere is relaxed and the waitstaff is friendly and attentive. The food was pretty good, although if you are French I don't think you will think it's authentic. Nonetheless, it's good food at a reasonable price, with the option of bringing your own wine. 4/5 stars.

Food Not Worth the Overpriced Brunch

The wait was over an hour on a weekend and just by looking at the wait list and the number of people waiting in line, you couldn't help but have great expectations for the food and the ambiance. Well, we finally got our table, got seated, the place was small but with a nice vibe. We then got the menu and we ordered some eggs Benedict; but we were told that we could not get the classical eggs Benedict we asked for, the ones you can order everywhere, but we had to order one of their fancy options that either add prosciutto or whatever else. Bummer! So we ended up with some "fancy" eggs Benedict, $21 per person, the most expensive ones I've ever had, and sorry to disappoint but they were not as good as the regular ones I'm used to have. The bill ended on the very high side for a mediocre brunch, definitely not worth the wait. I don't know why this place is so busy for brunch time, it makes no sense to me, my wife had some "millennial" explanation where perception is more important than taste. I don't know about that but I am not a millennial and as such I was lucky enough to have experienced brunch at what used to be Alta Mira in Sausalito, great food, affordable with a breathtaking view on San Francisco and the Golden Gate. Man, I really miss that place!

I don't get why so many great reviews, the place is nice, the staff is nice... but I'm sorry to say the food was only average; my burger was plain, the potatoes are burned (not in a good way). The egg dishes are good but nothing special. Maybe their ingredients are top notch, but the end products are not. Zazie has many rules, such as no substitutions in any orders, no special requests, my burger was cooked one way, their way of medium. The food at Zazie is not cheap but they do pay their staffs a living wage and offers full benefits, so that's nice.

Friends booked this for us and we were expecting Italian from the name, but its a heavy French influenced menu which was a nice surprise.Its a smallish and cosy place with great ambiance and excellent service. We had the mixed appetizer between 4 of us. This was some chacuterie, salmon tartar, greens and bread, very good. My wife and I followed this with the Bourride Zazie which was magnifique! Its fresh seafood in a broth, which was bursting with flavour.We brought some wine with us for which we were charged a $20 corkage. We did buy another bottle and their wine list is good.A very enjoyable evening and a great meal. On a final note, tipping is not required at this restaurant as they claim to pay their staff a fair wage with benefits, and this is covered in the price of the meal. Bravo!

Cozy Neighborhood Discovery

Most of the reviews for Zazie seem to be focused on Breakfast and/or brunch. Thus, I was curious to see what dinner there would be like. It was our first visit and it was superb! First, the ambiance is quaint, cozy and perfect "neighborhood San Francisco." Tables a bit close together, but place is small. Noise, however, did not seem to be an issue. We dined on the back patio, which was even nicer. A little spacier and still cozy. I had the $39 prix fixe, which included half sized appeitzers (mussels in a delicious cream sauce), half-sized dessert (Creme Brulee, which was , well, creme brulee) and full-sized entree (pasta with broccolini and crisp prosciutto - delicious and highly recommended). My wife had the pork chop (excellent flavor, bone -in, but a bit scrappy) and the soup of the night (ginger carrot - delicious). A couple of additional notes: this restaurant has a highly promoted no-tipping policy. (Hard to adjust to) and, on Tuesdays (when we went) waived corkage fees and/or reduced prices on one white and one red on the wine list (either by the glass or bottle). In summary: a great meal, great ambiance, great waitstaff, great value. We will return.

I took the family for Mother's Day brunch a day early and all of us were delighted by the experience. We arrived at 8:45 to see a huge line out front, but were seated around 10mins after opening - they know how to manage a crowd. Waiter was engaging, on top of everything and very good with my young kids. The waitstaff in general seemed to be having a great time at work - a very positive indicator of solid management. The food came in good time considering the crush the kitchen was under at 9-9:30 on a Saturday. My wife and I had one of the many eggs benedict breakfasts and it was fantastic. Kids had pancakes, which the waiter suggested they split - a welcomed and rare behavior. Overall, the food was excellent as expected. The only caution might be that this restaurant is tight (spacewise) and busy - for those looking for something else. Overall, Zazie deserves all the business it gets!

Went for early Mother's Day brunch on a Saturday. Incredibly crowded. Said the wait would be 20-30 minutes and maybe 50 minutes later we were seated. Service is very good and no tipping is the way they operate, hence the higher prices. Not outlandish though. Coffee cake was the best of our food. Huge piece that three of us shared. Scrambles were just ok and come with salad or potatoes and toast. Tahitian French toast was just too sweet. Many coffee drinks and different kinds of mimosas. Back covered patio and cramped indoor seating with a few tables on the street. Don't know if the wait is worth it. Would go back on weekday though.

My friends, husband and I ate dinner here a few times. We enjoyed the food and service. The restaurant was popular and crowded - we did not mind. They offered seating inside the restaurant and in the back patio with heated lamps. We did not like the hallway between the cooking area and the restroom. This small hallway also lead to the back patio. There was a sewage smell and the ground seemed wet at times. The restroom was tiny. For the same price range, food and service quality, we have eaten at restaurants with better facilities and comfort, such as The Richmond, Chapeau, Sociale, Spruce, Baker Street Bistro.

Every time we visit San Fran, it is a must to do brunch at Zazie's. Be prepared for a long wait (45min+), so plan for it and then you won't be aggravated. Their brunch is delicious, my personal favorite is the french toast. The gingerbread cakes and polenta cakes are also superb. The best reason to support Zazie's is their commitment to providing employees with a living wage and benefits, which is not a restaurant industry custom. So they are even cooler for that. Girls, here's a tip, you can use the bathroom in the bar next door if the line is taking too long.

Zazie's is a fantastic restaurant, has been so for years, and is always a treat. I've eaten there dozens and dozens of times: for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. Alone and with friends and family. I've introduced this restaurant to many people from out of town. The service is reliably great and the serving staff are fun and quirky. The food is absolutely delicious: the eggs, steak, fries, trout, burger...everything. Zazie's has a very loyal following, so plan to go here and possibly to wait -- especially if you're there for brunch. Well worth any wait you might have. A San Francisco icon! One last thing: Zazie's has progressive employment policies, from what I hear from people who work there. An additional plus, especially in this time.

Our first time - Zazie has a good feel and all the waitstaff are pleasant and welcoming. Most of the food was good.......not.......really good or great, but good. Standouts were the potato-leek soup and the trout. My cassoulet was disappointing and from my experience having the dish in France, this wasn't true cassoulet. The ingredients were more or less separate instead of being combined in a rich bean stew. Mussels were good-tasty and fresh. The French Onion Soup hit mostly the right notes. The burger was rated 8/10. Timing from the kitchen was off - my main course, the cassoulet, came 5 minutes after the rest of the party had been served - unsatisfactory. Service was good and the noise level modest. My most accurate rating for Zazie would be 3.5 stars.

This cute French restaurant, in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, is a perfect brunch spot. The wait for a table is super long, but the locals do endure it. Outdoor patio seating is sought after here and is lovely. The menu has French bistro staples and all the American brunch staples as well. There is a weekly pancake special here that people savor. Service here is prompt and friendly. The restaurant prides itself on paying a living wage and benefits to its employees, thus prices here are about 20% higher than a in a comparable restaurant. The upside is that the price hike is compensated by the restaurant asking guests not to tip the staff.

I had the butternut squash pasta which was excellent and my boyfriend had the salmon, which was also good but a very small dish for the price. Overall, we liked the place but found it slightly too pricey for the value.

Best Eggs Benedict Ever

Date: November 16, 2016
I am a little Eggs Benedict addicted and every time that I travel to USA I was planning in advance where I should have my dream brunch. I was able to choose Zazie from Zagat and I had a 2:30 hours train trip to reach Zazie, since I was staying at San Jose. The line for a table was huge, and when the host told me that the waiting was about 2 hours, I almost fainted! He took pity on me and offered a mimosa while I was waiting. So king and gentle! My table was inside at the internal garden, and the place is gorgeous! It was 1:00 pm and I was starving, so I had a 2 Eggs Benedict (you can choose how many eggs you want), with the house prosciutto. The sauce was something from another planet! As a "desert", I ordered a 2 slices of French Toast with orange sauce. Another incredible choice. So, don't give up if the line is too long. The wait will deserved! 

Amazing Brunch

WOW!! What a surprise. Visited Zazie's for my daughter's wedding brunch. The host was most helpful in seating our group--reservations had been made in advance. We were placed in an out of the way area for our party. The servers were most helpful and attentive. We enjoyed a family style brunch and was able to taste bits of everything that had been ordered. What a treat-- try the eggs benedict or the french toast. The atmosphere was very European and contemporary. Price was appropriate considering the quality of food and service. Parking may have been the only drawback. Would highly recommend Zazies and will visit again when in SF.

Really great French influenced food

We thought that both the food and service at Zazie were top-rate. This is not a stuffy French restaurant with servers in formal garb, it's more of an informal bistro atmosphere that is fun and comfortable while offering great food, a good selection of wines, and friendly but professional service.

Though more expensive than we usually pay we really enjoyed the relaxed attitude and local setting of this restaurant. It appears to be situated on the first floor of an old house. There are 2 tables outside, about 14 tables along each side of the main room and a hallway that goes past the kitchen on one side and the prep station on the other and proceeds into an outside sitting area. The waiter was very personnable and the food great. The menu stated tips are not expected! The waiter said the staff are given a living wage and benefits resulting in longevity and satisfied working conditions, it shows!

Big disappointment. Not value for money. Highly rated with no excuse. We took a plate of vegetables for almost 20$ and got 4 pieces of 4 kind of vegetables...one small onion soop also cost the same amount. TripAdvisor this time you disappointed me!

This beautiful little restaurant in Cole Valley is the best in the area. The menu has a nice selection of dishes. We loved the Mediterranean Roasted Veg Plate. The Bourride Zazi and the Boeuf Bourguignon were excellent. All products are very fresh.The staff was extremely friendly.We would love to come back.

Our group of 4 (plus 2 kids) came here on a Friday morning at 8:20 and it was already pretty full. There wasn't a table large enough for our group so we waited about a half hour for the back patio to open. Definitely worth the wait for the back patio. The heat lamps were a nice bonus. My husband and I ordered the divorcee eggs benedict and the buttermilk pancakes. Both were really good. If I weren't so full I would have loved to try more from their menu. Everything looked so delicious -- even the simple scrambled eggs our friends' kids ordered. Definitely recommend this place. Plus, Cole Valley is such a cool part of town. It's worth coming to Zazie for the food and the cute neighborhood.

Amazing brunch &amp; authentic French dishes for dinner!

I've been here multiple times for brunch and the food has always been superb - favorites include the crab Benedict, the "le metro" spritzer with a fresh sprig of lavender as well as their potatoes that are served with the most perfectly roasted garlic. I came here for dinner last week for the first time and had a fabulous meal of boeuf bourginon and sticky toffee cake/date pudding dessert. My beef was so tender and full of flavor. My friend had their onion soup which was excellent and not too salty. I was pleasantly surprised with the authenticity of their French dishes, and also happy that it wasn't as crowded as it normally is for brunch. Safe to say, I will definitely be back for more brunches and dinners in the future!

Great food worth the long wait. Four of us arrived at Zazie's for brunch around 10 AM to find that the Cole Street Fair was ongoing. A nice distraction as we waited for our party to be called from the long list. We were finally seated in the outside seating area around 11:10 AM. Service was excellent, our orders were taken quickly and our food served amazingly fast considering the size of the kitchen. The Pierre Noir got rave reviews.

A surprisely delight but stay away

Stay away because they are busy enough (probably not from the owner's perspective!) but busy enough to make walk-ins hard to accommodate and people from outside this somewhat quiet neighborhood crowd out the locals (I say all this somewhat tongue-in-cheek!). The menu is interesting but not overwhelming and with sufficient variety to work for most people and tastes. For example, we had crispy duck, pasta, and bouillabaisse (probably a French word for this but it escapes me at the moment). The portions are good, meaning not enormous but filling and well-plated. Prices are commensurate with the high quality, and service is quite attentive. We ate "outside", through the kitchen and covered with heat lamps, and the noise escaped easily although we were seated close to other diners/tables. We did not save room for dessert, and those choices also looked scrumptious.

Get there early to get a table.

Amazing food and all the locals know it! This little restaurant is packed full of big flavors! It's a good thing I don't live close because I would never want to go anywhere else. I ate Oatmeal Creme Brule and I loved it!

75 minute wait...not an A ride at Disney

We had heard everything you ate here was "to die for". Well, I did want to kill my husband after he made me wait 75 minutes for brunch. Almost NO meal is worth that kind of wait, even a free meal is not worth that wait, no view! Come on. Heck, I eat out everyday, sleep in a hotel 365 days a year, travel my butt off. I cannot believe I feel for this.Yes, I tried the Sara Jane's Pancake Flight for $19 - 1 buttermilk, 1 ginger, 1 french toast. It was good, maybe worth a 15 minute wait and the server was a very sweet man, again maybe worth another 10 minutes. The outside porch, no view, not worth the wait. The coffee and tea (which was very odd, I asked for honey, they said they were out and then said wait, I think we have a tablespoons worth! Where did they find and nope, I am good. Again, I have eaten at some dives that have great food, holes in the wall (with holes in the wall) with the best food, guys fighting outside over a table, etc. All kind of places from North Africa to South Bay. Again, not worth 75 minutes, you only have one life, don't waste it waiting in line. Go enjoy your life, make a reservation at another place and use the 75 minutes seeing an art gallery, seeing a movie, whatever floats your boat!

The food was wonderful and the outdoor decking was perfect. Do not like the cold? Don't worry they have outdoor heating. A wide array of food choices. From French of course, morroccan and burgers as well. I had the morroccan lamb this time. Not too spicy. Just right. Will be back.

A wonderful dinning experience awaits you in a neat neighborhood of Cole Valley. And here is a tip: the restaurant is of the "no tip" persuasion. Now to the question: Can you honestly say that you've had a fabulous chicken entree and escape being frowned upon by the taste skeptics?Before going there, let us set the table. Six for dinner, encompassing a wide range of taste buds. A challenge indeed for any restaurant; bridging the culinary spectrum. At Zazie it was done seamlessly.A few examples for the starters: Salade Toscanes, a dish made with heirloom tomatoes, fresh as can be mozzarella, terrific black olives, and a just perfectly balanced basil vinaigrette. Total yumminess. And then there is a breathtaking combo of grilled figs, chevre, and wilted arugula, on grilled levain. Also top-notch. Onto a couple of the entrees. But first to the question concerning credibility and chicken. No, it is not prepared in your usual manner; instead, a breast is stuffed with mushrooms and herbs. Tasted by the doubters and the unanimous verdict: merely marvelous. Yes, do give it a try.Two more goodies--make that greaties--, the Moroccan lamb tangine and the grilled pork chop.The dinning experience ensures that there will be a repeat visit when we are in the area.Try it!

Came to San Francisco for the weekend and my friend and I were looking for a good place for breakfast/brunch. A friend told us about Zazie so we decided to give it a try.The food was excellent. I have the eggs Benedict (for which they have a lot of options) and it was amazing. I got it with the home fries which were phenomenal. The hollandaise sauce wasn't too rich.It's in an older building, with fun, French inspired decorations and a garden in the back to eat.There was a bit of a wait, but since we didn't care where we sat (indoor or outdoors) we got a seat in less than 5 minutes. It was a bit cramped, but it was still nice.The service was a bit slow, but it was very busy, so it was expected. I ordered a cappuccino and it arrived quite quickly, but the food took a little bit. But that just means it was done up fresh!It is a bit on the pricier side, but I feel like San Francisco is like that in general. For 2 eggs Benedict, with the 1 egg option, and just one cappuccino it came up to 33 dollars. Although, they don't expect you to tip, so there is that trade off.All in all it was a great experience, and I would definitely go there again. 

Best brunch spot in San Francisco!

We ate here as a party of 9. They sat us outdoors and although it was chilly, it didn't matter because not only do they have outdoor heating, they gave us a nice, soft blanket as well! (I get cold easily, so this was a super bonus!) The wine list is reasonably priced with some excellent choices and the menu was equally wonderful. I had the crispy duck leg which was perfectly cooked and my husband had the ravioli which was rich and delicious. I'd return here in an instant!

We found this gem on trip advisor and were not disappointed! The service, ambience of the back patio, and good were fabulous! We had the duck and stuffed chicken which were both divine. We had the salad which was very fresh. The crumble aux fruit with strawberry rhubarb was very good as well. We would highly recommend Zazies and will be back if we return to SF. Reasonably priced and well worth it!

Very Good Local Restaurant

Zazie is our neighborhood restaurant. We have been there dozens of times. The quality is always solid, the service good and the food tasty. It is known for its weekend brunches, but frankly neighborhood locals don't go then because of all the out of neighborhood hipsters (and hipstresses) lined up at that time. Try it for breakfast during the week, or dinner any day, unless you want the social experience of hanging out on Cole Street waiting for a table.Although I am only giving 4 stars, this should not be seen as a knock -- it is just that I consider Zazie a very good local restaurant, not something I would drive across town for.

This place is highly rated, people are queuing but sorry it is a very ordinary breakfast with bad coffee and cold food! When it comes to the hygiene of the kitchen you better do not look because it will cut your appetite! Sorry but i do not know how this place can have so many good ratings! They charge nearly 4 dollars for a mini glas of canned orange juice! One time was enough! Service was ok!

The breakfast here is delicious! The service is also extremely good. This is a must dine restaurant if you're after a great breakfast.Be aware, it is busy and you will have to wait for a table. You can put your name on waiting list to be seated inside or you can just wait on a table outside where it's basically first person to put their bum on the seat gets a table..Love breakfast?? Eat here!!

Line up early to get a seat! We were lucky enough to be able to enjoy a breakfast while sitting outside. The breakfast menu is extensive - everyone will find something they like.

We dropped in for breakfast, quickly seated and attended by efficient non-hovering staff. Relaxed cafe vibe. Food was delicious, can not fault anything. They have a no tip policy as they pay staff a living wage, individual items may look a bit more pricey (but not much!) but the customer wins in the long run. Fabulous, I wish more US restaurant s would adopt this civilized policy. I would rush back given the chance.
