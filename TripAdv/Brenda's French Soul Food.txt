The best place for great food and music for brunch. Although there was about a 45 minute wait, the weather was great and the customers in line were friendly. Once inside, you did not feel rushed to finish your meal at all. The specials were absolutely delicious. Four of us tried to eat everything! The gumbo was great, the frittata with crayfish and other goodiess was delicious as were the cheese grits, and flight of beignets! Too bad I live so far away...

I went here for brunch on a weekend during an SF trip as suggested by my friend. We had to wait for 20 minutes I think but it's all worth it. That was the first time I tried beignets which was really good! I remember they also serve good coffee!

You would think that you're in New Orleans when you sample the food at Brenda's. Our group of 4 all tried something different and we were delighted with the quality and overwhelmed by the quantity! The cheddar grits are to die for, and the sausage and eggs were amazingly good. We made sure to save room for the beignets and coffee! Believe me, you won't be disappointed. A taxi driver told my daughter that this was where the locals eat breakfast!

Brenda's is in the "gritty" Tenderloin district, and beware: lines are LONG on weekends. I was lucky, traveling solo I was seated immediately; otherwise it was a 40 minute wait at 9:30 AM. Decor is eclectic and fun. I had one of the specials, an egg & sausage tartine with roasted potatoes. Service was excellent, my coffee was kept full and my order arrived in good time (especially when they were so busy). The tartine was one of their "famous" cream biscuits topped with a yummy bbq sauce, cheese, sausage, and an egg (scrambled). The potatoes were good, the tartine was AMAZING.

We loved our dinner at this relaxed restaurant. The savoury beignet for starter was massive and easily enough for two to share. The fried chicken was deliciously crispy and the shrimp and grits totally hit the spot. Service was relaxed and friendly. It was easy to get a table early-ish on a Friday night and there were no queues at all. We walked there in daylight but it's a bit sketchy, didn't feel safe walking back in the dark so caught a cab. Would love to go back for breakfast or brunch.

Brenda's French Soul Food

Brenda's has become one of our staples when visiting San Francisco. It is located in the Tenderloin District (just adjacent the civic center) and easy to get to. However, because of its popularity expect a line and be patient as it's worth the wait. One critical point, one you arrive be sure to GO INSIDE AND WRITE YOUR NAME ON THE RESERVATION BOARD. Space is tight but comfortable. The notion of French Soul has intriquing but once you see the robust menu you may have a better understanding of why it is used. The food is very good and has a taste of New Orleans, southern and french style dishes.The price is mid-range but affordable. Brenda's has three restaurants in the area which each catering to specific menu options. Just a few doors down is Libby's, which is more take-out and in the Western Edition District on Divisadero Street is Brenda's Meet and Three.

The beignets are wonderfully light with very flavorful filling. My favorite was the crawfish. Their shrimp and grits rivaled what I had in Savannah and the creole seafood frittata was delicious. Try their cream biscuits. Not the yeasty style I'm used to, but good none the less.

Absolutely delicious, amazing food. There was a long wait (1 hour), with people outside on the sidewalk waiting to get in, so the wait was pretty enjoyable and totally worth it. Reasonable prices, top notch food and friendly service. I had a seafood/cajun fritatta with grits and biscuit, GF had fried chicken benny, both were to die for. Apple beignet - forget about it!There are some less-than-friendly looking streets in the area, however, so pick wisely your path there. We bussed from the financial district down Market, got off somewhere around Hyde and walked from there. We didn't actually have any issues, but it was sketchy. Heading up Van Ness Ave, then over on Eddy St. seemed pretty good, as we got a coffee at Philz on Van Ness while waiting (great coffee!)

Had a delicious lunch here with my husband. We went there based on TripAdvisor reviews, though it was a bit out of our way - totally worth it! Customer service was amazing and food was authentic and delicious. The beignets were a highlight, though I couldn't finish them as the portions were so large! We took the rest away with us and had them for breakfast the next day (still delicious)

This food was delicious, but warning, make sure you know the meals before you order it! I ordered the BFC, straight to the point fried chicken, collard greens, mash potatoes and two sauces: a pepper jelly sauce and a peach marmalade for the biscuit. THE BISCUIT WAS TO DIE FOR! Unfortunately we ordered two drinks and never received it, however, in a blink of an eye our food came out, it could be that we were there an hour before closing but still really quick! But if it is your first time there, stick to the BFC, you will not be disappointed.

The gumbo is delicious and hearty and that in itself makes it a worth the visit. Our po boys were good and the cole slaw was excellent. We saw other customers with fried chicken, beignets and other specialties and everything looked delicious and plentiful. The waiters could have been a little friendlier, especially since it didn't get busy until after our food was served. Even so, were still very glad we went to Brenda's French Soul Food and we will go again when in SF.

We visited for breakfast on Sunday after a recommendation from our hotel nearby. My boyfriend arrived at opening time to grab a table and it was already very busy. We had actually walked past the day before and seen long lines then as well, so it is clearly very popular in the area and expect a wait.Once seated, we were well greeted and our food arrived quickly. The portions at Brenda's are very big and hearty. I ordered the tofu hash, including a biscuit, with a side of grits and my boyfriend ordered the poached eggs and bacon with hash. The food was very tasty, I felt like I needed to add a bit more seasoning, but with salt, pepper and hot sauce on the table I was happy to adjust it to my preference. I actually could not finish all of my food and it kept me full until dinner. I was happy at the amount of vegetarian choices on offer. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and atmospheric, although the tables are quite close together to pack in all of Brenda's fans. Reasonably priced for San Francisco and the quality of food. We paid around $40 for the two of us, including drinks.

We knew the queues would be long for Sunday brunch but decided to take our chances and trust the reviews were accurate. The line actually moved quite quickly and was well managed by staff. Truly impressive breakfast but be aware that the servings are exceedingly generous. We over ordered as everything sounded so delicious and we were not disappointed. The pulled pork po boy was amazing as was the oyster omelette. The beignet flight was definitely not required but very much enjoyed. We walked from Nob Hill and our route was a tad "seedy". Would uber or approach from Market St if visiting at night.

When you walk in to this restaurant the vibe appears a bit casual, even scatty, dare I say it, possibly a bit French(?). Don't be fooled, a smooth and efficient operation runs beneath a relaxed veneer. . The staff were professional and polite. At the very moment the thought entered your head that you needed something, there they were. The food, not to mention quick, was outrageously good. My wife and I just looked at each other, no words of compliment required. To top it all off, it was priced perfectly.

Ate here twice and loved it. First time was breakfast. You come in and write your name on the chalkboard then they call you for breakfast. It's close quarters and a good chance if you're a couple that you're sharing a table very closely with another couple. Get the Bloody Mary it's spicy but delicious. Also get the beignets. I ordered dinner through the Caviar app. It came right on time. I got the fried chicken and I loved it!!

Got there n a weekday and the chalk board with names waiting reached three columns ! Yikes We added our name to the bottom of column three. Told it would be an hour so we headed to the Asian Art Museum for a short time and got back in 40 minutes. They called our name and move on. Let them know we were back and luckily we were just another group of five. Whew. Of note, if you are a single or pair and are willing to sit ar their "bar" (five or so seat near the entrance with lots of traffic), you may get lucky and seats quickly. In general plan on waiting. No reservations.They serve both breakfast and lunch til 1500 hours. Tempted by breakfast but opted for the lunch. We split their chicken plate and I had the soup. The food has a Cajun flair to it with "home cooking". Very fluffy biscuit. Cole slaw was solid but did not knock my socks off. The chicken was very tasty and moist but had a little extra oil on it. Note- I would re-order that being said. I had the chickery coffee but was too full to try their strawberry beignets which sounded yummy. Other items order included fried shrimp sandwich, salad. Not all the food arrived at the same time leaving one of us who ordered a salad waiting while the rest of us ate uncomfortably. The place was noisy and hard to converse.

We were a group of 12 - 6 adults and 6 children and found out about Brenda's on Trip Advisor. We were delighted that the reviews were accurate and that Brenda's is definitely worth the visit. Breakfast varies from French Toast to Beignets to Full cooked breakfast to a stack of pancakes. All were delicious and our group was delighted. It was extremely good value and the service was good. Highly recommended.

Must have the shrimp and grits

Date: August 9, 2017
I'll start off with saying I don't care for seafood and have never had shrimp and grits. And I feel this set the bar. It was so delicious, good texture, just the right amount of heat without being overboard and cheesy. My mouth is watering just the thought of having it again. Why I didn't give five stars was because we ordered French toast with the pecan sauce. What was served was their special of banana foster French toast. When we mentioned it to the sever he just said 'oh where did that go?" After waiting over ten minutes we I figured it was just my problem. The French toast was decent but I just wasn't interested in it any longer and maybe ate half a slice. They did make up for it by taking it off the bill. I guess my full plate was a clear indication of my dissatisfaction. Also tried the flight of beignets. They were good. Not the best I've ever had but good. The apple one was by far the best. Would I recommend going? Yes! Please have the shrimp and grits.

Disappointed. The place was busy and figured it would be good; however, my order was incorrectly interpreted. Had our server bothered to check back it could have been fixed rather quickly with no problem. By time he came back and I told him of the mistake, he just said oh I thought you said this. Then disappeared again and ignored us. Finally says that it's on it's way out, to which I said no thank you, I'd rather not. He said I could take it to go. So 10 mins go by, finally the food comes out, sits there for another 10 mins before he comes back, slams the box down with the check. Never apologized nor took it off the bill. Not sure what we did to deserve such rude service, because while it was very busy, he seemed very attentive to all the other tables, even making conversation with the people who sat next to us.

Stopped by at 10:00 on a Tuesday morning, zero wait. Score.  Had a server that seated me and then took my order. Got the beignets - a little heavy, a ton of food for one person.Different server (Justin) came up to me to see if I wanted to order an entree, told him I wasn't sure yet and he stalked away. Came back and asked again and when I said I still hadn't decided, he pulled the menu from the table and never returned. Nearly an hour in the restaurant - never a refill on coffee, never checked in to see if I wanted to order. Would skip over my table as he bounced between the table to the left and the right of me. Suffocatingly petty. I had to go to the bev station to get my own water from another server after he ignored me when I asked as he was passing (sure, maybe he didn't hear me, but it wasn't very busy at all and not very loud in restaurant).Rest of the staff was fantastic. Other menu options looked great.Pretty disappointing.

First off this is NOT SOUL Food, food for the soul? Maybe. I had such high hopes and we took the 20 min walk from the hotel through sketchy streets and homeless tents. The food lack real flavor and seasoning that which makes real "soul food " soul food. I'm from the south so when you advertise soul food that's what I expect. The beignets are ok certainly not worth $6 if you've every had them from Cafe du mode or in other restaurant in New Orleans then you'll recognized these are nowhere close. The atmosphere was great, customer service phenomenal. The food despite the Hail Mary reviews is a definite pass. Not to mention our breakfast (2 people) was $53.

The decor is really appealing, when we were seated we noticed the that the place was very eclectic and had a hint of a New Orleans feel. The food was great, the shrimp and grits was just right. I'm not a big fan of cheese on my grits but Brenda's definitely gets two thumbs up on it from me. Also tried the pecan French toast, it was so good I had to fight my wife for pieces of the pecans. My wife had the Hangtown Fry that had oysters, ham, bacon and peppers inside. We also tried the crawfish beignet - never had this before but will have it again. It was delicious. Try and experiment while you are there, you never know what you might like.

Brenda's is one of my favourite restaurants, and one of my favourite brunch places! I simply adore their shrimp and grits. They have generous portions and their food is really good and flavorful. I haven't tried anything bad here yet. They certainly know how to fry -- their beignets were fantastic, in my own humble opinion, and not greasy or thick. Just light and fluffy as can be on the inside. You can get a flight of beignets to sample each one, though I prefer just the plain one usually. The crawfish beignet is a must-try though! This place tends to get full a lot of the time, so I usually visit at the odd hours on a weekday so that I don't have to wait in line for a table. All in all, I always have such a pleasant experience upon every visit and is part of my regular/go-to must-eat-at places list!

We were hesitant to try this because we travel often to New Orleans and love the food. And we were right. The shrimp and grits were disappointing, not a good texture on the grits. The Hangout fry was very good, with plenty of oysters. Beignets were different than NOLA, more cakey, but good. Yuk on the hash browns, had a chlorine taste to them. Beignet, done that, won't go back.

Trendy spot with a usual long wait but so worth it.My wife had a Pulled pork Po'Boy with fries as a special and it was really good. I opted for the chorizo omelette with potatoes and a biscuit, all aspects were terrific. However the "little secret" was the homemade strawberry jam for the biscuit, what a treat. I believe their jellies and pickled watermelon rind are available for sale. If you don't mind the wait everything is well worth it.

We've been to Brenda's a few times over the years but what keeps me from going back more frequently is the neighborhood. I hate this neighborhood in the Tenderloin. Full of filthy, street peddlers. We were walking in the rain to Brenda's when this bum walked by in in the opposite direction put out his hand for a handout. I shook my head "no" and he slaps me on the shoulder with the back of his hand. I should've clobbered him. Really ruins your morning. Because of that, I don't plan to go back to Brenda's at this location for a while even 'tho I do like the food.The food was good but not as good as I remembered from our last visit. Hubby had the usual eggs Benedict type breakfast. I had tea and the grits. It was OK as was service. I didn't think our server was particularly friendly.

We loved Brenda's, both for the dishes and for the the vibe. It seemed to be THE place to be be on a cold, cloudy July weekday because it immediately brightened up our day and made us grin with food-induced joy. Would go back for the Grillard n Grits anytime...

Managed to visit for breakfast on my last morning in San Francisco and so glad I did. Portion sizes are generous and delicious and both my mom and I were stuffed by the time we left. We shared the shrimp and grits, which was delicious as well as the beignet flight so we could try all 4 kinds. We both agreed the crawfish was our favourite, followed by the chocolate one. We only managed to eat two before packing the rest up, but the other two were still delicious hours later in the airport. The watermelon tea was also really tasty. Highly recommended place not in the usual touristy area of the city!

Get there early. Food definitely for the soul

If you really want to enjoy a great breakfast, get to Brenda's early (they open at 8:00 a.m.) enjoy the chicory coffee and Nola inspired food for the soul. Grillard n Grits with a flaky biscuit, ooooooh so yummy. Saw so many dishes and wished I could taste them all. I'll be back for sure.

Casual friendly and busy at early Sunday brunch. Bless the coffee! Very authentic NOLA inspired fare that does have a soul food inflection. Attentive and agile staff. Had the Hangtown Fry (eggs, oysters, bacon, scallions). No way I could have had the beignets as well tho they looked amazing. Would love to come back and try other stuff. Note that you walk through the Tenderloin to get there and that's a stark reminder that your privileged breakfast is a block away from scores of homeless people which will appropriately awaken your social conscience. You have to ask how this can exist in the riches country on earth. 

Great out off the beaten path spot

Although we had to wait 40 minutes this was a little different spot we thought we would find in San Francisco. The fried chicken Benedict was amazing on a fresh biscuit that was perfect. My wife had a pulled pork po boy that wad delicious some watermelon ice tea and a beniget made the wait worth it. Definitely visit this cool little spot.

Oh my, the food was outstanding and the service impeccable. They had the creamiest grits I've ever had and I live in NC! The beignets were awesome and reminded me of New Orleans. No one in my party of 6 regretted their choices for their meal.

When you feel your food tastes WOW that's when I give 5 stars!!!1st time at Brenda's and 1st time having grits and that crispy pork belly cheddar grits plate had my name on it! What a beautiful combination of the crispy pork, poached egg and the relish with the cheesy grits. You can probably ask for easy on the cheese if you don't like it that heavy for breakfast. Good size for one person compared with the egg dishes which were a tad too big.My friends ordered the 2 eggs dish that came with potatoes, sausage (extra) and biscuit. They liked it but their portions were really big so they couldn't finish.We also shared chocolate beignets which were too die for! Needless to say we couldn't finish them all so packed it to go.Menu is simple with lots of great options and different prices. Staff is friendly and fast. Places is nice and buzzing and bathrooms are clean.There is always a waiting line for this place, yep, even on a thursday morning. the lines started getting busy at 10am so come earlier if you want to miss the crowds.Need to come back!!!

I read a number of reviews that said to make sure you order off the specials board....which I promptly forgot once we went. BUT our meals were still delicious and more than hearty. I had the Egg and Bacon Tartine - the tomato-bacon relish made the ENTIRE dish. I've never tasted anything like it and I would have gladly taken a gallon home with me. The star of the show was definitely the Chocolate Beignets. Order it and eat it while it's hot - trust me, it's worth the burnt mouth.

Went for dinner with 2 others... Place was pretty full, but we were seated fast. 2 orders of Fried chicken and on order of rice and beans. Then we wait... The food arrived in 2-3 minutes! Lightening speed. The fried chicken was perfect. The bun was fresh and light. The greens were a bit on the bitter side for me, but I guess they were healthy.Would recommend and would go again.

Large portion of fried oysters in sourdough roll with . Small restaurant and very busy at lunch time but you may sit solo at side counter to avoid long wait. Names written on chalk board as reservations are not taken. Quite a long walk from Geary Blvd so transfer at Van Ness and take bus from there.

Brenda's is a cute little restaurant with interesting decor. There is often a wait. Food is pretty good, but it is definitely not traditional soul food.

Perhaps a 20 minute walk from my Union Square hotel but the food was so much better than the tourist haunts around the Square - wonderful southern style food, a good pork belly on a bed of grits with lots of spice and tang.Service not too good , coffee was slow and hard to ask a few times for water.

We enjoyed an extremely filling breakfast. Absolutely delicious biscuits with fabulous jam, overstuff omelettes, delicate beignet, mouth watering French toast and eggs! Quaint interior space and great service! We went at 10 am and wait was not bad at all but I would assume early morning rush can be hectic!

This is a good place if you want to enjoy and original American breakfast. Very busy on Sunday morning and completely full of local people but also some tourists. Quick and friendly staff will guide you through your huge breakfast. Unforgettable!

The Most Amazing Shrimp &amp; Grits
Rating: 5
Date: April 6, 2017
I visited Brenda's with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and waited well over an hour to be seated. The wait was well worth it and we passed the time next door at a small cafe associated with Brenda's, where we shared a bacon biscuit with pimento cheese spread & and a blueberry biscuit with fruit spread, both so darn delicious. My friend and I finally got called to be seated at the bar, which was uncomfortable, as I hate to eat at a bar. However, we sat and forgot all about the bar when our order of Shrimp n Grits came out. We both agreed it was the best bowl of Grits we've had, hands down. Creamy grits, shrimp that melted in your mouth and the most delicious, sweet tomatoes that added another burst of flavor. Needless to say, we could not stop talking about the grits all weekend. Go get these Grits!!

New Orleans style food at San Francisco style prices. They serve breakfast until 3P. Nice menu with vegetarian and vegan options. Write your name on the chalk board to get on the wait list. The food is excellent and the service is pretty good. If you are in a hurry, it is quite crowded. I liked the veggie omelet. Will try the vegan Josephine next time. With the density of good places to eat, I am not sure it is worth the wait. Near the Asian Art Museum.

Wow!!! First, a big thank you to TA phone app and fellow reviewers for their recommendations. What a find in a section of SFO that one wouldn't expect to find such a wonderful place. We had an early lunch at Brenda's and the place was jammed packed at 11:30a.m!!!! Now as far as the food goes...here we go:The catfish Po' Boy was 10 out of 10.The oyster Po' Boy was 15 our of 10...oh yes!!The Southern Fried Chicken and fries was 20 out of 10.And last but not least, the Beignets, specially the Chocolate one...out of this worldGreat Service, fast and not fussy. The whole experience was just great.

Had dinner with a friend and we ordered different plates to share. He ordered the fried chicken and I had the shrimp and grits. Fried chicken was excellent, had a bit of spicy to it but seasoned and fried very crispy. For an appetizer we ordered mac and cheese and it was definitely creamy cheesy. My shrimp and grits were pretty good, had just a little too much cheese on the grits but worth trying. Finally, don't skip dessert. Must order the Beignets, plain with powdered sugar. I had to take one to go because they were excellent. Can't wait to visit again.

A must try .

Recently traveled to San Francisco for a business trip. Found Brenda's French Soul Food online, had great reviews, and I agree! Delicious breakfast food!!! Amazing beignets! Ordered the "Creole Veggie Omelet"! Fabulous! Excellent service! I will visit this restaurant again next time I am in San Francisco. Wish they would open a restaurant in Chicago! Think about it Brenda!:)

You cannot come to San Francisco without coming to Brenda's French Soul Food. It is absolutely delicious. My friends and I went around 10 am on a Friday morning. It was a short wait, approximately 20 minutes. You write your name on the chalkboard when you arrive and put a number to how many is in your party. The waiting area is not large, so you may have to stand outside to wait, but that is okay because the food makes up for it. One of my friends who went with me is a New Orleans native. She said this restaurant definitely did New Orleans justice. I say it's just delicious. YOU CANNOT COME HERE WITHOUT ORDERING THE BEIGNETS! They are so wonderful. We ordered two plates and split them between the four of us. I ordered the veggie omelet with the potato hash. The biscuit was a good, hearty, southern biscuit - the way biscuits should be. There's a jar of peach marmalade on each table. Do try it. It is delicious. I bought a jar to take back home, as well, which cost $10. Note- Brenda's does not separate the bill for your party. You receive the total bill and you can tell your waiter how much to charge each credit card, or pay cash.Overall, the service was great, the food was wonderful, and the atmosphere was perfect. I would go back again for breakfast and give it a 5 star review.
