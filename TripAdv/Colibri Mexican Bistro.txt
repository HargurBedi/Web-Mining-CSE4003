Really enjoyed our dinner here - such a comfortable environment with the main bar central to the dining area. The selection of margaritas is awesome and our waiter gave us really good advice catering to our different tastes. And the food was really superb as well. All around a great dinner out.

As I got in I was starving and there was a waiting list to sit on the tables so I decided to sit at the bar and it was the best thing! At the bar you get to be more integrated to the place and is also a comfordable place. Everything was wonderful there, the wine, the food, the scenario and the moment!

Nice change of pace after a day on the water sightseeing. Thoroughly enjoyed the pollo poblano with a nice bottle of Pinot noir that complemented the chocolate in the sauce. Guacamole was made to order just right and charros for dessert were delicious. Rosie was our server and was very nice and informed and made several recommendations that were spot on. 

So good I came here two days in a row

Excellent lunch specials here - for an extra $5 they toos in an excellent house margarita. Had enchiladas one day (green and red sauce "divorcio") and carne asada tacos the next day. You get warm corn tortillas and 3 salsas with every order, but tortilla chips are also available. Come early to avoid the lunchtime crowds and you will go away full and happy.

this is one of the BEST Mexican restaurants we have ever visited. We turned up announced, no booking on a Sunday night and the place was packed - no trouble ! waited maybe 2 minutes and a table was ready for us. Before we make any further comments THE BEST GUACAMOLE ON THE PLANET !!!the visit alone is worth it for the Gauc.!All the food is full of flavour , with just the right combination of heat . Hey its mexican , you gotta have heat !!We will go back to San Fran just to eat here

Was invited to join a small group going for a late dinner at Colibri. We probably went at latest possible time and appreciated fact that we were served without any pressure. Food was good overall but the menu was somewhat odd - a fair amount of Mexican style starters but there was nothing too Mexican about the mains. Still, food quality was good and restaurant is in a great location if you are in downtown.

1. My fork and spoon had a noticeable green marks on the back. I wanted to believe it was part of the design. I asked the hostess and she confirmed it wasn't: it was dirty cutlery. There was old lettuce incorporated into the cutlery from God knows how long ago!2. It took an hour for the kitchen to deliver our order (brunch egg dish and fish ceviche).3. The ceviche was marinating in an overly acidic and stringent salsa which made the throat ache.4. Service was slow and inattentive.Never again. And we are not even tourists!

This place has amazing brunch. The food is fresh and delicious. They brought homemade tortillas and salsa to start the meal. Each of the three salsas had a unique flavor, and the tortillas were incredible. Their version of eggs Benedict was perfect. Service was great as well. Highly recommend checking this place out.

I had just landed in San Fran and was so hungry - the hotel suggested this place. It is small but very lively and luckily I was able to get a table because it was packed. Service was attentive and my meal came out pretty fast. I enjoyed a glass of red wine and for a Mexican place, was thankful they had a good few options. If you like Tequila, this is your place because they had a huge selection. While I waited for my food, they came out with hand made corn tortillas and three dipping sauces/salsas and all three were good. My favorite was the red/medium. I ordered the Tinga (Chicken) Tostadas and they were delicious. I also got the Mexican Grilled Corn - delicious! My server brought a steak knife so I could cut the corn off the cob - corn can get messy.Prices were good for the quality of food I got. Craving it again now today!

We visited this restaurant for lunch and drinks while waiting for our room to be ready at The Drake. It was a Saturday afternoon do unfortunately they were still on the brunch menu. We shared the quacomole and chips which was very good. Margaritas were also good. My husband had the steak entree and he enjoyed it. The tostadas were delicious and an unexpected treat. This restaurant is large and has a lively crowded bar.

Found this restaurant near to our hotel in San Francisco and I'm so glad we did. If you are looking for enchiladas, flautas, burritos or tacos then keep looking. This place is so much better than that! The guacamole is full of flavour and beautifully served with homemade corn tortillas. We had lamb, duck and prawns as main courses. Everything was cooked beautifully and bursting with flavour.For afters, we ordered the churros and we're not disappointed. What a gorgeous finish to the meal. The caramel ice cream was absolutely divine. I could have eaten a tub of it. Service was good and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. It is a bit pricey but I expected that in San Francisco.If you are looking for a unique Mexican dining experience try Colibri; we loved it!

Cosmos &amp; Churros, over the moon

I hesitate to write this review as even more people will swarm to this wonderful restaurant. There were 8 of us. We had a 6:30 reservation but we were early. They were kind enough to clear a table and seat us within 5 minutes. No attitude. Service was prompt. They begin with bottled water left on the table, plus chips, small warm tortillas and 3 different salsas, each with a varying degree of heat. We had the Carnitas, the Camarones Mole, the Filete Mignon, and the Panuchos de Cochinita Pibil, plus gauc and a salad (Ensalada de Betabeles). Everyone enjoyed their meals. At first the portions look small, but by the time you indulge in the tortillas, chips, salad, whatever libation you're having, we had margauritas,ginger-ritas, beer and a cosmo, the portions are perfect. It's muy importante not to over indulge because you will want to save room for desserts. OMG! Again. OMG! I swear I could just go in their for drinks and dessert. My favorite is the Churros rellenos. I don't even like churros, but these are over the moon. 4 warm churros filled with caramel served with a side of dulce de leche ice cream. The combo of the warm dough, plus the caramel, with the cold sweet ice cream is worth every damn calorie. Being a sweet-toothed, adventuresome crew, we also had the flan, the mango cream brulee, and the pastel de chocolate (think lava cake with vanilla ice cream). All were delicious. We never felt rushed. It was a marvelous meal with great service, and I highly recommend it. I will say I think that the guacamole is over-priced at $16.00, but aside from that this is a swell spot if you're anywhere near the Union Sq, theatre district. Reservations highly recommended. Bottom line: Cosmopolitans & caramel churros, does it get any better?

We returned to this cantina style restaurant because the food was memorably good. We ordered the sopes and pozole for lunch. It is consistently crowded and I'm sure the food is the reason why. For Mexican fare, the cost is higher than expected. Service does not come with a smile and it is rather slow. I didn't mind because I was enjoying the ambiance and my meal. I look forward to returning. I hear the brunch is especially good.

We dropped in for drinks and after viewing the menu, stayed for dinner. We ate at the bar - and got fast, really good service. This is not a beans & rice place: it's a taste of really fine Mexican food, prepared like our Hispanic mother would make it. Hand made tortillas, nopales for a side dish and really excellent carnitas & chicken. As for ambiance: in the bar there were old comedy movies from Mexico. It's located very conveniently across from the Curran Theater and close to Union Square. The prices are not cheap and neither is the quality. Nice place with a great vibe! We'll be back for sure.

We were greeted by the kindest waitress named Rosie. She clearly had way too many tables as she was doing her best to keep up. We ordered the guacamole, fish tacos and mole chicken dish.

Visited this last weekend with my husband for a late lunch. We had one main course chicken dish, a side vegetable dish and an appetizer tostado chicken dish, along with a Diet Coke and water to drink. Total bill with tip was about $60 so a little on the high side. The main course was not that large but the other two dishes were a good size. The food was flavored well-definitely had a kick and was very tasty! The service was good and the restaurant had a great ambience. It is down the hill in the Nob Hill area. I would definitely recommend returning in the future, the only negative was a higher price tag.

Colibri caters to people who truly wish to experience great Mexican food. It is not a big restaurant but busy every night of the week. We were walking by every evening on our way to the hotel. The service was excellent and quick. The portions are a nice size but the food more on the spicy side, therefore it's a question of preference. The place could use a bit of ethnic music but otherwise a great place with yummy food!

Just ate dinner at Colibri yesterday upon recommendation from our hotel concierge. It was underwhelming. We ordered the guacamole, cheese dip, and salsa trio dips for appetizers. All were good, but nothing special. For entrees we ordered the fish tacos, stuffed chicken, ceviche and stuffed pepper. Again, good but nothing special. The corn tortillas were very good but I wish the chips were warm. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice but bathrooms could be a little cleaner and nicer.

We all had carnitas and it was the icing on the cake!!! OMG! Delicious! A must have. Next visit we had fillet Mignon and bacon wrapped shrimp dishes both very good. The kids did carnitas again. We were able to walk from the Hilton Union Square. About a block or so...go!

I was very excited to try this restaurant. The food is authentic Mexican and I found it to be average. Perhaps it was due to the fact that we were seated near the prep kitchen and there was a lot of clanging of dishes. The place was loud as well. We ordered, fish tacos, empanadas and tostadas which were of a smaller portion. I also thought that our meal was overpriced for what we received.

Stopped in and were able to get a table without a reservation however it is a small-ish space so call ahead to reserve a table if you can and if you have a big group. We were on vacation with our two sons so they had to put some tables together to accommodate us.The staff was very friendly. We only saw two waiters trying to assist the entire restaurant so attentiveness was a bit slow. The food had great flavors!! Very authentic and reminded me of my grandmothers cooking..we would eat here again if in town and if it were just adults....However, if you have picky kids or are looking for a lot of food, this isn't the place. The menu is specific and small so there isn't a lot of choices for those who may want something else or kids who aren't used to small portions of different kinds of foods.

Looking for a restaurant near our hotel, later than expected - able to get seated on 30 minutes notice. Excellent service from the very start, and each dish was exquisitely seasoned and perfectly prepared. A signature Mole Poblano was wonderful, with very fresh and moist white meat chicken. A nightly special was a Carne Asada regional speciality which included Filete Mignon, also perfectly prepared. A side of Carnaval Corn in the Cob was a delicious variant on a simple side. Desserts were wonderful too, several with a La Leche ice cream. Overall, and excellent authentic Mexican meal with terrific service!

Took a small group (8) for a business dinner and had a very good experience. The prices are a little high and it's a little loud in this small restaurant, but the quality of food was high and the service was excellent. This isn't chipotle or taco bell, the selection of items on the menu is high-end mexican fare. I wish they had a few more "traditional" items you find at most restaurants but can't argue with the quality of what they served. Definitely get the guacamole, it's solid. Overall a very good experience, albeit a little pricey.

On a recent visit to San Fran, we picked this restaurant for dinner with family visiting from overseas. We had made a booking beforehand but no one seemed to care about that when we arrived. From the moment we entered and were greeted (or not) by the hostess, the restaurant disappointed us completely. The waiters are Grumpy and just wanted to make us order more, without caring to understand what we wanted. The poor service continued with the way the food was served, just handed to us to pass on the corner of the table. The food was bearable but the price was outrageous. The $26 Baja salmon was a big disappointment in both size and taste. We were tricked into buying two Guacamole orders, which were ridiculously small in quantity. The restaurant staff need to be Much better trained and taught to have proper attitude. When we got the bill, we were shocked to see that 20% TIPS was already charged! What a rip off?

This was the absolute BEST Mexican dinner we have ever had! The meal started with fresh masa corn tortillas for dipping into three salsas; mild, medium, and hot. We then ordered the Sopes as an appetizer which are truly not to be missed. Dinner consisted of Pechuga Rellena which were stuffed chicken breasts in a garlic cream sauce. We ordered rice and mushrooms as sides. Everything was cooked to perfection and spiced very well but not overly spicy. We had yummy desserts of Bananas Foster and Caballeros Pobres which is a tasty cinnamon pastry with a side of ice cream. The service and presentation were impeccable! Please do not miss this restaurant when visiting San Francisco! This was our favorite meal of all meals eaten while visiting!

Food was good, but not quite as good as other reviews have suggested. It was also quite pricey. Service was initially good, until we paid the bill, left a fair tip and were ready to leave.

Never experienced this before, and it would prevent us ever going here again.

Service was great, meal was tops; prices were a little over the top. I enjoyed the filet with spinach, mashed potatoes, stuffed chiles and chile mole as the vehicle which provided the kick. House staff was friendly and the place has nice atmosphere, though a little nosiy in the front room of the restaurant. I don't know what Mexican bistro food is, but I guess this is it. Basic standards of beef, fish, chicken, duck and lamb with a Mexican slant. Quality of the food seems to be high, just not sure that the prices $25 for an entree and $13 for the margarita of the month are warranted.

I am a native San Franciscan and ate here when a friend who visited wanted to go to a nice place that served Mexican food.I got a steak dish with beans and rice.The food was very average and absolutely unremarkable in any way. You can definitely get better Mexican food if you go into the Mission and eat at one of the many Taqueria's or even one of the more authentic Salvadorian or Nicaraguan restaurant.Those place will have florescent lighting and tables that rock back and forth, but the food is better and cheaper.I suspect is a place that does business by appealing to tourists that just don't know better, which is a shame because given all the great Central and South American food in the city. I'd like to think the place would want to do something special.They don't..just want to clean up on people's ignorance.And you can feel it, because the servers are pretty annoyed at the customers and seem to act like they would not be serving you...which given the gentrification and racism in this town. I get it. But sorry..it still makes for a place that is average in terms of food and unpleasant in terms of service.Not happy to write this..but this was my experience.

Expensive for what you get

The service was good, the food was ok, but not that special either. And above all very expensive for what it was (about 100$ for 2). Maybe I have a wrong idea of how expensive food is in San Fransisco?

A great spot to enjoy an authentic Mexican dish!

The family recipes are from Oaxaca nearby states. We tried the steak Tampiquena, Chile Relleno Pork, and the Pechuga Huitlacoche. All were delicious and well prepared. They have a great selection of Tequilas and Margaritas. A fun evening with full tummies!

Great Guacamole plus Good Food

Colibri is a small venue so you are in close proximity to other patrons. But, don't let that hold you back. The food is great. This is not your basic tacos etc, this is well thought out dishes in an old Mexican tradition (at least that's my interpretation). Easy walking distance to Union Square about two blocks. Prices are good and portions are generous but not over loaded. This place gets busy fast to early dinner is a good idea.

Not what we expected

If you're looking for that hole in the wall Mexican restaurant where the food is always sooo good, this isn't the place. It's more "fancy" Mexican food and did not include a lot of flavor. Service was so so. Worst of all.... NO chips and salsa!! 

Authentic and delicious Mexican cuisine in great surroundings.

We arrived without reservations on a busy Friday night and found the service from everyone very warm and efficient. The food was excellent, gourmet style and delicious like my Mexican family makes. The surroundings and atmosphere were typical Mexican, rustic and lovely. I have the same crockery at home! Loved it. 

Bad service and OK food

Our concierge at the hotel recommend the restaurant and we arrived without a reservation on Saturday evening, it was a very busy at the restaurant but we found a table for two and the three of us squeezed in since we were hungry and wanted to eat Mexican cuisine. We were glad that we made the choice, great guacamole, spicy was our choice along with lamb shank on a banana leaf. Good choice of dishes! Worth a visit while at Union Square! Highly recommended but do make a reservation. 

Awesome brunch!

Just finished a delicious brunch here. Great little restaurant, friendly staff and well priced. The only compliant is that I wanted everything on the menu and I won't have time to come back for dinner. Oh and they do bottomless mimosas...

No taste at all

Had the Quesadillas and the French Toast. The toast were OK, but the Quesadillas had no flavor at all. Absolutely nothing. And that's hard to do in a Mexican dish. I ate better at other Mexican restaurants here in San Francisco.

We went for dinner really late and yet, service was pleasant and attentive and the place welcoming and cozy. We had guac, chile con queso and quesadillas accompanied with a great margarita on the rocks. Great place!

Enjoyable dinner - great flavors

Had dinner with friends at Colibri in early May. Nice atmosphere and good service. We enjoyed the guacamole as an app. Flavorful, but not nearly enough spice. We sent it back once to make it spicier and it was still pretty mild when it came back. I think they seed jalapenos or seranos before adding to the guac. I had the Chili Relleno with cheese and enjoyed it. Great flavor. My friends had fish tacos and chicken mole and each enjoyed their dish. Overall an enjoyable meal. A bit pricey, but it is San Francisco.

So much more than typical Mexican fare

Great Mexican food, get the guac with tortillas. So fresh! Had Carnitas and Tortilla Soup, all very good and wish we could have had more. Try to make reservations, it fills up quickly.

Love this place. The Guacamole is a must eat....definitely enough for a few people. The tamarind shrimp are also very good!

Good dinner of traditional Mexican fare. Trendy spot but a bit loud and difficult to hear. Drinks a good addition to the meal.

Nice little tortilla appetizer

We made reservations using Opentable just to be sure, which was a good thing because they were rather busy when we went. Instead of the standard chips and salsa for a free appetizer, they had soft round tortillas with a few sauces of different spice levels. They were quite nice. For my entree I had the carnitas which was tasty. For dessert we shared the churros rellenos - it was enough for both of us and was very sweet. Service was pretty good. The food was a bit overpriced though not horribly so.

Good food, Nice atmosphere but a little expensive

This place is conveniently located in Union Square. It's dimly lit and has a nice atmosphere. We had the two chicken dishes and added the one of the sides (mixed corn, zucchini, cilantro: I can't remember the name). Food was quite good but the portions are quite small. The chicken breasts we got were small and didn't come with much else on the plate. 

Excellent!

Second visit to this restaurant. Enjoyed it as much as the first.Guacamole appetizer is fresh and very tasty. Mole Pablano was tender and very flavorful. My husband had the steak that was a special. He is very discerning about steak, and enjoyed it very much. Service was prompt and atmosphere was decorative. Can't wait for my next trip to San Francisco!

Wonderful Mexican food in the midst of Union Square

Our lunch at Colibri was a last minute decision, but we're so glad we stopped by. The food was excellent (great guacamole made to order, and came with chips, salsa, etc) and our main courses were excellent as well. Service was among the best we've experienced in the city .... our drinks were constantly refilled and our waiter checked back several times (without being intrusive).

Lovely authentic Mexican

This restaurant was close to our hotel and we had walked by several times. We were seated quickly and our waiter was very nice. The food was delicious and easily the best steak I've had on my trip to the US. The strawberry margarita I had was delicious.

Bar bites superb!

Ok, I hate cheesy Mexican decor - so this was a nice break from it. The guacamole with tortilla chips was good (not spicy enough, a bit bland), but very fresh. Great cocktails! For mains, the chicken in mole sauce was ok, the duck in green sauce actually quite tasty (if anything, slightly overlooked). Lively atmosphere, packed early in the evening. Reservations highly recommended!

My wife, daughter, and I had brunch at the Colibri Mexican Bistro on Sunday, December 11, 2016. We found this upscale Mexican restaurant to be amazing with great food, service, and atmosphere! We ordered Torrejas Colibri, Huevos benedictinos estilo Michoacan, and Chilaquiles verdes o rojos which were all awesome. Overall, a great dining experience! We highly recommend Colibri Mexican Bistro.

Overpriced and duck undercooked

We came here on a friday night and were sat at the bar as there was no space. Despite the good reviews our food came late and the duck was undercooked and full of fat. The creamy chicken was better but still overpriced. Good location and friendly service overall.
