Because there were lines practically out the door for tables. So glad we made a reservation. Had an absolutely delicious dinner bouncing around various parts of, and combinations of, Asia. Not a quiet spot by any means but the food is great - it's no surprise they've been in business for 20 years.

Stylish restaurant with noisy but fun atmosphere.Good food mostly pan asian with excellent variety and reasonable cost. We loved the prawn salad and Satay chicken. Their wood grilled burger is one of the very best we have ever eaten. Handy location on Sutter St not far from Union Square and they will deliver or you can have a take away if you want to eat in your local hotel which we did one night.Prices are sensible. Service is really friendly and we suggest you try some of their craft beers which are wonderful.Highly recommended restaurant.

Stopped in with client for a lunch while in SF. We ordered a couple apps and enjoyed both. We all enjoyed our meals. I had "Satay My Way" and opted for the 4 different styles/sauces of satay/skewers. Place wasn't too crowded, service was good, price was generally typical for SF. Good spot.

The hotel concierge sent us here when we decided on Asian for dinner. This is not disappoint. We had a terrific ceviche in a coconut after seeing it at another diner's table. Everything was fresh and well prepared. Even though there was quite a crowd in the place, it's set up to give you a feeling of privacy at plenty of the tables. Good choice.

The interior of this place is really great, but got VERY loud. I don't particularly like having to yell over the table to be heard so that was a real problem for me. Food was good, but felt like a more modern twist on Asian so don't go here if you're looking for authentic Asian cuisine. Service was prompt and friendly. Reservations can be helpful, especially on the weekend.

While visiting Chinatown in San Francisco, I checked my Trip Advisor app and found this exceptional restaurant for lunch. It is about 2 block from the Chinatown main gate. The decor is very urban. The service was outstanding and the food was great. We had a variety of appetizers to share that were tasty. The place also offered a fix price menu that was reasonably priced. We wanted more variety so went for multiple small places. This place was great and highly recommended.

Tasty food at a reasonable price with attentive service. There was a lot on the menu that I didn't understand as it wasn't necessarily food I'm overly familiar with (I've always stuck to chain restaurants when it's come to south east Asian food). Just go for it though and you won't be disappointed.Previous reviews have said the restaurant was loud, which it was, but that's the kind of place it is. It has a 'buzz' rather than a candlelit romantic feel. Not a bad thing, just different.

Liked the decor too! Forgetting the name of our server but she was great too!

First time at E&O, booked it after reading great reviews on various sites. Those reviewers were right, this is an excellent place for great food. Never really liked the term 'Asian Fusion' for menu style, but it is probably best way to describe the extensive and eclectic choice on offer here. Really hard to chose, everything sounded good and (from a peak at everyone else's plates) everything looks good too. Chose the Pad Thai and was delighted. Book it and enjoy it.

Loud and overpriced

I dropped into E&O for dinner after a business meeting and since it was near my hotel. The place was very busy (around 8:30) and extremely loud. I ordered the fried calamari (about $15) which was rendered tasteless by the heavy breading which coated the very small pieces of calamari. I also had an order of the chicken spring rolls which were somewhat better but pretty mediocre in light of the high cost for 4 spring rolls. The food did arrive from the kitchen quickly, and apparently they bring out whatever is ready at the time since the dished came at different times. Overpriced and mediocre food. Will not return.

I would have rated this place better as the food was actually quite tasty, though very small for what it is, but when the bill arrived we noticed an additional charge for "sf employer mandates" for $1.19. I know that isn't much, but this restaurant apparently would rather charge a random (hidden) fee on top of food and tax to pay for their employees health insurance instead of treating their employees right and covering it themselves. Before I saw this fee, I would have come back even though I felt it pricy for what it is, but after that they've lost my future business. Hidden fees don't belong anywhere, especially on restaurants.

We came here on a Saturday night. We reserved a table online the day before. This restaurant is quite big, good for large groups/birthday parties etc. Service was excellent. Lots to choose from the menu. We got the Indonesian Corn Fritters (very tasty, the sauce was awesome), Indonesian Fried Rice and Pad Thai. Fried rice was my favourite, the seasoning was on point. I think the pad thai was just okay, I feel that it didn't have enough flavours. The pricing was reasonable, quality of food was good and the wait time for the food wasn't too bad. Overall, I had a good experience here and I would come back and try other dishes.

We were recommended to try this restaurant by discerning friends who were so impressed they ate here twice while visiting San Fran. We were glad that we came.We had a big bowl of chargrilled edamame beans with rock salt and pepper to share as an entree. There were too many of them and although delicious we had to leave so many! For main we had the char sui cod on steamed greens (delish) and the very interesting burger concoction with a 'bun' made from the signature e&o corn fritter, served with kim chi vegetables. Both were really very good. I would recommend this place as a quality eating establishment in a central location just a stroll from Union Square.

On the border of Chinatown, this modern take on Asian cuisine made all four of us happy, including two kids.The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. The selections were quite varied across Asian cultures, and each dish was wonderful.The edamame was nicely seasoned. The beer selection was nice with some local micro brews as well as traditional beers. The tuna app was excellent with intricate flavors that did not obscure the tuna itself. The noodle dishes were nicely done and enjoyed by all. The price was a bit high but not atypical for a downtown San Francisco restaurant. Overall, a really nice family meal in a pleasant setting.

This place was top notch. I was traveling solo and both the bar and two tops were full, the wonderfully welcoming hostess asked if I would like to be seated at the chefs table, curious, I said sure, this is a little bar area, with three stools overlooking the kitchen & it was amazing. It was like watching a culinary orchestra. The chefs are incredibly passionate about the food they put out and you can tell by the way they handle orders from start to finish. And the plating of food is done with precision. Hostess, wait staff, and the chef and line cooks were all very friendly and made me feel like family hanging out in their kitchenTop shelf people here.

I usually steer well clear of anything labelled "Asian Fusion." This place was within our walking and we had nowhere else to start so we started here.They do a take on all sorts of Asian food - Indian (we had lamb naan), Thai (we had pad thai), Korean (we had pork and kimchi dumplings) - and a variety of other cultures. While I loved all the small plates and dumplings that we ordered, I found the pad thai soggy and lacking flavour. Definitely make a reservation if you're planning on coming here. We came at 8pm on a Thursday night and lucked out with space for the three of us at a communal table. They will also serve you in the lounge area (but I would say it makes for difficult eating).

My husband and I love all types of Asian food, and live in Houston where there is plenty of authentic Asian Food so we are tough to please. I gave this 5 stars because the entire experience was great, including the food. I have been to many Michelin and 5 star places with bad service but great food. This is Asian Fusion, so expect a variety of Asian flavors and options. We also ate a several other authentic Asian places while in SF, but here we knew what to expect. We had the Mushroom Dumplings and the Indonesian Fried Rice per the Chef's recommendation. We were not disappointed by either, and the dumplings were truly outstanding. We also got the Green Papaya Salad (always one of my favorite dishes so I love to try each places version) and the Coconut Ceviche. These were both great and we would order all of the dishes all over again. We wish could have ordered more, but this was more than we could finish! The cocktails were good, as were cookies at the end of the meal. The Chef happened to be at the hostess stand when we checked in for our reservation and she personally sat us. She also gave us a few of her favorite dishes, and delivered them to our table once we had ordered. At the end we were so full, we did not opt for dessert but she brought us a few cookies on the house anyhow. She was kind and spent time speaking with us, which always makes an good experience better!

We felt like some Asian food and picked this one on the rating. Number 64 of over 4500 restaurants in San Francisco. So we had some expectations. The reception by the headwaiter was impersonal at best. The choice of food is quite limited. The quality is ok. Prices are in the upper range considering quantity. The place is nice. Staff is friendly. Speed of serving food not inline with speed of serving drinks. So not bad but definitely not in line with its top rank. So if they want to celebrate their next 20 years, do something.

Very nice casual place - lots of wood, high ceilings, well lit and plenty of seating. An Asian theme and feel without going overboard. 5 For dinner. Seated quickly but in the main bar area. Which was OK except our table was in the traffic flow and lower then the table next to us - kinda felt like I was eating in a pit. But a well thought out menu with plenty Asian options to pick from. Two Satays - one chicken, one steak. One Shaking Beef. One Pad Thai (why do I even bother to look at the menu....) Just the right size portions, served fast. Even enough to share a few tastes among the gang.And the 5th Star - Missed because of my ultimate pet peeve - THE TEA BAG. Ordered green tea - get the bag and a small pot of water. If you are going to be an Asian restaurant - have the Asian tea brewer and pour from there. DO NOT bring me a tea bag from the grocery store. Well staffed, courteous and efficient. Good suggestions, knowledgeable not only on the food choices but the beverage choices as well.You want 5 stars - No Teabag

I wanted a mussel dish but they had run out after I had placed my order. I was so disappointed.

It was just my husband and I and we weren't super hungry so we skipped the main courses and opted for a number of appetizers and salad and shared.

We enjoyed a great evening with friends at this high quality restaurant, which is just a few yards away from the SF Chinatown entrance gate. It's near Chinatown, but it's not just Chinese food on offer, as this venue provides choices from other Asian countries, including Thailand and India. The range of food options is extensive and the opportunity to mix them up is something we've never experienced before, and the range of flavours this creates is simply wonderful. Wine and cocktail choices were also very good, as was the speed, charm and quality of the service. That said, please be aware that all this certainly doesn't come cheap, and this is easily the most expensive restaurant we've visited on our California road trip. Overall though, a visit here is highly recommended.

I was here with a group for a business dinner.I asked for a gluten free menu, which took about 30 minutes to get. I was able to eat some of the other items we ordered as appetizers because they were simple and I could tell no gluten was present (they were free of soy sauce too). Once everyone at my table was done eating, they finally stopped to ask me if I wanted to order anything. I realized that I could have just asked if I could order, but I was caught up in conversation and was just annoyed at the limited gluten free menu once I finally got it.  A meh in my book.

I went to E & O Kitchen for the first time with some friends for Dining out of Life. Some of us arrived early, sat in the bar during happy hour and had appetizers, including chicken satay, mushroom satay and corn fritters, which were all very good. I only eat vegetarian, but my friends enjoyed the meat. For dinner we ordered small plates including the BOP, green beans, cauliflower, and panir naan. I believe there was some meat dishes as well, but I can't speak to those, but everything else was quite delicious. I'd definitely go back for dinner or just for happy hour!

Was here in Oct 2007, then again in Sept 2016 and now in April 2017. Boy, has service gone down! The corn fritters haven't changed (a good thing) but the rush to service is unnecessary and I spent $28 on a beef dish that didn't arrive until moments before the check came and I only had one slice of it when I got back to the hotel. Find another restaurant if you're on the fence of the E&O Kitchen and Bar; trust me, it'll be better than this place. 

Have the Decency to Call

I realize there was a power outage yesterday morning in the city, but come on! We had dinner reservations to dine there last evening and walked about 10 blocks to get there. When we arrived there was a note on the door stating they were closed for the evening and would reopen the next day. In the 10 min we stood there looking for another restaurant to dine at without reservations on a Friday evening five other parties with reservations arrived only to find out they too were SOL.Please have the decency to call those individuals with reservations as soon as humanly possible if you are going to be closed so they can make other arrangements.

The tip to go there and to find a wide and vast variety of pan-Asian dishes ... quite disappointing what we found , mediocre quality and not the nicest restaurant... weak drinks card included ...

Great south east Asia sample

Me and my friend shared a two course dinner for lunch as suggested on the menu. The food was tasty and nice. We had the butternut squash dumplings and satay your way. But to be honest there was not quite enough food. It is good idea to encourage sharing, but then the portions also be in a size so they can be shared.

I only visit Jakarta for this amazing creation of a dessert. Whoever created is kudos to you. Amazing service & great food. Love their passion fruit mojito. Crunchy caramelised chicken starter was very appetising and a notch above anything that I have eaten. 

Just wonderful

We are visiting the city over spring break. We had pumpkin/squash dumplings, egg rolls, corn fritters, steak dish, tuna tartare, and chop suey noodles with chicken. Very mixed feeling on these. The best were tuna tartare, the steak and the squash dumpling. But on the opposite the egg rolls were very inedible just terrible tasting chicken inside and very thick wrapper that was chewy. In addition the chicken in the chop suey noodle dish was also very bad tasting we had to leave all the chicken and just eat the noodles. The corn fritters were greasy and weren't served hot. Very busy restaurant and very nice wait staff. But I wanted the food to be better than it was.

Went on reviews from TripAdvisor & we were surprised at how nice it is & popular, we had to wait for about 20 mins for a table but able to sit at the bar to wait. We had corn fritters, lamb naan & steelhead (salmon) all very nice & reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere.

A very busy place to get a table but great food. A bit noisy at night. They have an interesting menu for those who like this style of food. Worth a trey. Make sure you make a reservation...

Outstanding Happy Hour Dinner

E&O was terrific for a Happy Hour early dinner. There were ample food selections, ranging between $1 and $4. Each was fresh, absolutely delicious, from ahi tartare in a tiny crispy bowl with a hint of sesame, to succulent portobello satay, to naan with a tomato chutney and alternate yogurt sauce. The corn fritters were a standout with succulent kernels gently battered, crispy fried, and served with a piquant dip. Squash dumpling were set off by a velvet curry sauce; beef sliders could have been a meal in themselves, with crunchy taro slivers. Service was very attentive and friendly, the ambiance relaxing, the decor stunning.

Every dish was delish!

Ordered four smalls and noodles to share with wife. The chicken lettuce cups and tamarind ribs were beautifully flavored and the potstickers and spring rolls lovely. Chow me in noodles had huge amounts of chicken pieces and a great mix of mushrooms. Service was great. Couldn't fault the experience.

We came on a recommendation from our hotel and it was great. The skewers were delicious and so were the short rib sliders. Great ambiance and the Moscow mule was great!

Great and I mean that... Food. Wonderful to share and try different dishes. Was full so not the best for a quiet business discussion but everything was fine and I would go back. Apparently you need to book

We tried three small items that were good but certainly not close to the best we have ever had. Our neighborhood take out place has better dumplings. The shrimp skewers were fine. It was very pricey for what you got. We thought we would try this place based on the reviews here.

E & O is a definitely a hot-spot with locals who know they have excellent food, well presented in a pleasantly busy and hip atmosphere. Seating can be tight due to the crowds and we were glad we made a reservation- no waiting. The signature corn fritters are a "must have" and we couldn't get enough of the Indonesian Fried Rice. Everything we ate was delicious and fresh and service and execution is quick.

If you love Asian food, definitely eat here. The mushroom dumplings are amazing! Everything else was, too! Some of the best Asian food I've had in a very, very long time. The restaurant itself is warm, contemporary and very inviting.

Our family loved this restaurant. Have to try the prawn salad, best seafood salad we've ever had. It was very light with lemongrass, Thai basil, lychee, mango and more. The potstickers, pad Thai, and tuna tartare were delicious. 

Best Oysters at happy hour and that Corn Fritter OH MY!

My husband and I checked out this restaurant while in San Francisco for the night. Reviews mention the corn fritters. Don't pass on these. They were amazing with delicious dipping sauce. The chicken satay with vegetables also worth a try. Chow mein noodles another great dish. All could be shared. Great vibe, nice decor. Attentive and knowledgeable wait staff. 

Not condimented enough for my taste

We have ordered quite a lot of things:Vegetarian dumplings, pad Thai, eggplant with tofu, shrimp satee and match cakeI'm really sorry, but I wasn't impressed with any of the dishes. Asked for some more flavouring and got soy sauce.Obviously when you salt food it becomes tastier but I wouldn't want to hide the flavours to achieve that.On top of that we had an unfortunate incident when the waiter mixed up the credit card and instead of splitting the bill charged the same card twice.

Really tasty food, good service

We popped in here late in the evening as we were all over the place from jet lag, the staff were very helpful even though the kitchen was closing soon, We all ordered small enough dishes but the plates were all cleared, I wish I had gone back to try other items from the menu
