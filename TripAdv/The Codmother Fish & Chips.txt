Best Fish and Chips this side of London
Rating: 5
Date: October 26, 2017
Best fish and chips I've had this side of my favorite place in London (see my review of London Fish and Chips).Located just off of Fisherman's Wharf, this semi-permanently located food truck serves up some great fish and chips.For $11, you get two large pieces of fish and chips (fries). The secret seems to be that they use fresh fish and make the fish to order. When you get the fish it is hot and the batter and fish are delicious.They only serve drinks in bottles or cans, by the way.You do eat at picnic tables outside under awnings. Nothing fancy, just good food.We ate here twice and both times delivered. Price and quality were excellent.

This place had good reviews on trip advisor and in the guide book we had so we tried it.It only does fish and chips but both were very nice,i would use this place again.It is not easy to spot we missed it first time around and only spotted it the next day ,if you turn off Jefferson street heading south you will find it on the corner of the next road =Beach street,if you walk past a pizza place called Carmel your heading the right direction ,staff were nice and friendly as well.One thing to consider it is undercover but outside.Nice place.

Authentic fish and chips served al fresco.

After reading TA reviews before we arrived, this place planned for our last meal before leaving for the airport as it was close to our hotel & being a food truck we knew it wouldn't take long! It was quite busy, but we did manage to find somewhere to sit, the wait was about 10 mins from ordering.We all had the Fish & Chips, cost was $11 a portion. The fish was very nice & you got 2 decent size pieces. The chips were a little dry & there could've been a few more, but overall it was a decent lunch.

It's tucked away down a side street and we almost walked by. We had fish and chips and shrimp,and chips. Both tasted lovely and fresh. You sit outside on benches so if you're expecting a restaurant you will be disappointed. The chips were real not out of a freezer bag. Good value, tasty and a few dollars less than the main street.

I read about this place, "The Codmother Fish % Chips" online...and while we walked around San Francisco's fisherman's wharf area we walked right by it! So, yes, we HAD to stop. I was somewhat taken back because it was more of a food truck with outdoor seating but hey, the reviews were good so, we ordered. What we received was....wait for it.....wait for it.....THE BEST FISH AND CHIPS EVER! The batter was crisp and the fish was moist. Not the smashed down, small, cold and mushy fish and chips of many places but tender, flaky, with just the right batter. Do not pass this place by!

This is an outside/food truck cafe. There are a few tables but seating is limited. The fish and chips were perfect. Cooked while you wait; fresh and tastey. No restroom that I saw but they do offer hand sanitizer. Keep in mind you're at the wharf. Price wasn't bad. A little windy so hold onto your napkins. A roll of paper towels on a holder on each table would be great. Drinks are in cans so no refills. A little hard to find. I couldn't see it from the main road. Would definitely recommend.

I don't know if we're Fish and Chip snobs, or just unlucky, but for us this was one of the worst fish and chip experiences we've had anywhere in the world.To start with the sauce, we think it was meant to be tartare sauce, I'm not sure.The chips: soggyThe fish: plenty of batter, not much fish, when we broke a piece in half a lot of unknown liquid came out.The prawns: probably the 'highlight' but still not great.We won't be back. Judging by other reviews I'm guessing this places main problem is consistency.

After hearing about this place and seeing the review on trip adviser we had no choice but to test the food from this food truck. We had the fish and chips and it was honestly a let down.

We went there with high expectations and with the queue and long wait I thought they must be right. When the food arrived I realized I was wrong. The chips were in fact some of the worst I have ever eaten, or attempted to eat as most of them went in the bin. I dont know what happened there but my bet is they used the wrong potato or it was a bad batch. The batter on the fish was ok, but the fish overcooked.

Our family was in California for 12 days and visited many places - and The Codmother was one of our favorite meals. As you can see if you are reading this, it has received such high praise on TA that I added it as a must-eat on our itinerary and was so happy I did. The fish and chips are amazing, cooked perfectly, crispy and tasty. That said, it was everything else as well: the owner was taking orders from the window and was extremely friendly and helpful; the picnic-table outside seating on a lovely, clear, warm night in San Francisco was comfortable and relaxing; all of the guests were happy to be there because they were eating great food - so the mood and atmosphere are peaceful. And for dessert, there are fried Oreos, what more can be said. :)

Food truck near Fisherman's Wharf. I had to ask for directions since I couldn't find and it is hidden away. I had seen the Codmother in a tour book and decided to stop here for a quick lunch. There are picnic tables to eat at, but be prepared since it is a busy place and you may have to either share a table or wait till space opens up. Fresh fish is used in the fish and chips not frozen. Inexpensive find in such a touristy location of San Francisco. Was pleased with my fish & chips, not greasy. Staff was friendly and provided quick service once order was placed.

Food truck style service with picnic tables to eat at. There are many restaurants in the area that serve fish and chips. This place is much cheaper and probably better tasting than most.

Drinks are cans and a couple bucks each.

This place has some good fish and chips and the prices were really reasonable. For a two piece fish and chips, I think it was all of $10 or $11. Not bad considering where I come from, I pay around $15 for a two piece fish and chips. The seating is all outdoor and mostly has umbrellas, but if you are unlucky enough to get a seat without an umbrella and it is a warm day, make sure you wear sunscreen. Make sure you go right before the peak time otherwise you'll have a little wait.

I had checked out tripadvisor before our trip to San Franciso, and The Codmother was on my list. It did not disappoint. We had the fish and chips and the shrimp and chips, both were excellent! Make sure you know where is it, because it it pretty tricky to find. The staff was very friendly. Worth a stop!

Expected more variety

I get that its just a fish and chip truck but with a very high rating, I expected a little more than just one type of fish and one type of batter. Perhaps this review is a case of expectations being too high because of its TA rating. That being said, the fish they served was fresh and tasty. I didnt think the chips were that great but the meal was pleasant overall and service was relatively fast for the amount of people waiting.

Friendly place.....

....and the fish is really fresh and delicious. The owner is amazing with her patrons and her setup is simple and works.A must visit for anyone visiting San Francisco The baja fish tacos are not too bad eitherWe ordered a large fish and chips and 2 fish tacos and 2 sodas and the bill was $22. Not bad for a fresh, tasty lunchLovely experience and we will definitely be back next time we are in San Francisco.

Loved the food the fish tacos were yummy. The staff was very nice and helpful, enjoyed the outdoor area. This is a great little gem. We will be visiting SF in a few weeks and will definitely eat there again.

Delicious fish &amp; chips!

My husband and I got the fish and chips and the fish tacos. Both were excellent! The fish tacos have so much fish on them that initially it was hard to eat them. But after eating about half the fish off each taco, they were a little more manageable. Definitely a good little spot to stop for lunch! 

Amazing breading, friendly staff

Our guide on a Segway tour recommended this place. I'm glad we listened. The fish and chips are dynamite. The junior portion was plenty for me (1 large fish and fries.) The fried oreos were yummy.

Cutest, Artsy Eatery

This place (food truck) is a very cute and quaint outdoor eatery close to Fisherman's Wharf. The Cod and Shrimp are very fresh and fried to perfection! It melts in your mouth. I will definitely return. The owners/workers are very friendly and courteous. It's just a very clean, cutesy, artsy little outdoor eatery with benches to eat on. Don't be fooled by the fact your food is being prepared from an artsy mobile truck. I give this place ten stars! Get your eat on!!! Go for it! You will not regret it. 

Super Fresh Fish &amp; Friendly Staff
