Great restaurant in a dangerous location

We have been going to the Cliff House for over 20 years and have always enjoyed the food, service, & views. During our most recent visit someone broke into several cars that were parked near the restaurant. Very unsafe location that needs to be addressed before we go back. Glass everywhere, many customer phone calls to the police with no action!!! If you go do not drive yourself or park your car near the restaurant or valet your car, it will be damaged or broken into day or night. Consider using Uber as your have a high likelihood of your car being broken into or being damaged. Unfortunately this is a great restaurant in a very bad location.

Delicious Breakfast with an amazing view.

My husband and I ate breakfast at the Cliff House and enjoyed every minute of it. I got the Farmer's Scrambler and it was tasty. Their fameous popovers are a showstopper but that view is the scene stealer. Daniel was our server and he was great; very attentive and so friendly. The Cliff House made our San Francisco trip so much better.

Booked dinner via concierge at out hotel and were given a much sought after window seat. The food, wine and service were all awesome. Watching the sunset was a magical experience and once the sun had gone we were able to give our full attention to the food!

The open faced crab sandwich was excellent, although it had a bit too much (easily removed) cheese. The salad and popovers were also good. But the food is really secondary to the view...we requested a window table and had a short 20 minutes which we used to prowl the gift shop (said gift shop was overpriced, but then they all are). We were fortunate to have a clear, sunny day, so when we finally got to our table the view of the rocks and ocean was stellar. Service was fast and the server was attentive. All in all, a very nice experience.

We visited San Francisco just for the day while in northern California for our National Park vacation. We wanted to eat seafood and after picnicking for the week, we wanted to splurge on a very nice meal. This was the perfect choice for us. We ate early on Friday afternoon so it wasn't crowded and we didn't have to have a reservation. We had a table next to the window to enjoy the sunset over the ocean and could watch the ships come in and out of the bay. Our waiter was very courteous and attentive. Our specialty drinks were very tasty and the food was marvelous!! And we even splurged on a dessert that was to die for! Sure, there are many choices in this big city but we were very pleased with this choice!!

Originally this was a stop over for a few quick photo ops because of the magnificent scenery. Then as our second destination was a bust, so we returned here.We were in the downstairs restaurant which had the magnificent views. The food, though pricey, was well presented. I had the crab sandwich, which was a bit dry and tasteless and my friend the Thai seafood mix which he loved.The only downer was the long wait on hold to make a booking - close to 10 minutes.

My family and I recently went to the Cliff House Bistro for dinner. They do not take reservations for the Bistro but we only waited 10 minutes to be seated. Our table was next to the window with a fabulous view of the beach and ocean. The sun was setting as we arrived which made it even more special. My husband ordered the pork chop which is bone-in accompanied by a cornbread stuffing. I don't think there was a crumb left on his plate. I ordered the Cioppino which was filled with mussels, crab and shrimp, delicious. The service was fast and friendly. If you want to eat somewhere with an outstanding view and great service this is your place.

This world-class city we call San Francisco is essentially a thumbnail (peninsula) sticking its thumb into a strategic bay of the Pacific Coast.But for a city surrounded by sea water San Francisco shockingly few A++ restaurants right on the water -- specifically on the Pacific shoreline. (As opposed to the inland Bay).In fact, there is only one A ++ restaurant in San Francisco on the Pacific shoreline: The Cliff House.A beautifully-restored venue with Ocean Beach to the south (San Francisco's much colder, and poorer, version of Miami's South Beach)And to the north, San Francisco's ruins that remind me of the Baths of Caracalla in Rome.

BEST !!! Views of any Restaurant in San Francisco! Lunch or Early dinner is the best here for the views if you are eating after dark you are missing the best part of the meal. The food is typical seafood and steaks and other selections that taste great and is somewhat pricey but if you are going to spend the money to eat here you might as well enjoy the view and any ships that are coming into the Bay. They pass right in front of the Cliff House before heading under the Golden Gate Bridge.

My husband and I made dinner reservations for ourselves and another couple at Sutro's at the Cliff House. Our dinners were very good, but expensive by our standards. The average meal is around $50 plus drinks, dessert, appetizer.....The view was priceless. The restaurant has large windows that face the west so every table has a great(blinding)view of the sunset. They have shades on the windows and raise them just before sunset. The staff was wonderful, friendly and attentive. It was a very special evening.

My wife and I stopped in for lunch as we rode around on rental bikes on this day. Sadly, it was grey and very foggy. This did not deter from the experience, however. It seems there are 3 dining areas. As you enter you can enter the Bistro to the left, then there is a stair case that goes downstairs, and there is additional seating to the right - and that is where we ate. We were lucky and got a table of 2 right by the window. We had some calamari and a seafood chowder, as well as some wings. We would definitely return and come for dinner. Be prepared, as expected, prices are on the higher side.

Great breakfast yet pricey

We went on a Tuesday morning to try famous "Eggs San Francisco". These are something like eggs Benedict but with crab meat instead of Canadian bacon, sourdough bread on the bottom and a brandy creme sauce instead of Hollandaise. While at about $20 this is the highest price breakfast I have ever ordered but It was indeed wonderfully tasty. It was also more than you can eat with a huge amount of crab and served with fried small potatoes halves and fresh fruit (cut melons, with one large strawberry) but if that was not enough to make you ask for a box for leftovers, it was also served with 2 of their famous turnovers, a puffy bread that looks like a muffin but is much lighter and delicious with butter and marmalade (4 for the two of us). We  each ordered this, their feature of the house egg dish, but one order might have been enough for two to share. We got a take out box for about half of the potatoes and melons along with two of the turnovers and finishing there at 11 am we were still stuffed until dinner. Just a lot of food and rich beside. We shared a bloody Mary for fun (which at $11 was pricey as well). Of course the view of seal rocks and the pacific ocean makes the high prices likely worth it for a rare treat and since we were on vacation and not likely to get back to San Francisco for years to come, it was a tourist sort of experience that we enjoyed fully. Worth every cent. Note that the crab meat is plentiful, almost too much (if that is possible) but we found a number of pieces of crab shell (or my tongue and teeth did) in the crab meat so eat it carefully as you might eating carefully for bones in fish. And the service was wonderful, with friendly servers and staff that told us about the history there and more. We really enjoyed it. We were able to park on the street just a hundred feet from the entrance but there is a small lot just up the hill a bit to the north that would be easy to walk from (and back up to- uphill but not too far).

Food would probably only rate a 3 but it's gets the 4 for the view. Worth the trip.

Worst food. My husband ordered the halibut and it was hard as a rock. We told the waitress and she asked if he needed sauce I ordered Caesar salad and it came out really cold like it had been prepared early in the day and stuck in the ice box. My friend ordered the tuna tartare and asked for soy sauce and the waitress said it would take forever to find but she brought her some type of oil that was awful and not what you would want to put on tuna. This is a place to go have a drink but go eat somewhere else. Bad food nothing we ordered was any good.

Sunday without the buffet

We made reservations for 6 on a Sunday -- but in the lower level of the restaurant, not the elaborate Sunday buffet or the walk-in-friendly upstairs. Food and drinks (try the Ramos gin fizz!) very good, service fantastic. But if you are craving the famous Cliff House popovers, you can't get them in this part of the restaurant (only for walk-in and buffet section). Executive chef says they make 2,000 a day, 200 at a time. We met him because he happened to be nearby when we asked about the history of the place -- and he regaled us with tales while offering a tour. So: I'm giving this place 5 stars because the experience was unforgettable. Oh: and our table was in a corner with views to die for.

Unbelievably good.

Three of us lunched there yesterday. Mushroom risotto, crab cakes, steak-frites were what we had. Each rated their dish excellent. I had the steak which came with a perfect sauce. The meat was just the cut you would get in Paris. A little chewy, but it is supposed to be. Though the portions were filling, we could not resist dessert. Those were excellent too. Our server was first-rate. Always there when you needed him, but did not hover or chitchat. Of course, when we praised the food, he said the crabcakes and steak-frites were the most popular things on the menu.A famous tourist attraction that actually serves great food! I've been a couple of times before, and the food was good then, but is outstanding today.

With most of San Francisco Bay sweltering on this early September day, my brother and wife ventured to Sutro's at the Cliff House, partly to enjoy the view, partly to see some history, and partly to eat a delicious meal. We were not disappointed with any part of the visit. Eating a scrumptious lunch while gazing at the Pacific Ocean made the day all the more enjoyable. Our group ate mostly appetizers, all of which were wonderful. Of particular note was the Ahi Tuna Tartre and the half Dozen Oysters appetizers. We also split Dungenous Crab Cakes and a Dungenous Crab Louis. Best of all tastings was the Anchor Steam Braised Mussels with Harrisa. Served with grilled herb focaccia (great for dipping in broth), it was perfectly sweet and peppery. Wonderful way to end the meal. I would return just to try that dish again. Kristoff, our server took great care of us. Overall worth a return visit to this historic restaurant.

First the pop overs are excellent. Could not stop eating them with fresh creamy butter. My bacon, cheddar and mushroom omelet was perfectly cooked with nice thick smoked bacon (large chunks). Loaded with ingredients. Nicely seasoned potatoes. Wife's SF spin on eggs Benedict was equally awesome. Eggs were perfectly poached. Brandy sauce very flavorful and lump crab instead of Canadian bacon. Yum. Attentive knowledgeable service. Reasonable prices.

Lunch at the Cliff House is a delightful experience, especially during the week when the crowds are less. If going on a Saturday or Sunday, take a cab or check on the Geary Street bus, which is a pleasant ride from downtown. I didn't heed my own advice last Sunday, and after I dropped my passenger off I searched for parking for nearly half an hour before parking nearly a mile away. The food and setting , however, make this all worthwhile. The building itself is a modern remodel, but the interior features many photos of bygone San Francisco. The first floor features a bar and casual dining. Sutro's is the formal dining room on the lower level with wide sea views. This is a special place.

A magical breakfast on my first visit to San Francisco. We sat by the wraparound windows watching the Pacific surf come in and were amazed to see a pod of about 5 dolphins playing in the surf right in front of us near the beach at the foot of the cliff. No seals on Seal Rock but pelicans flying over. Great food and great history to the building. Worth the long drive from downtown. Would definitely go there again.

The Cliff House sits on a cliff facing west and offers great view of the Pacific Ocean. While we have lunch there, a whale can be seen flapping its tail fin in and out of the water in the distance. The view of the California coastline is also spectacular. For appetizer, I had the Dungeness Crab Cake. The skin was crunchy and it was very tasty with lots of crab meat inside. For the main dish I had the Two Crab Sandwich. The sandwich had dungeness crab salad with fried soft shell crab. It was very interesting and tasty. The waiter was very attentive and the service was prompt. They even brought out a special dessert with two egg shells filled with butterscotch and whipped cream with the word "Anniversary" written in chocolate sauce on the plate (since it was our anniversary). All in all, a very satisfying dining experience. Highly recommended.

First things first.... Our view was incredible from our table situated on a glass 'corner', where you could see many different views and landmarks - we could not have asked for a better view, other than it being a foggy day... So, on to the food - it was simply an outstanding experience. We had 5 different people at the table and thus an array of different items. The seafood was buttery and wonderful, skirt steaks were done to perfection, and even the deserts were tremendous. The only thing that fell a bit short were the Bloody Mary's we ordered, they could have had a more robust flavor and kick - they were just flat. The service was good, as expected and everything was worth the effort to get there. Next time we are near there, we will definitely stop in again for a visit.

We ordered the sourdough french toast and the Johnson Omelette. My husband loved the omelette, which was FULL of crab and avocado.

We wanted to get away from the insane steep hills of downtown San Fran and this is about as far west as ou can go and still be in San Fran. Really glad we did, the view is out of this world high on a cliff (obviously) watching the big ships come out of the bay and enjoying great wine and a good menu. I was a little troubled by the reports of car break ins and they actually have signs warning that it is an area of high petty crime. The police or management need to get those signs down and bring the break ins under control, simply putting warning signs up makes it look like the bad guys are in charge of the parking areas and the good guys have lost. trying to enjoy dinner while wondering if your car is being broken into takes a lot away from what is a really well restored building, with great charm and decor.

Our food was good, halibut and French onion soup served with fantastic sour dough bread. Our waiter was friendly and efficient.

We brought our own 2009 spring mountain ellivette and he made us feel special for only a $25 corkage fee. Although a bit pricey, it is in San Francisco, the meals were special. I had the lamb chops served with Yukon gold potatoes. My wife had the pork chop, my daughter had the scallops and my son enjoyed the 14 oz steak. All meals were enjoyed and I tasted all except the scallops. Great deserts and good cappuccino topped the evening. They even brought a special birthday treat and sang for my son.

A legendary coastal dining experience for this sensational location, excellent food and service. Worth the top dollar if you eat early to enjoy the sunset views of whales, seals, birds and crashing waves - and shipping. You'll need sunnies and I was pleased we remembered the binoculars. Book early to get a window seat. It's ok to be further back as everywhere table sees the view.To really appreciate the coastal history Uber to the USS San Francisco warship memorial around the headland a stroll for a 45 minutes to Cliff House after views of the bridge, shipping, baths ruin and waves in rugged rocks.You'll be sure to consume three courses.Well worth the $120 per head.

Standing alone overlooking the seal rock and the remnants of the baths is this restaurant with wide windows and amazing views. The pictures on the walls take us back into time when the building housed the baths and was a place for entertainment. Tickets sold, old menus, pictures of men and women diving into the baths,posters of diving contests all take you back in time.The food was good. The lamb sandwich turned out to be an open one and more than one person could finish. The cod was good. But the chicken turned out hard and below average. I would go again just for tghe view.The beach of course is not worth it. Course and dark it does not look attractive. The open air bath is dirty with loads of algae and needs a cleanup.

Arrived 30 minutes early for our dinner reservation, was told we were too early, and got seated half an hour later by the sarcastic smiling hostess. We requested for a window table but got one that was right next to a wall, affording us just a glimpse of the ocean amidst the heads of those by the window. LOL! Ironically, the splendid views drew us here. We had the salmon, tempura, and crab cakes; lamb chops, duck, and the halibut as mains. During the entire dinner, I just felt insanely guilty for insisting on this place to my husband. For the price you pay, of course you'd expect something for the books but MEH! Food was forgettable.Ambiance: 4/5Views: 5/5 (if you get a window table)Service: 2/5Food: 2/5We left unhappy! We headed out to check on Sutro Baths down below but had major whiplash when we discovered that our car, parked 10 meters away from the restaurant's main door, was broken into! Not the restaurant's fault but they could've been a little more helpful by at least telling us how to report the incident. But oh well! We are so done with this place!

Only go for the view

We knew that the food was not the draw of this place, but we had just completed a beautiful walk and wanted to have an early dinner before hitting the road. The hostess graciously seated us quickly by the window. That's where the good news ended! The crab cake appetizers were mostly bread, with a little crab, and honestly seemed like frozen food. The salad was described as greens with goat cheese and crostini which turned out to be literally true. We were served 1 crostini with a small dab of goat cheese on the tip! The waitress didn't seem surprised with our protest, and brought us one more crostini. The pot stickers, which they reassured us were homemade, were too greasy to eat. We fled at that point, grateful we were only $80 poorer.

Loved The Cliff House - Great Views, Great Food, Great Service

We enjoyed dining at the Cliff House twice on our recent visit to San Francisco. The first time we stopped in it was mainly because the view was just spectacular, so we had simply coffee, tea, and dessert. The second time around, we came for dinner, and the service, food, and views were just great. Our server, Dimitiri (sp?), had us laughing out loud - he was awesome! We were there at dusk, so we got to see a beautiful sunset. We were reminded of another of our favorite places - also called the Cliff House - in Ogunquit, Maine. Both really special.

Fantastic All Around

Arrived for dinner just in time to view the most amazing sunset you will ever gaze upon! The staff was very friendly and more than willing to review each and every item on the menu, ensuring you would have the best dining experience. And, the Jalapeno Margarita, one of their specialty cocktails, is to die for. Never felt rushed as they permitted us to thoroughly enjoy our dinner and the fantastic surroundings. All of our expectations, as we had heard so much about the Cliff House, were fulfilled. We will be back in the future.

The view is spectacular

We chose this restaurant for the view. We were getting married and wanted to have the sunset during our stay. I have to say that the view outside was spectacular. This restaurant used to be a bath house which was very cool. We had read reviews that the food was not very good. We were pleasantly surprised that some of the entrees were very good.What was very upsetting about the staff here is we made reservations months in advance for 8 people they told us we had to get special permission from the manager for a party that size. About a month before we wanted to add one more to our party and again they said we have to get special permission. They called us back to tell us they could but had to change our reservation from 7pm to 6pm. (makes no sense) so when we got there all they did was add 1 chair to the end of the table. - the waiter neglected us for the first half hour we were there.(but we had to change our time) We were celebrating our marriage and did nothing special for us, very disappointing. After my husband had a talk with the waiter he was more attentive. If your looking for the view stay outside on the public walkways and have dinner at a place that appreciates your business without the rude staff.

The view is amazing and, the entrees are great as well.

We made our reservations more than a week in advance, using Open Table, and timed it to arrive 15 minutes before sunset, so we could enjoy the gorgeous views. Unfortunately, we were seated more than 20 minutes AFTER our reservation time, while others were seated before us. The food was excellent (I had scallops, my husband had the pork chops) and very expensive, but the services was slow, and the hostess was quite unfriendly and unhelpful.

Wonderful!

We enjoyed a wonderful lunch here. We called about 30 minutes ahead and made a reservation, requesting a table by the window. The location is fantastic. The food Is amazing and the view was incredible. Lunch for four was a little over $100. Walking around after lunch was so nice. It was one of our favorite memories of the trip!

Good Food and Great San Fran History

My wife and I were visiting San Francisco in March and really didn't have a plan for travels. The Cliff house was #46 on Trip Adviser, but many of the locals recommended it highly. The restaurant is located on the Southern tip of the golden gate entrance. This also happens to be where a few ship wrecks have occurred.Originally this location was a spa and swim club around the turn of the century. It was very popular with the local upper class. Earthquakes, Fires and other occurrences caused the spa to close down, but there is still a lot of SF history to learn about. Many famous people have visited the Cliff house as well.The restaurant serves mostly American and Mediterranean type dishes. I had the pan roasted salmon. It was no better than I have had elsewhere, but it was good and fresh.I would not make the trip here just for the food, but I would definitely make the trip for the view and the history. You can make a beautiful drive up the coast highway or through the Golden Gate Park. You can't miss it at the bend in the road.Make sure you lock your doors an hide valuables. There are opportunistic thieves all over San Francisco, but especially along the coastal road where Cliff House is located.I would say Cliff House is a must see on any San Francisco trip alongside Cable Cars, Alcatraz and Golden Gate. You can just visit and move on, but its also a good place to grab a bite. It is popular, so be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation.

Sunset, Seafood and Style
Rating: 5

Cliff House holds an enviable position overlooking Lands End so could easily rest on its laurels. Not the slightest chance. We had booked a table in Sutro's to coincide with sunset and fortune shone on us. Not only did we make it with moments to spare having trekked from Fisherman's Wharf via the coastal path, but the conditions were such to allow us a prime view as the sun dipped below the waves.The restaurant was a delight from start to finish. Beautiful setting, grand yet without any pretense or illusion of grandeur. Our seafood was elegantly presented, the wine list extensive (yet not off the scale price wise) and the staff wonderful hosts. With such a prime spot, and a building of such history and elegance, you could be mistaken for assuming Cliff House has an expectation as to the type of 'clientele' it expects to visit. Nothing could be further from the truth. Having walked the majority of the day in San Franciscan heat we may have looked worse for wear but were welcomed with open arms. The experience, food and setting were arguably the highlight of our Californian trip.

I will never get tired of this place - great

After reading the reviews we chose this restaurant for lunch - bit of a distance in an Uber but thought it would be worth the trek. Wrong! Service terrible - ordered drinks whilst waiting for a table - waited over half an hour for them to be brought over! Waitress got the order wrong which meant my husband was served his meal 25 mins later than the rest of us. I ordered the avocado and chicken Caesar salad - it came minus the avocado!!! Never again! Don't waste your money.

There are two restaurants here; the Bistro for casual dining and the upscale Sutro's for elegant dining. Both feature huge windows overlooking the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco coastline. The Bistro does not take reservations, so come early--otherwise the wait can be long. Sutro's requires reservations in advance if you are to guarantee a table. It is the perfect place to take your wife for your anniversary or her birthday.

After hiking around the Sutro Baths National Park we stopped in Cliff House for drinks. We were immediately seated at the bar and Zinc took great care of us. I can recommend the Bloody Mary, it was well prepared and delicious. There is a great view, but get there early as it fills up fast, especially for dinner.

How do I explain the experience here. From the beginning I was so excited to go to this restaurant. Imagine my disappointment when there are only two things to eat that are not fish. A cauliflower soup and a steak. We ordered a drink and within 10 minutes here comes our dinner! We told the waiter we wanted to have our gin fizz first then we wanted to order wine then have our dinner come. He misunderstood us we guess. I believe they took our food in the back and reheated it when we were ready. Then the grossest thing of all. They have women and men sharing the same bathroom. When I got in the bathroom the gentleman splash his pee on the toilet leaving me to clean it up. The view was good, my wife liked her second heated food, and they have good dinner rolls. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE

Please understand if staying at Fisherman's Wharf/ Union Square, it was a $36 cab ride as it clear on the other side. The atmosphere was romantic, wait staff very proper, almost too proper, prices are very high. We took a Uber back for half the cost of the cab. You must give a credit card number to make reservations. If you cancel less than 24 hrs. Or no show, you will be charged &25 per person penalty.

After visiting the Sutro baths, we arrived here for breakfast. We entered just as they opened and got a great table. I don't know if there are any bad views but ours was spectacular.I read the menu and saw that they are famous for their popovers. They deserve the reputation. They arrived piping hot and delicious. I have a thing; I can't eat butter on bread unless it melts. The popovers were hot enough to melt my butter. I bought a package of the mix to take home with me.My brother, who had dined here previously, had an omelette. He said it was good.I had the sourdough french toast. Didn't know what to expect. I don't eat a lot of sourdough bread but based on it's texture and consistency figured it would be good. It was one of the best french toast meals I have ever had. It had a nice "crust" on the outside but was hot and soft on the inside. Fabulous.The waiter, I regret that I cannot remember his name, was great. He had a few other tables but was nice and took time to answer questions.If you are in the area, this would be a great spot for breakfast.

Mother's Day Celebration

I have heard about the champagne buffet brunch at the Cliff House before. We finally have booked for Mother's Day brunch almost a month ahead. They told us that the schedule is full till 3:30pm. We have no choice but to accept it. They called us a week earlier to confirm it and we said again it's for buffet lunch. On Mother's Day, we arrived on time and took the elevator down to first floor. We were greeted and led to the Sultra Room which was only for a la carte meals. We went to the buffet room entrance and told them that there's a mistake. The young hostess immediately gave us a lecture saying there are three restaurants in the same building and we were at the wrong one and the buffet room was full. We told her we did make a reservation for 3:30 pm. She then looked up the computer and found our name. The older lady hostess came by and said they needed about 20 minutes to seat us. The young hostess still barked at us saying next time "you need to book for Buffet so that you won't confuse us." I almost lost my temper. What more could we do to order and later on confirmed our Buffet brunch. Half hour later, the lady hostess took us in. The room was beautifully decorated and a lady was playing harp to entertain the guests. The view was fantastic and you could see sea gulls and pelicans flying around or diving into the ocean waves. Just the view was worth the trip.For the whole meal, the service was great and the glasses were filled with champagne time after time. The menu was not fancy but the foods were delicious. Egg Benedict, smoked salmon, roast beef, ham, seafood paella, etc were well cooked and the desserts were out of this world. Price is reasonable at $69 per person. (A lot of other places are even pricier without champagne)Parking is a problem but the turnaround is fast. There are lots of attractions around such as the Legion of Honor, Dutch Windmills, Land's End with the remains of Sutra Bathhouse, San Francisco Zoo, Twin Peaks, Golden Gate Park, Presidio and the list goes on and on.We have a wonderful time!

I am so glad we did not miss this brunch at the Cliff House. First of all, amazing breathtaking views of the Pacific and the beach. Secondly, the food and service were amazing. Mother's Day brunch was $69 per person and worth every penny. The champagne was always flowing and the food was interesting, with both breakfast and lunch items beautifully arranged. This was my favorite meal of our trip and my memories with my son will live on forever!

Family member wanted to take us to the Cliff for lunch. We had not been there in many years. It was a unusually sunny day in the city. We decided to wait for a window seat. Sat in the bar while we waited. Ordered and served craft beer and a cocktail. Other person just had water. Once we were seated our waiter had a smile and was very pleasant. Items ordered were a special pasta dish with shrimp and a basil cream sauce, swordfish sandwich and fish & chips. Pasta dish was yummy flavor without overwhelming the shrimp. Sand which was very moist and really good. Fish and chips were basic, good but nothing special. View from the large windows of the ocean, surfers and running dogs made the meal that much nicer. And don't forget to have the popovers. It is a tourist spot so parking was a little tough.

We visited the bistro at Cliff House. The views over Pacific Beach and the ocean were great.The staff were friendly and helpful in providing honest advise about meal sizes, which is useful in the USA.We both had crab cakes, which were an appetiser and radicchio, pear and blue cheese salad. A bread basket was bought out and what we thought would be bread turned out to be warm, freshly baked Yorkshire puddings. I believe they call them popovers. The menu did list these and the gift shop sold packet mix. These were fabulous.The crab cakes were good, if a little drier inside than what I expected, I was thinking more like a croquet. The salad was excellent, an had praline walnuts and balsamic dressing. It wasn't drowned like many salads in America.Overall, as a tourist I think this is dinner for location and food for lunch.They do all dat breakfast too, and that menu looked very tempting too
