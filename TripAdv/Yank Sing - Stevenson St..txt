I went there for lunch with a friend. We ate many dishes, but I did not expect the bill to be that high. It was $200 with tip, and we did not have any alcohol. Some dishes were on that cart probably for a long time. Like siu mai and soup dumplings. Siu mai were all stuck together and had a lot of dough especially on top. Soup dumplings were cold, and some of them were broken. We had many different shrimp dumplings, and they were mostly good. So were Peking duck, sea bass and egg tarts. It was a late Friday night, but for that amount of money, I would expect better quality of food.

This is a dim sum (Chinese appetizers) restaurant downtown in the business district. The good news is that it has a wide variety of dim sum--and some dim sum you will probably not find any place else such as Peking Duck dim sum and Sea Bass dim sum. The push carts around with different dim sum so service is fast. BUT it is ridiculously expensive--for two of us--no liquor--no drinks--just water--we had 6 dim sum dishes and without tip it was $85!!! That is an insane price to pay for dim sum. If you do not have a budget or unlimited expenses then you probably dont care. But $50 a person (including tip) is crazy crazy expensive for dim sum--if you went to Chinatown you would pay less than half that. Therefore I rated this as average because of the price--food is good--dont get me wrong--but the price is really high.

Great DimSum restaurant!!! Recommended!!

We like dim sun, and this restaurant came highly recommended, but we find that we can eat tastier dishes where we stop in Gilroy off Hwy 101. Food was a bit bland, even the touted famous dishes. Not worth a return.

Pace yourself. There is too much good food here.

This was our second visit to Yank Sing in 5 months. We can't imagine going anywhere else for dim sum. If you're new to dim sum, be sure to pace yourself. They are super efficient with bringing fresh food out at a rapid pace. It is easy to have too much on your table at once. We ate much too fast the first time around. On our second visit, we paced ourselves a little better. We'll need to come back a few more times to pick our favorite items and perfect our pacing.

Every time I come to town, Yank Sing is a must-stop. This time we invited several millenials and a few of them were recent SFO transplants. What an awesome time! We drank jasmine tea and ate to our hearts' content. We ordered slowly and steadily, sampling from the stream of trolleys passing by on a regular basis.For five stuffed people the check came to about $130. Not too bad! Very happy again with experience. Highly recommended

Took a friend from out of state to have lunch at this restaurant for the first time and found out this is an excellent place to eat an authentic Hong Kong style dim sum. The restaurant was v. nice and so was the service, the manager came over to our table to strike a conversation with us which is not very often do you get this kind of treatment from other places. All of us were greatly impressed from the ladies who brought out the dim sum to the waiters which were all well trained with v. friendly manners. This is a very well known Chinese restaurant in San Francisco downtown area and when they first started over 40 years ago, they were located in Chinatown and the management was smart enough to move away from San Francisco Chinatown to the downtown area.

The dim sum is their specialty but I have had far better - their's was too watery and the tiny bit of pork inside was pebbly. They come round with carts, hassling you the whole time, pushing food on you as soon as you have sat down. I looked around and saw nothing on other people's plate I thought any good - all the servings were mean too. I decided on chicken in a lettuce cup thinking I couldn't go wrong with this simple choice. Wrong. It was tiny. One single lettuce leaf and about two tablespoons of poor quality chicken, fat and mushroom. I am absolutely stunned how popular this place is. I was clearly getting the same as the other customers, the usual fare. The dim sum, lettuce leaf and jasmine tea cost me $26. Avoid or demand better. I followed the dumb crowd.

Attended for a late lunch of Dim Sum. Was slightly nervous about what to order. No problem. Trolleys wheel around and you just pick a couple of things from the menu and the server sums up you taste and makes suggestions. Dim Sum delivered in steamer boxes and contents vary from two to six pieces. High quality food and service and all finished in around 25 minutes, which suited us just fine. Highly recommended.

We (a group of four) came here shortly after the restaurant opened on a Saturday at 10 a.m. We were asked if we had reservations, we didn't. So, we waited and were seated about 20 mins. later. So, if you go, make reservations as other reviewers have suggested. The food is good, and so is the service. The drawback is that you'll pay double for food what you would get at other dim sum places. For our family of four, we ended up with a bill for $120.00, where I would normally expect to pay maybe $60.00. That's an expensive breakfast/mid-morning meal, and the whole experience maybe only took an hour. So, go if you don't have a problem with the price. The dim sum is good and they have a few more dishes that you may not normally find at other dim sum places. For myself, I'd go there for a special occasion or to treat my friends for a once in a long time treat, but certainly not regularly.

We visit the Bay Area 2-3 times a year to see family. There are certain places we just have to try and this is one of them right along with Tadich, Slanted Door, Le Central, Hog Island (the mother ship in Marshall) and Scomas in Sausalito. We should try other places but we're spoiled. Each year we take our son and daughter-in-law to Yank Sing for great dim sum. It's fun to have at least four people because you get to try more options. You get seated and before you know it servers are passing by with different offerings. A key is to be very selective since there are 60-80 options. Reservations are a must or expect a wait. Only open for lunch and it's not a cheap date but worth it. A true tradition.

Treat yourself to some wonderful Chinese food. This is San Francisco after all! Have it while you can.

Ha ha, the other reviewer was right, Dim Sum was 90 something dollars for two! Good food is not inexpensive. If you want cheap food this is not it. If you want something a cut above, go for it. We found this spot with a quick search for restaurants nearby while visiting the SFMOMA. It fit the bill. Everything we had was tasty, beautifully prepared and enjoyable. We arrived towards the end so some items were no longer available but there were many great choices left. The servers were attentive and helpful. As well as the carts you can order specific items off of a dim sum menu.

This restaurant offers a great selection of high-quality dim sum dishes that are well above the quality and selection on offer at most other places I've been to.In terms of dining experience, the staff bring freshly made dishes around on trolleys which makes for a different (and more authentic) experience than using a menu.Service was good with all the staff able to explain the items on offer in Engish which is sometimes an issue and barrier of those not familiar with the Chinese names of dishes.In terms of price and quality, you get what you pay for. This is place offers high-quality food with a price to match.The location is pretty convenient for tourists as it's about a 5-10-minute walk from Union Square.

Good Food, not Cheap Food

So, first off, this is not the cheap, village-style dim sum. We enjoyed Yank Sing because it is a higher level of dim sum. We could tell that the food quality was higher, and the food was prepared freshly, so we understood why it is more expensive than some other places over in Chinatown. Yank Sing Stevenson Street is a one block walk from The Palace Hotel, near Market and New Montgomery. It's kinda hidden, so you might forget it's there. They have a cool covered outdoor patio seating for days when San Francisco is warm enough, but plenty of indoor seating, but I do recommend a reservation if, like us, you need to get to the theater on time. All our food selections were fresh and delicious, if not abundant. The service was upbeat, and responsive to our requests, and they worked well as a team. It seemed like a kinda special treat, given the prices, but you won't go bankrupt.

Trip Advisor ranked this restaurant as #2 of all Chinese restaurants in SF. Food was good, but not spectacular, and was way overpriced. Btw, I make basic dumplings at home and they are cheap and easy to make, so I'm completely befuddled by the accolades. This restaurant didn't do anything extraordinary.We arrived at 1:30 pm and had a 15 min wait for a table.We ordered 9 dim sum baskets, no rice or desserts, plus teaProsFood presentation visually appealing.Nearly all dim sum were cooked perfectly (shrimp perfectly tender inside dumplings, spinach bright green, dumpling skins tender to the bite)Shanghai dumplings were exceptionalCons$3-5 per dim sum piece is ridiculous (each basket usually contained 3 dim sum "bitefuls")Chinese broccoli stalk pieces too hard to bite through, pieces too large to pick upMore dipping sauces needed-only soy sauce, hot chili oil and hot mustard provided on table (had to ask for rice vinegar so I could concoct my own by mixing with provided condiments). Later one order of dim sum came with about a tablespoon of shredded pickled ginger, another T of another liquid provided later. PFChang does a better job of providing dipping sauces!Carts were wheeled by regularly until about 2 pm when they disappeared. We asked 3 different servers for some fried dumplings. One server finally brought a basket of overly dark edged fried wontons (which were rejected). About 5 minutes later, a cart appeared with the requested dumplings.We were offered a very limited variety of dim sum on the carts during our visit (did not reflect the Yank Sing website menu)

The dim sum offered at this restaurant is well above average. There is a wide variety of choices, it is tasty, and the servings are generous. The restaurant is located near Market Street, so it is doesn't require a trip to Chinatown. There is inside and outside seating in a upscale, comfortable atmosphere. Multiple items are offered from steam carts. Servers also offer single items from serving trays. We have eaten dim sum in Hawaii and other Asian countries, and we were impressed with the quality of the food at Yank Sing. It is more expensive than some other dim sum restaurants, but worth the extra cost. It was crowded when we were there, but you can easily make reservations on Open Table for this restaurant.

During a recent trip with my sisters to San Francisco, we found ourselves jonesing for some dim sum. According to the internet, Yank Sing had a stellar reputation. We found it on Stevenson Street, and we were seated after a short wait. The place was PACKED! We got a table in the outdoor section, then selected all kinds of delicacies from the carts that rolled by - soup dumplings (OMG), scallion prawns, Peking duck, potstickers, and more. It was a delight! When we were done, we fairly ROLLED out of the restaurant! I'd give this place four stars for the food, but maybe only 2.5 for the service. The restaurant was very busy, and because we were in the outdoor seating section, the carts didn't come by as frequently. (I think it was pretty easy to forget about us out there.)

Four of us went to Yank Sing for lunch. We waited about an hour for our table and used the time to explore the nearby Ferry Building. The food was reasonably good and the dim sum service continuous.

Crazy Expensive for dim sum
Rating: 3
Date: June 7, 2017
Yank Sing has been around for years. It was the first place in SF to do 'upscale' dim sum outside of Chinatown back in the 1990's. As such, it was always a bit more pricey than the old fashioned joints. Now, it is just plain ridiculously expensive! The food is good, but no better than lots of other dim sum restaurants, and the service was quite good; but getting the check was a shock. $8 for a plate of 2 pork buns? That's almost twice the price of anyplace else. A typical dim sum lunch for 3 women who go often is usually about $60-75, depending upon what we order. At Yank Sing it was $110. Could have gone out to some really nice place for lunch at that price.

wonderful modern dim sum

Date: June 4, 2017
We have eaten at Yank SIng many many times and it never disappoints. It is not traditional dim sum; it's better. There are traditional offerings like pot stickers, steamed dumplings, congee and the like; there are modern takes on traditional dumplings (like vegetarian dumplings in a curry-flavored wrapper); and unique items (a red cabbage salad with candied walnuts that is to die for and a great complement to whatever else you are eating). Carts come around with regularity and if you don't see what you want just ask for it and someone will speak into their little microphone and the item will appear magically. Also recommended: the mushroom dumplings and the Peking duck (comes in a little steamed bun, not with the thin pancake), steamed chicken bun. Count on leaving stuffed (but not weighed down by fried foods) and on a big bill -- Yank Sing is expensive and totally worth it.

This is probably not a fair review based on the food that we had. My wife is Japanese and she absolutely loved everything that she ate as did I. My problem was is that it was an anniversary lunch and all she wanted was Har gow. My wife loved everything she ate but could not get what she wanted. She ordered it 3 different times and it came about an hour later. I ordered a Diet Coke and sat there for 30 minutes with nothing to drink. I asked twice and was brought tea. My wife love the place that I wander the desert in search of a mirage. Hopefully it has water.

Here is a prime example of the often mentioned word "overpriced" seen here under this restaurant's name. In New York City's Chinatown you can get 8 very good Soup Dumplings for $4.95. Here at Yank Sing (Stevenson Street branch) you get 6 mediocre Soup Dumplings for $14. On the other hand, the Shrimp Dumplings as well as the Pork Dumplings were tasty. It seemed like the ladies walking around offering choices of dim sum from trays were offering room temperature dim sum, unlike the ladies with the carts. They are open till 3 p.m. only. The restaurant is hard to find so allow yourself some extra walking time.

Grabbed lunch here recently while staying in San Francisco. There was a line out the front on a Thursday at midday so, like it's sister location, you should make reservations as we were able to essentially walk right in while others had to wait a while for a table. The food was excellent. They were busy so our service varied from very good to average as our server concentrated on the large groups more. The prices can tend to be a little high so like most dim sum places, you must be aware of what you are agreeing to take and how many dishes you have taken. The staff at this location appeared to understand English must better than their other location so it was easier to communicate with the staff and discern what the various dishes were. There is really no parking at this location as it is in the Financial District but I would recommend it for an excellent lunch.

It might not be the most romantic setting in the world. And it might not be the most attentive service in the world. And it might not be the least expensive dim sum restaurant in San Francisco. But that all will be compensated by some ridiculously good steamed dumplings and other dishes. The quality and freshness is just out of this world. Even items like chicken satay somehow taste better and fresher there than in most other places. Yes, certainly my top pick when in the Bay Area!Tip: reserve a table well ahead of time as waiting times can easily exceed 30-45 minutes! And yes, Yank Sing is not open for dinner!

For a farewell lunch, our department decided to go to Yank Sing for lunch. We work in a location very nearby so we were happy that they could accommodate a party of 13 on short notice. Quite soon after our arrival, the servers swarmed us with baskets and plates of goodies to choose from. A word of warning. The food that is offered on the tray is expensive. Peking duck, crab claws, etc. Stay away and focus on the traditional steamer baskets of har gow and shiu mai. And, they charge per person for tea without telling you. Sorry. I am Chinese so this is just a way to make money!So, what was good? Har gow, pot stickers (yes, because the skin is thin), soup dumplings, custard egg tarts (when warm), steamed BBQ pork buns. Not to try: chicken bun. It was toasted on both sides so I though that was a soup type bun similar to  Honestly, I would have ventured more into braised ribs and chicken feet but that would have grossed out the crowd. I left there not really full and owing $35 for a 12 way split. Pricey, right?Still, this place is all the rage and it's convenient. Better, more local place to go is Asia Palace.

A truly fun and chaotic experience ! The food is great and service is good. From every which direction servers with carts and trying to sell you delicious food! The billing is a bit confusing so go there planning on spending a lot of money .

As many other reviewers have mentioned, carts filled with delicious looking food are wheeled in between tables and you just help yourself to as much as you want. There is a price list on the table but it's a bit difficult to multitask and check prices whilst the trolley dashes past your table! So you can end up grabbing a small dish which will cost you $20 or more, without realising.That said I can highly recommend the pork buns and the chicken and mushroom dumplings, as well as the pot stickers. For those people who do not like seafood check ingredients. We were given sticky rice but it was actually sticky rice with shrimp in the middle!Lunch for 2 without alcohol came to $110 but definitely delicious food and a great experience.

The problem may be that I have never eaten Dim Sum. We started out poorly by waiting 29 minutes for a party of 3. Several parties of 4 were seated before we were seated who came after us. The waiters bring by plates but you do not know the price of the items, unless you are experienced. One item was $22.00 (sea bass) most around $7.00. It was delicious and fun. The proble was compounded because the waiters don't speak English well at all. We asked for the prices, but weren't told, so we stopped asking (our mistake). There was a menu with pricing but it just didn't work, because you don't order, they bring many different food items on carts. We had no waiter, so ordering wine or getting refills on water was very difficult. We ended up paying around $122.00 for lunch.

First rate but watch the prices

This is an excellent place for a Dim Sum lunch, but one needs to watch the costs. Three of us managed to run up a $180 bill for lunch. I have paid more for less, so it's not a major concern. The place is exceptionally well-run and I'd have no hesitation in going back next visit to SF. But those on a budget need to bring along a calculator.

Most important: make a reservation and be on time if you want to avoid waiting in line for a long period of time - this is a popular restaurant! While the location is not in Chinatown, the food is probably better than in most Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatown - excellent selection of freshly prepared Dim Sum which are brought around on the usual trollies. Try them all - each of the offered Dim Sums during my visit where definitely worth it.

I can't believe it took me 17 years to finally eat at Yank Sing. The restaurant and overall experience exceeded my expectations. Yes, it was expensive at $200 for three people, but overall, the food was delicious and well worth the high price tag. I'd say it deserves the ranking as the best spot in San Francisco for Dim Sum. It was extremely crowded at lunch time, and we were glad we had a reservation. I wouldn't recommend going without a reservation unless you are prepared to wait.We had 14 different dishes that came out rapid fire. My advice would be to pace yourself, and don't feel you have to order or eat everything that's presented to you, as more than likely, the item will be offered again a little later.Some of the better Dim sum items included the Shrimp dumpling, the mushroom dumpling and the spinach dumpling. We really enjoyed the Honey baked Seabass, it was probably my favorite dish. The Peking Duck bun was disappointing as the skin came off the duck, the bun was doughy and the duck was unremarkable. The Minced Chicken Lettuce Cup was equally as good as others I've had elsewhere. We ordered a vegetable dumpling that was yellowish in color that wasn't that great. Everything was hot and cooked well. My niece had to try the Orange mellow and mango pudding for dessert, and both were a hit.

Surprising and totally satisfying!

Best Dim Sum ever! The concept is surprising, because food is brought around constantly but in a seemingly haphazard order. You just point to what you want to eat and it is placed on your table. It comes steaming hot and is absolutely delicious! If you go with the flow, the experience is thoroughly enjoyable!

The ratings for Yank Sing are consistent with our visit for lunch. The service was rapid as we sat down. The variety of dim sum items is large with all great tasting. They do move lots of people through so the service at first seemed rushed. But with our slowing down, it became a very excellent lunch.

Being lucky enough to live near NYC (and now Brooklyn!) and Philadelphia Chinatowns, I've had some incredible dim sum over the years. This one while not the best I've ever had, is right up there with the best. There are two major differences with Yank Sing. The service was much nicer, less rushed, even at the height of a crazy holiday rush. This includes the fact that while still packed in close, there's a bit more room than the usual. The other big difference is that this meal cost easily double (or more), compared to any other place I've had dim sum.

Very surprised to experience a disappointing visit after seeing the rave reviews here on Tripadvisor.Despite having a reservation, still had to wait in the long queue along with people who didn't have a booking so that didn't seem to help us much and was a great start - there should surely be two queues for fairness. We were then given a table right next to the entrance so not only did we have an ice cold breeze from the constantly open front door(meaning we had to keep our jackets on) but we were surrounded by people just waiting for tables staring at us as if we were in a museum! They were literally pushing up against the table and chairs! There wasn't even space for any of the dim sum trolleys to get close so asked to be moved. Thankfully they totally understood and relocated us. (Interestingly nobody else were seated on that table during the whole visit to this restaurant).Then came the barrage of trolleys where you had to make a decision instantly otherwise the trolley pusher would get very impatient and move on in a huff. It's a very much "Take it while you can" attitude or you'll miss out. If there was some kind of menu detailing what each item was or had inside it then that would help with choosing so quickly when the trolley's arrive. You feel very rushed the whole time so can't exactly relax to enjoy the food.The food itself is good so when you can get what you want you'll enjoy it for sure. Unfortunately they want you in and out so don't expect a comfortable eating experience to fully enjoy it though.Finally came the bill! Well I can confidently say this will be the most expensive Dim Sum experience you're likely to have. Their signature dim sum with the gravy inside is probably the priciest item in there that I believe they charge per piece so beware.Overall the food is good but most definitely not worth the $105 bill for two people who only had 8 dishes and two cokes. I believe there are better alternatives available for half the price and service with a smile.

Slammed on Dec 26 so although we called ahead and they said to come over we couldn't get in. Better luck on Tuesday but still a huge line. Gotta agree the soup dumplings are good, but $6.25 for a single bite of Peking Duck in a dumpling is over the top. The little individual bites seemed like a great idea until we saw the bill. Five people with only hot tea was $200 and we were out in 30 minutes. Much prettier than grungy Grant Avenue, and the hipsters and yuppies are thronging to get fleeced. Very efficient and a pretty space, but not dramatically better than our old reliable House of Fortune in Seven Corners outside DC for double the money.

I have no idea why even SF locals recommend Yank Sing to tourists. As a local myself I have dined at all of their locations including their long ago closed down one at Embarcadero Center area since 1989. The one at Rincon Center definitely is much, much better than the Stevenson St. one. But, in general, Yank Sing is terribly overpriced for what one receives in return.The atmosphere is frenetic and very noisy as there are so many people dining there. The servers, who come round with the dim sum carts, can be brusque as are the people bussing the tables. The food itself is just okay. Tiny and expensive. Really spending at least $60 for two people for a lunch is just too much in my opinion. If only the food, service, and atmosphere made up for it. However, sadly they do not.

I hadn't been to this place for dim sum since the mid to late 70's. It has grown up, more stylish but the food remains amazing and wonderful! Very fresh, pretty to look at and each bite better than the last! Dim sum is brought around to each table for selecting. Dining room is small but they also have a "patio" where we sat on a cool and windy SF afternoon. They have heat lamps. Very pleasant and you didn't forget that you were in the financial district with all of the tall buildings around you. Wait staff were very pleasant and gracious. I didn't see a menu for prices. you quickly forget as you choose small plate after small plate. In the end, our lunch for three was expensive but worth it!

Having had a terrible experience at Hakkasan (see my Tripadvisor review), we took to the streets of SF on Black Friday, not very hopeful of finding a good eatery without a reservation. TripAdvisor pointed me in Yank Sing's direction, which was a short walk from the very disappointing Hakkasan. 8 years in SF, how did I not know about this place? We waited for about 20 minutes and then were seated promptly. It's old style, with a cart coming around, but the food was delicious! Fresh, tender, well seasoned, I could go on. I just wish we could make choices rather than just sample what was on the cart, but the food was truly divine. Recommend this place heartily and look forward to returning!

We had eaten at Yank SIng on our last visit 3 years ago. At the time I thought it was both the best and most expensive Dim Sum I'd ever had.Well, it's still expensive. Everything was ok except the Peking Duck. The DimSum portion was one pancake, a few scallions, a nice piece of crispy skin and a hunk of meat. The meat was too dry to eat even with the hoisin sauce. The skin was great. Other items arrived hot, but no better than what I could have for half the price in New York CIty or Hong Kong.

The food was very good, but I do say you need to review the menu and walk in with a game plan if this is your first time going to Yank Sing. Once you sit down the waitstaff comes at you with all cylinders and you don't have time to think or access your dim sum game plan, and before you know it your table is full and your belly is full and you are left wondering where you went wrong. We weren't able to eat over half the options that we "thought" we wanted to try, but overall it was a good experience.

Whenever I am in the Chinatown area, I always try to hit a new restaurant and preferably one of the better ones. I stumbled upon Yank Sing (Stevenson St) and I could tell right away that this was going to be great. We waited about 20 min and then were flooded with cart after cart of dim sum - incredible offerings and very delicious! The dumplings, potstickers, pork spareribs were amazing. It was worth the wait and I will definitely have this place on my list to hit again the next time I am here. Check it out, if you like/love dim sum, you will love Yank Sing!!

We just had lunch at Yank Sing and have to post this update. While the dumplings are still awesome, we were very disappointed in the limited selection available at 1:30. Although they were still packed, they were OUT many of our favorites: NO Peking Duck buns, NO Peking Ribs, NO foil wrapped chicken. So cart after cart of the same stuff kept coming by. Seems like they are depending on their reputation rather than keeping the experience up to par. Sad to see.(And we learned they no longer make the sweet potato wrapped sea bass. )

This restaurant serves up a very unique dining experience. It seemed a bit overwhelming and chaotic at first, but once I got accustomed to the concept it made for an amazing meal. All of the dishes I tried were excellent and the staff was very attentive and polite. The price wasn't dirt cheap, but for the meal plus the unique experience I felt like it was very reasonable. One pointer: absolutely make a reservation; I made one the night before and it cut my wait time down from an hour to just five minutes.

The service was good and the people were very nice. Sadly though the food was very average. Soup dumplings were the main reason we went and they weren't bad but they weren't served very hot either. Also, we were shocked to receive our bill at $35 USD for 3 dim sum dishes. $14 for the Sui long boa alone. If you're looking for more authentic tasting or more bang for your buck, I'd suggest going to Chinatown which the food actually reminded me more of Hong Kong.

We are avid dim sum eaters and try to find a great dim sum restaurant wherever we travel. We eat it at least twice a month somewhere. The Yank Sing was all anyone could ask for. The dishes so delicious, the service so friendly and the price....well, 2 out of 3 is pretty good. But remember, you get what you pay for and these 6 dishes were around $90.00 and worth every penny!

Very yummy.

4.5 stars. We walked from Coit Tower, down through Chinatown and on to downtown to try out this highly ranked restaurant. My wife and I are not experienced Dim Sum consumers, but the food here was tasty indeed.We arrived at lunch time and had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. Clearly a popular spot for non-tourists, downtown office workers. I think the reason this isn't 5 star for me is that because we're somewhat inexperienced, we were totally taken be surprise at the way this place works. You sit down, and after a moment, a cart wheels up and people (often barely understandable) start offering you all sorts of stuff to eat. If you look even vaguely interested, it is plopped down on your table in shareable portions. It was very fast and frantic and slightly offputting. We finally got somewhat with the swing of things, but by that point, I think we had overordered. We didn't quite finish everything and we were crazy stuffed! The food was all quite tasty and seemed very fresh. It's just that the service was so frantic...although eventually we were left alone and were able to enjoy a leisurely lunch...no one tried to hustle us along.The restrooms are quite inconvenient too. Down a long flight of stairs and another hallway. Having said all that, please don't misunderstand. The food was fantastic and I'd happily eat here again. I'd be more prepared next time!
