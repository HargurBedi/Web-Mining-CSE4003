Looks like a typical 'greasy spoon' (which I have nothing against!) but the food was anything but what I'd expected! They have options for everyone - vegans, veggies, and meat eaters, those wanting something healthy, and those who want to indulge. We had a little wait for a table as it was busy but as the service is so quick, we didn't have to wait too long. The potatoes that come with some of the dishes are delicious, and I love the way that many of the breakfasts come with a cup of fresh fruit. Left stuffed but not feeling greasy which was great. Prices reflect the area its in, so fairly expensive, but not out of the ordinary.

 The. Most. Delicious. Breakfast

I found this place on TripAdvisor and I do not regret it. I got the Avocado toast, which came 3 way: tomato, bacon and with an egg. My fiance got the same (he's a copy-cat) and my brother-in-law & girlfriend got the Bagel Fix-up and the Bacon and eggs. The food was DELICIOUS! The tomato was perfect, the bacon was perfectly crispy and the egg was alright (im not a fan of eggs) it comes with a bowl of the freshes fruit as well. They are very friendly here and even though it a small, they are very efficient. I would 100% recommend this place and will be coming back when I return to the Bay area. THANK YOH EIGHT. AM CREW!

Maybe because it was Columbus Day, the place was packed at 8 am. Large tables sat and gabbed. The staff was very respectful of them, by not rushing them, and of us, by apologizing.When we were seated we noticed how the staff worked so well as a team. DH & I both had frittatas - he the Haight Asbury and me the Nob Hill. We selected Eight Am for breakfast due to the good reviews on TA. A photo of the potatoes, and fruit, that come with the meal, seemed enlarged. Nope! The servings are huge. The fruit was all very sweet - watermelon, cantaloupe, kiwi, strawberry, banana. YUM!

Terrific Breakfast!

This hole-in-the wall restaurant serves a great breakfast. Yes, like most places in a tourist area, the prices are a bit high. However, breakfast there will keep you satisfied until dinner time--the portions are large and the food delicious. We shared a fruit bowl, a raspberry cream cheese croissant and a veggie frittata. It was the best breakfast we had, not just on our 10-day trip, but in a long time. The service was also very good despite al tables being full. Highly recommend.

Eclectic creative menu with lots of sugary sweet choices. Frittata was good and comes with potatoes and a nice fresh fruit cup. If you want toast, $3 for 2 small pieces of sourdough. Coffee was ok, not the best we had here. Place was not crowded, but only 1 server running around- when another showed up, he went on break. If you want sweet crepes, a nice place, for us, there were other places close by that had similar prices with better choices and ambience.

This was a superb breakfast.

The avocado three ways seems to be a signature- awesome as you can see from the photos submitted. The frittata was equally outstanding with its gooey cheese topping.The fresh fruit was top quality and featured a great selection of berries , pineapple, melon, kiwi and mango.I wish I could wrap this up and take it back to the UK!

We love crepes, but we came here for lunch and realized it's better for breakfast. Each of my kids (ages 10 and 12) had to order 2 crepes to fill up. That said, if you order a frittata it's large and come with a great fruit bowl. Small place and it's hot inside.

This is a diner/dive cross with acceptable food and service but nothing to write home about or to justify a ranking in the top 100 restaurants. Absolutely ridiculous. I had the crab omelette which was ok but the modest amount of crab disappeared into the eggs and cheese. The side of fruit was fine although some of the melon and pineapple was hard and not ripe. My daughter had avocado toast, which she enjoyed but again absolutely nothing special. Long narrow space, crowded, funky seating and small tables all near bathroom or kitchen/dishwasher. Our neighbors had a waffle and an egg breakfast and left without finishing even half (and didn't take it to go). A fine choice for a quick breakfast if there is no wait, but do not believe the absurd ranking. It is not merited nor earned.

We visited eight a.m for brunch on 12th August as we had read great reviews online. As we had tickets booked for later that day, we had a limited amount of time before we had to leave. We explained this to the servers and they went out of their way to seat us within minutes. Our food was served quickly and it was delicious. The staff even swapped the fruit bowl when they heard that one member of the party has a kiwi allergy.All members of staff were incredibly accommodating throughout our visit and the service was excellent. We would like to especially thank our server, Ryan, who couldn't have done more to accommodate us.Get yourself to eight am!

As first time parents traveling with a 7 month old, I can't say how awesome this place and the staff was to us! Our baby was cranky from teething. We let other patrons ahead of us in line so that we could have a table in the back and not disturb everyone else. The wait staff (college-aged young men) graciously brought out juice and fruit for our baby without even asking. How kind! When we ordered, they brought out his food first. They constantly served us with a smile. The owner even came out to say hello and talked to the baby. Incredible hospitality. It was so nice to be able to enjoy a meal without the staff looking at us with those laser beam stares! Our baby calmed down and seemed to feel better the longer we were there. Wow, thank you!!Our food portions were huge! I especially loved the large fruit bowls. We enjoyed traditional American breakfast fare, eggs, bacon, toast. It was very filling. Coffee was great, too! They have a wide variety of options on the menu. Great meal! (Yes, we left a nice tip!)

We arrived at 0700 due to jet lag and that it was very close to our hotel, Marriott Fishermans Wharf.No queues as anticipated and sat near the front on a bench which felt hard after a whileService was good however my side order of tomatoes didn't arrive and had to be reordered which took a surprising amount of time bearing in mind it arrived as four slices...(and $3) kind of presumed they'd be cooked but I'm from UK/Australia so probably my badThe breakfast came with a small bowl of fresh sliced fruit which was nice. We sampled the coffee and orange juice which was greatI guess if I'd had the breakfast everyone usually raves on about I'd be more glowing, but to very fair if you're after more basic food like we had the next day at Denny's (with free wifi) this ain't the place for you...so those my age etc will take this as affirmation to keep to what you know as I found nothing worth the extra cost: location, plenty of better located restaurants, ingredients, saw nothing you couldn't obtain elsewhere, ambience, it's breakfast!

Found this place close to our hotel and came back daily for breakfast. French Toast had thick bread slices but was so light and fluffy it didn't make me feel bloated. The crepes were so delicate I could've eaten them for every meal. Hubby said the croissants were terrific and the eggs were cooked just right. One note, it is pretty hot inside the building but we were able to eat at the tables they have set up out front and were very comfortable.

Get here early if you don't want to have to line up. It has a small eating area, with a few tables outside. Portions are big and the food was excellent. The fruit bowls that come with the meals are really nice, fresh fruit with a good variety - not just a bunch of mushy melon that you tend to get at some places.Two of us ordered crepes at our table. One came out, then we waited and another came out probably 5 min later. Generally you would expect all the food to come out for the table at the same time. We asked why the wait and they said they only have one crepe machine! There are a lot of crepes on the menu, so I think another crepe machine would be a good investment.

Fresh orange juice and fabulous coffee? Fresh fruit side included? Attentive staff? Reasonable wait time on a Sunday Morning? My new favorite and can't wait to try the waffles!!

This is not a sophisticated cafe but it does have a great choice for breakfast and you can't help but feel you have found some genuine cheeky little cafe that the locals would approve of. Away from the touristy area but still walkable to Pier 39 and Lombard Street, this little cafe offers crepes, French toast and Avocado on toast 3 ways! (One of the better choices in my opinion). For those wanting something really healthy you can have the chia pudding which also looked yummy. Basic food done well, great service and typical San Fran atmosphere.

Yet again trip advisor scores big with giving me the 8am recommendation. After our long flight from NY we took a quick swing into the wharf area and sat down to eat at 8am. I had the avocado toast 3 ways which was AMAZING. One had bacon on it, another a delicious heirloom tomato and another had a fried egg. It was accompanied by a delightful array of fresh fruit. A 100% no brainer stop if you are in the area.

Delicious!

We put our name on a list and only waited about 30 minutes. Well worth the wait! The coffee was great. One person got the 11 am crepe (peanut butter and banana), which was amazing. Another person got the waffle with berries (she devoured it before I could take a picture). The waffle was fantastic. We split the Haight Ashbury frittata and the french toast. The frittata, with peppers and cheese, was good. The bites with cheese were the best. The potatoes were okay--they were boiled, while I prefer crispy. The fruit cup that comes with the frittata was beautiful with fresh, ripe fruit--kiwi, raspberry, blackberry, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, cantaloupe, melon and pineapple. What stole the show was the french toast with the caramelized bananas. The french toast was superb. A healthy portion that is perfect for splitting.Our waiter, Michael, was great! He explained that all the frittatas are named after San Francisco districts. He gave us some tips on what we should check out while we're here. He was very friendly and charming!We would highly recommend Eight Am to everyone!! Delicious food and great service!

A small shop. Need to wait for 6 tables in the morning. While have a glance on the dishes served to the customers, we decided to wait. The fruit salad is so refreshing and enlighten you in the very beginning of a day. The toast and pan cakes are delicious too. Worth to wait!

Delicious frittatas, big portions and good service. We visited twice during our stay in San Francisco and I will make sure to go back when in the area again.

What others have said..... The fruit cup is great, so is the OJ. Each meal was good too. Only reason this isn't a 5 review is because their coffee was sub-par. Service was terrific, prices were a bit steep, but whatever, it's SF. 

Imaginative and tasty breakfasts

We visited this cafe for breakfast and we're not disappointed. Although its frontage is small and unassuming, the quality of food and service is anything but! A menu of imaginative combinations of classic fare with healthy options available too. Definitely worth a visit.

Don't let the name fool you!

They open at 7:00 a.m. If you wait until 8 you will probably be waiting on sidewalk because it is THAT GOOD! My husband had a waffle, perfectly crispy with real butter and maple syrup. I had avocado toast with three toppings. Both meals came with the most perfect fruit. Coffee and cappuccino were excellent!

Lovely healthy breakfast

Staying at the Travelodge Fishermans Wharf which has a crappy breakfast included. Walked the 3 blocks and had a wonderful veggie frittata with a bowl of fresh fruit included. Skipped the home fries. Lots of food which was very fresh.

Well worth it.

Fresh fruit, huge hot chocolates (my kids and husband loved them), fresh juice and big portions. If you leave hungry you didn't clean your plate. We had a late breakfast and didn't eat lunch that day just grab a snack and at a late supper, so they really fill you up.

Very good experience here - Busy and small restaurant. Not super pretty but the food was outstanding. Good portion sizes and good options throughout the menu. Service was great and we were checked on often by our waiter. Also a good place for a quick meal as the food was brought out very fast. Will return for sure.

Great breakfast place

This cafe was just across the road from the Holiday Inn Fisherman's Wharf and we ate breakfast here three out of the five days of our stay. Service and food were good and there is a quick turnaround so getting a table even at busy times was possible after a few minutes wait. The avocado toast and bagels options are great, coffee is good and fresh orange juice also worth a try. Good value for money

One of the freshest breakfasts I have ever had. Small bustling joint serving fresh fruits, amazing waffles, crepes and eggs. Love the bacon with avocado tomatoes. Family run by some really hard working guys. No reservations but you relatively get seated quickly. 

Fantastic

The best breakfast I've had in years. Banana nut waffle was great and the French toast with caramelized bananas was insanely good.
