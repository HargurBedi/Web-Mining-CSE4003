Located just two blocks from Union Square, below the Hotel Cornell. A totally charming French restaurant. Decor is perfect in a cozy, warm setting. Waitstaff professional, just as charming and very welcoming. Menu is prix fixe with a surprising number of choices in each category. A perfect mushroom thyme soup was followed by a delightful salad. My rack of lamb (a few bucks extra) was flawless as were the accompanying creamy potatoes and haricot verts. Milady's boeuf bourguignon was excellent as well. Then, a delightful individual Grand Marnier souffles with creme anglais. The wine list is not extensive, but excellent with a concentration on quality and value. The meal cost is so reasonable, particularly for downtown San Francisco. Just go there! If we were going to a restaurant all 3 nights we were in the City, we both decided we'd simply eat here each night. On the next trip home to San Francisco, our first dinner stop will again be Jeanne d'Arc. 

A fitting last meal in the city

My sister and I are visiting from the Denver area. We decided French would be the choice last night. Wow! We found the place. Small, quaint, attentive, warm and inviting, fabulous food. The prices are modest for great French food. I do believe the salad was the best combination of flavors in a salad I have ever eaten. Every course tantalized the senses. We expressed our delight to our lovely waitress. She brought out the chef who was so overwhelmed and humble he retreated to his kitchen as soon as he appropriately could. It was quite endearing. From first arrival to our departure at the end of the night, we were filled with delight. I will never forget this beautiful dining experience. Love this place for all its features, not the least of which was the amazing food.

To celebrate a birthday I selected Restaurant Jeanne d'Arc. From our arrival till the end of the dinner, our whole experience was wonderful; the owners are extremely attentive, the serving staff is professional, and the food succulent.

The whole menu is fixed price and you get a wonderful meal for such a reasonable price. We were surprised it is not busier. All the courses and meals were great. We had a wide range... haddock, osso bucco, steak and shrimp/scallops. The recommended wine went with the food perfectly. Desert souffle were awesome and not to be missed. Service was good. A great meal.

The restaurant is French! Very French. Decor hits you over the head French. The restaurant looks somewhere between a Castle and a Dungeon with antiques/artifacts/replicas, tapestries, statues, and lots of "murals" (which I think were those wall clings, but I couldn't tell for sure). If you like a solidly themed restaurant, this is for you.The food - simply amazing! Everyone ordered something different and everyone -except our resident steak and potatoes guy- raved about it. He forgot to ask for his steak without sauce and I think that degraded his experience a little. It's a bit expensive, but for an up-scale, 4-course meal it's actually quite reasonable.Admittedly, I have not eaten in another French restaurant before to have much to compare it to, but I was quite impressed. From what I have been told of French cuisine, this place seemed pretty legit.

Atmosphere was quite an experience with stained glass windows and deliberate medieval setting. However, one can get claustrophobic as the restaurant is in the basement of the hotel and without natural light.Food is well prepared and very delicious. Service is excellent too. However, prices were on the high side comparing with other restaurants in the same area.

The atmosphere is a bit eccentric, starting with the stairs down into the dining room. There is Joan of Arc and misc. French memorabilia everywhere, but we thought it was very fun. We had the feeling we had actually transported to a cafe in France.I ordered the King Salmon, and it was the best of my lifetime. The fixed-price menu also include a fabulous ginger-carrot soup and a great salad (and I don't like salad), along with some authentic crusty French bread and butter.My husband and I loved it so much we went back 3 days later for another fabulous meal.

I loved the food and the atmosphere. Went to celebrate a birthday. Had the prefix menu. We had the butternut squash soup which was excellent. The lamb shank was good as was the fish. The souffle was absolutely amazing! Must try it if you go. I made reservation via Open Table and put in the notes that we were there celebrating a birthday. I was disappointed that the birthday celebrant my wife didn't get any kind of acknowledgement. At first I thought maybe they don't do that kind of thing. But right as we were leaving 2 souffles with candles came out to another table with 2 birthday celebrants had the staff singing happy birthday with a violinist. I felt bad my wife didn't get the same....Although she didn't get the same as the others we still enjoyed the place and would recommend it.

As soon as you enter the Hotel Cornell de France, you feel and hear the Frenchness all around you! What a lovely lobby, with a cafe on the main floor, and the Restaurant Jeanne D'Arc down the antique stairs. The atmosphere is only rivaled by the fixed price menu ($52), four courses of the freshest ingredients. There are several choices, all of them delicious. We loved the carrot ginger soup, the escargot, the roasted duck confit (so fork tender, juicy and delicious), and many dessert options. The decor features painted murals everywhere, with a special focus on Joan of Arc. We didn't meet the owners, but their hearts must be in Orleans. It was a lovely experience, and we would definitley go there again if we return to San Francisco.

We just celebrated our anniversary here and were blown away by the food, the service and the ambiance. We have been to France and this restaurant was better than any meal we had in Paris or Provence. Actually, we both agreed that it's one of the best meals we've ever had anywhere, and we travel a lot.For starters, it's a place you could walk by and easily miss. It's downstairs in a hotel and when the door opens you feel like you're sitting in a bistro in France. The decor is beautiful with lots of stained glass, painted walls that look like fresco and many artifacts. They have delightful music playing, but it's background. It was so refreshing to be in a restaurant where we could actually have a conversation without having to talk over the noise. Then, our waiter, Dan arrived with our menus. He was absolutely delightful! He told us he's been there 25 years and you can tell he loves his job. The service was impeccable. He didn't rush us, and yet was so efficient he didn't feel like he was hovering over us. I think he refilled our water glasses 4 times. He recommended several dishes and graciously opened the wine we brought.So, it's 4 courses and our first course was a delicious cold soup of tomatoes, cucumber and almonds...so good. I am an escargot lover and was not disappointed in their version...my husband had a tomato/burratta salad that was equally as a good. Dan had recommended the lamb shank to me and my husband had a New York steak with a peppercorn sauce. Both were outstanding. I had to force myself to leave part of the food because I knew what was coming...the over the top grand marnier souffle. the reviews were right on. Probably one of the best desserts I've ever had, and the presentation was gorgeous. In a nutshell, this restaurant deserves 6 stars. We can't wait to go back. We'll plan a trip to San Francisco just to eat here. Merci` for a wonderful memory and special anniversary.

Entering to the restaurant was a bit strange. We had to ring Hotel de France's doorbell to get into the restaurant which was in the cellar of the hotel. Athmosphere in the place was very cozy and symphatetically oldfashioned. Our waiter was a elderly fellow who served professionally but also a bit ond-fashioned way. The food it self was excellent. Esgargot were a perfect start and filet mignon / lamb loin were also deliciously cooked. There was enough to eat but the portions weren't so extra large they normally here are. Dessert was more ordinary, not bad but not good either

I arranged to have our 48th Wedding Anniversary dinner for my wife and myself last night. I had called ahead to make specific arrangements for the dinner. I had never been to this restaurant before, but I had read reviews on TripAdvisor about it. I was not disappointed. Upon arrival the hostess asked in whose name the reservation was in, and when I gave my name the festivities began. We were escorted to our table. Shortly after sitting we were asked if we wanted something to drink. I selected a red french wine from the wine list. Shortly thereafter the chef came out of the kitchen with a tray including all the ingredients for our meal and asked if this was to our approval, which it was. The wine arrived and we were told it was compliments of the owner to add to the celebration of our anniversary. We were served a delicious soup, followed by a scrumptious salad, and then the filet mignon. Service was impeccable and the main entree was cooked to perfection and presented so artistically. Finally, coffee was ordered with the dessert -- a souffle. It was magnificent. A very memorable evening indeed. Thank you so much

I don't know exactly how to review this restaurant. There is plenty to consider.The restaurant was not even a quarter full throughout the period we dined, but was most definitely deserving of patronage.Our food was patchy but overall v good.It's a prix fixe menu for $52, consisting of 4 courses.The starter of soup (leek & potato) was a little dull. A 2nd course of snails (delicious) & spinich salad (okay) followed. Re the entrees; my wife's sea bass was wonderful; moist & flavoursome. My lamb beautifully tender but over-cooked. A fellow guest went for the 'rack of lamb' which was pink, frustrating!Our desserts of souffle were a triumph. Simply wonderful.The wine list offered a wide choice with prices I haven't seen equalled in Frisco.The one major downside to the evening related to a problem with our attempting to pay the bill. My wife having to go into the kitchen to authorise payment. Seemingly a pin machine cannot be brought to the table and although US citizens can sign confirmation from their seat, visitors from overseas cannot! I explained to the owner how unsatisfactory this arrangement was, it being embarrassing to the guest. Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure they shared our concern!To sum up:Would I return? - YesWould I order the same dishes? - No (see above).Would I arrange payment differently? - Yes. Either charge to the room, pay in cash, OR be an American!

How do you ruin duck confit?
Rating: 2
Date: April 28, 2017
Let me first say this: we've had a second home in France for almost 20 years. We eat out a lot when we're there, so that's our reference point: how decent French restaurants prepare standard dishes. Duck confit is a classic French comfort food, always satisfying in France; tender and full of flavor. Not at this SF restaurant, though. The wait staff were attentive. But you need to ring a door bell to get in, and it took 5 minutes for someone to answer. The wine list was predictable. It had nothing from the Languedoc, an important wine area of France that's reinvented itself over the last 30 years. There were 5 in our party. Most plates went back with food still on them. The desserts were the highlight.

You would never suspect there's such a fine dining experience in the basement of this tiny hotel. The neighborhood is not too good but inside the hotel is really cute. Down stairs, the restaurant has a really cool theme. Lots of faux finishes. Very ornate though. We had a 4 course prix fixe meal which was an excellent value at around $45 each. Food quality was excellent as was the service. If you get claustrophobic (I do) you may not like being underground in this windowless room but the decor helps to minimize that feeling with some false windows. It's actually quite a comfortable and cozy little place. Off the beaten path. A true local gem.

This was an unexpected find when our first choice for dinner was too crowded and we just Googled the nearest decent place and this popped up on the map. Had passed by the very low key exterior of the hotel several times before, didn't realise there was a super cute hotel and restaurant!Walked down the stairs (though I really wanted to try that small and rather ornate elevator) and emerged in what felt like another world. Between the tapestries, iron gauntlets, chain mail and paintings, it felt like a shrine to Joan of Arc. It was small, intimate (a little too intimate as we sat next to an older couple who kept staring and listening in to our conversation). I was very impressed by the ONE waiter who seated everyone and served every table all by himself with the energy and speed of a quasar, and always with great cheer. It was a little difficult to get his attention at times since he was insanely busy, but he served everyone as promptly as he could manage.I enjoyed the food - wouldn't say it's top notch French fare, but it was tasty, and very generous in portion size. The escargot were swimming in oil, but tasted fantastic. I had the lamb loin - medium and very tender. My companion is vegetarian, and at first we were dismayed that there was almost nothing he could eat there, but the waiter arranged to have vegetarian options done specially for him, which he enjoyed.For dessert, I had the souffle while my companion had the chocolate mousse. The souffle is huge! I enjoyed the souffle, but it was simply too big and sweet for me to finish. I'm usually not a fan of mousse, but tasting their chocolate mousse made a convert out of me! Not too sweet, very balanced taste, super yummy.I'd recommend this place for a date night for a slightly different experience. The small interior does not suit big noisy groups. Am also now very curious about staycation-ing in the hotel!

I was surprised at the small size of the restaurant but the decor, service and food were wonderful. It was my first time eating escargot and I enjoyed it.

For the main, my husband had rabbit and I had filet mignon, the beef was soft and tender, really delicious. For dessert, we both had souffle. That was the best thing to finish the meal. The staff were friendly and smiled all the time. We really enjoyed the experience, would definitely go back next time we visit SF.

Overbooking

Very overrated restaurant which only cares about filling its tables. The last time I ate there it was correct, but not excellent.I reserved this restaurant 2 weeks ago for a stay in San Francisco for the 28th of January. Yesterday, I was informed by their booking site, open tables that the restaurant had cancelled my reservation. I called them up to find out why The first time I was put on hold and no one picked up. I called back and this time I was put in touch with the owner. She told me that she had cancelled my reservation because she had a group of 28 and there was no room for 2, even though I had booked first. She said she was sorry and had tried to call me several times which is false because on my iPhone there was no evidence of a call from San Francisco. Obviously, she is only interested in filling up her tables and 2 people are not important to her. Maybe on a dead night she'll reconsider that 2 people are important to her business. I suggest that everyone beware of her policy of overbooking and cancelling--she runs her business like an airline and obviously if you don't have status, you're not important. As I told her, there are plenty of restaurants in San Francisco, and probably better ones. Too bad for her.

Went with my date and this was an authentically French restaurant. As people in past reviews have claimed, the ambiance is romantic and breath taking. The prefixed menu was delicious (come hungry). My girlfriend commented that the Escargot was not rubbery or very chewy as people have described - they actually make it well. At our table, we had a waiter who was to the point and a sort of ruined the ambiance - it made us feel like we were in France which is another reason to give this a 5 star review for authenticity ! Jokes aside, everyone else was very hospitable and I would consider coming back here again.

The staff is wonderful and the owner was present, also dining, and he was extremely endearing. But beyond the amazing, romantic atmosphere was the first rate cuisine. 

Very cool atmosphere, excellent staff and lovely food.

Just had breakfast, but loved the place and our server (once we got past a bit of a language barrier).

Place is dark and in the basement of a small hotel. The room was very warm and stuffy. There were no offerings for a vegetarian and the option offered was "a plate of vegetables". For $48 we could do better and left.

Far from good

I had good expectations about this restaurants as it was considered a hidden gem. Au contraire, this restaurant is a major disppointment. Portions were way too big , not warm enough and it did not taste good. What appears to be a good price becomes an extorsion.

Dessert was the Highlight

POOR EXPERIENCE

Booked through open table. Restaurant is located in basement of a hotel. Stairway down is narrow & shabby. Seated promptly. Way too much decoration made me feel cramped. The basement venue was stuffy. The menu on the open table website as well as the one outside on the street offered rack of lamb--on my visit it was not available & that was the reason I went there: rack of lamb. I tried steak au poivre Way too much sauce: I removed 5 teaspoons of a poor quality gravy. The soup starter was thin & had no taste. I asked for slow service & the salad came immediately after the soup. The wait staff was over taxed & my waiter was sweating profusely. I'm happy that other reviewers had better luck.

Just the Signature Grand Marnier Souffle is worth a visit to this restaurant!

Delicious and so European!

When you enter the basement restaurant you forget you are in an American basement. It is very European--the set-up, the art and artifacts, and the delicious French food and wine list. My husband and I never get any of the same dishes, so we got to try two things at each course. I loved his choices as much as my own. The souffle was PERFECT, as was the duck! We actually came here because we were staying at the hotel and after traveling all day, just didn't want to think about dinner. We dropped our bags and headed down. What a way to be re-introduced to San Francisco!!

A SIX...the best

Everything was delightful except one problem, my entree - the duck - very, very bony. Everything else was wonderful, just suggest avoiding the duck. Spouse had the beef Borgnione which was delicious. 

An experience not to be missed!

Dining in this restaurant is an experience not to be missed. The French medieval decor was fascinating and kept my interest throughout the meal. Our server was really French; our conversation was lively and fun. The only reason I gave a Very Good instead of Excellent to the "Food" was because it is nearly impossible to prepare French cuisine in the USA that is as excellent as that in France, perhaps due to the ingredients? We will definitely go back!

Excellent gem

Someone really must have loved France to put all the detail he or she did into the design of this small restaurant. It's literally like dinning in a French medieval stone building - medieval art, stained glass, statutes that invoke the period, just tremendous atmosphere. No detail goes unattended.It's a shame a bit more effort was not put into producing food at a level that matched the surroundings. This is another of those restaurants where the food was just average, nothing special. The carrot soup needed both salt and pepper to get it's flavors to emerge. The veal was very tender, but the dish as a whole was quite bland. So, a bit of a disappointment on the food side. However, I really didn't regret going as the surroundings were so well appointed. This is a place that I recommend you visit once, just to see it. You'll probably not want to go back for the food.By the way, the staff was very gracious. It was only the food that needs sprucing up.

Best French Food Without Travel and Terrorists!.

The Cornell Hotel de France is the setting for the best and most unique restaurant in S.F. If you want superb French cuisine Jeanne D'arc is the place. If you want devoted professional waiters you won't find better, If you are looking for the ultimate in ambiance choose this piece of the Middle Ages replete with the most fantastic original wall paintings, antiques, wood carvings and even chain mail/armor. Why go to France? It is a set menu of several courses but everyone can find a variety of excellent choices. Like the souffle!!!

Very good food, very good service lovely atmosphere

This restaurant was suggested to us by a seat mate on our flight. What a nice surprise! Dan, our server, was friendly and accommodating to my dairy allergy. The food was tasty, fresh and very reasonable. And the atmosphere was intriguing and peaceful.

We dined here last night after researching French restaurants in San Fran before we left Australia. We were happy with the 4 course dinner menu choice. Unfortunately upon arrival the 2 meals we were looking forward to having were not on the menu that night. ( French onion soup , duck breast with raspberry sauce. ) we ordered another choice. I was quite happy with my meals although my husbands was served just warm . He had problems with the waiter from the start so just put up with it rather than make more problems.I quite enjoyed the experience, but have been to much more memorable French restaurants. 

Very good dinner

Difficult to choose from the options. They seem to be all delicious. It is a fixed price menu. I had asparagus salad. Amazing. The price of the beer is reasonable. No words to describe the dessert! Service was slow, though. Very pleasant live music.
