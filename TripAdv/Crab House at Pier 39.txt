A Crabtastic Feast!
Rating: 4
Date: October 27, 2017
We were quite a large group, so the wait for table (we didn't make any reservation) was quite long. This is despite it was a weekday night. But once we got the table, our waiter was very friendly and explained to us the many options. They delivered the crab chowder before I even had the chance to order what I want for drinks (read: super fast!). Loved the garlic fries as well as the Whole Crab. All in all, it is hard to leave this restaurant without feeling super full with all the crabtastic options you can stuff yourself with.

The place to enjoy crab dishes.

We have eaten here on two occasions on two trips to San Francisco and on both visits the food has been excellent. Also on both occasions the restaurant was very busy and the service was still good. The only reason we have rated it down a bit was the non availability of the wines we chose. We would still highly recommend this restaurant.

We found this lively restaurant offering a quality retreat from the hullabaloo of Pier 39 and really enjoyed a long relaxing lunch.Service was good and we had numerous conversations with other diners sat nearby and at the bar indicating the informal nature of the establishment.A mix of tourists and locals.Extensive sea food menu and speciality crabs on offer including some meals served on hot skillets.Good choice of drinks.A little crowded and warm but our visit was on a very busy Saturday with people queuing at the door.We jumped the queue by sitting at the bar extension - smart move!The skillet served prawns and mussels main course was excellent.Prices were reasonable and reflected the Pier 39 tourist environment. 2 beers, a bottle of wine and 2 more than sufficient main courses came to 110 dollars inc tip.

This was recommended to me by a colleague at work, and I have to say that it didn't disappoint. The service was quick and the food was lovely. They provide a bib for you to wear if you are having anything messy such as crab or lobster as you do have to work at it a bit but don't let that put you off. Price is on the medium to high side depending on what you order but consider it a treat

Delicious and acceptable

I went there around 2pm, I waited for 5min, shorter than my expectations. The waiters was also nice. You can see the sea view from here. I ordered mussels and shrimps, garlic bread, fried, and crab. Everything tasted so good. Really recommend! You can stop your lunch here after a whole morning touring around the pier and shops.

My wife and I were looking for a good seafood place to eat near the water but didn't want something that was too touristy. Well look no more, I was worried that it would be one of restaurants where there was a lot of hype to lure you in and then disappointed you with their food and the service. But we were both very pleased by our meal and service. The garlic crab and breaded shrimp were plentiful and very tasty, we would definitely return on our next visit to San Francisco.

We stopped in for a early dinner before our Alcatraz tour. The tables are really close together, its a tight fit no matter where you sit. Service was a little slow, but the food was good.

SF Regrets - Excellent Service and Presentation Poor Value &amp; A few Great items
Rating: 3
Date: September 19, 2017
Two or Three stars - I struggled with this review as value (Quality to Price) is a huge factor for me. On one hand you have a great view and service with a stunning presentation and on the other such poor value that you look back on that receipt from vacation and cringe. Its not the price that disappoints but what you get for it.Let me start by saying the food was stunningly beautiful in presentation. We got a single crab ($24.00) - good taste but really not much to it, a double crab for two ($89.99) that was a lot of trouble to eat for so little crab that I literally gave up and let my wife eat mine; a burger ($15.99) that was very good but not $16 good; a Garlic Bread ($5.99) that was Excellent and my primary food for the meal; an Iced Tea ($4.79) Good but $4.79 ! a Crab draft Beer ($7.99) Very good. The other 3 only had water. In the end I like the people there so I'm giving them the three instead of the two. Service, view and presentation were excellent.Note: As a heads up to visitors our $149.74 meal then had a SanFran Tax ($7.34) and regular tax of ($13.35) for a total of $170.43 before tip and a final meal tally over $200 after tip. So you can plan on between $50-$60/person before you head in.

Couple of days back went to San Francisco and visited this joint at pier 39. My son was highly speaking of the menu specially the crab cakes and salamon so we decided to try out. It was a Saturday so getting a table was dicey so we got our food and ate sitting on the benches at the pier. The best part is that the pier has sufficient open air seating facility and you can enjoy your food while watching the bay. Well coming back to the food, it was excellent the crab cakes were so delicious and soft that I couldn't stop myself from filling up and gave a miss to other dishes, which I will definitely try next time.

After hopping off the Red and White boat, we took a leisurely stroll through Pier 39 and decided to stop for lunch. The place was packed, but, after the concierge told us a 20 minute wait, we were seated in 10 by the window. Great view of the dock area, and service was prompt. We enjoyed oysters, crab bisque and crab cakes. The food was excellent and waiters were friendly. Would definitely recommend for any occasion.

Our group had lunch here on a very busy, very hot weekend. We waited 90 minutes for a table but as soon as we got it service was fast and efficient. We ordered a couple of combo of mussels, shrimps and crab, clam chowder, garlic fries and garlic bread. Food was good. The place itself was cramped and I wish we had a bigger table. Ambience was casual and our group had a nice, fun lunch.

My family and I was at Crab House on Sunday, September 3, Labor Day weekend. Pier 39 and San Francisco was hugely crowded and traffic was a mess. Good thing that I had a reservation as there were 45 to 60 minutes wait for a table. We go here once a year on Labor Day weekend, but this past Sunday was the worst. Food was excellent, but the service was the worst EVER! It took the waiter forever to take our orders We ordered lotsa crabs, seafood Cioppino, and garlic fries. They were excellent and arrive to our table very fast. My daughter has a Sprite and it takes the waiter forever to refill the drink. Bread and butter was not even delivered to our table. I have to ask twice for the bread. Granted, the food is very expensive, and an extra charge for doing business in EXPENSIVE San Francisco, and I don't mind paying the high restaurant tab, but the service could be way much better. I know the restaurant was super busy, but the busboy was much faster in clearing the tables than the waiter in serving us! I know The Crab House is a tourist attraction, but for my money, I would not be back here on a major holiday weekend in the future and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANY TOURISTS ON A MAJOR HOLIDAY WEEKENDS!!

We ate at the Crab House at a busy time on a Saturday night. So we were glad to have been able to book a table in advance (which many other seafood restaurants in SF don't allow). The restaurant seems to specialise in feeding as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. This has pros and cons. The tables were close together and the venue was loud. But service was quick, if not particularly warm. Against that background, the food itself was very good. We had a Cioppino and roasted mussels and shrimps, and really enjoyed both. The biggest disappointment was that we had to challenge the bill. We were originally charged for 2 small cioppinos, when we'd ordered only one, and we'd questioned what we'd been given when our meals arrived. Thankfully the restaurant only charged us for one. But, given the rushed service and background noise of packed in punters, I guess errors in orders may not be uncommon there.

Very Disappointed

It was extremely hot in the restaurant so the atmosphere wasn't very pleasant. They kept bringing us water that wasn't very cold and had no ice. The bread was extremely hard and we couldn't hardly cut it with a knife. Our lunch definitely wasn't worth $50, and what is up with the mandatory 4.9% charge?

I heard this was the best place for Chippino in San Francisco, and it was pretty darn good!

I ate the Chippino, while my wife got a small shrimp cocktail and fish and chips. Pretty steep.

We were recommended to go to the Crab House for killer crabs. Fortunately, we had a reservation, or else we would have had to wait at least 45 minutes on a Friday night. There is no bar area to wait, so best to reserve. The crab legs are very good, albeit a lot of work. You must get the garlic fries, and wash everything down with a bottle of white wine.

My first time at the crab house a week ago. Waited for 30 minutes and was seated. The waitress, Sarah spilt a crab leg on my dad while cutting. We were served a new crab leg right away and was offered a complimentary tiramisu later on. The bill was around $74 so I payed $80 in cash, waited for my change, but even after 5 minutes the waitress didn't return and my table was already cleaned. We were sitting there and the other waitors kept looking at us wondering why we weren't leaving. So when finally Sarah was passing by, I asked for my receipt, not my change, thinking that she would understand, she came back with only my receipt. I was planning on giving her a 15% service fee, but I didn't becasue she already took $6 from me. I just figured that's how they did things and I wasn't going to say anything about it. Figured they knew I probably wouldn't say anything over change which is why they do it, but it still annoys me. I think it's incredibly poor practice for a server to keep any amount of money without permission. As far as I'm concerned, when I tip, I get to decide the amount, and it was absolutely more than $6.

We ate here twice during our week in SF. The first is one of the best meals and nights in memory. Amazing food, service and atmosphere. So naturally after eating in a few other less wonderful places we returned. The second night was a solid 3 stars but not 6 out of 5 like the first night. The primary difference was the waiter. First night our waiter carefully explained the entire menu then recommended a meal. It was one of the least expensive on the menu but extraordinary. Second night we had an average waitress and no suggestions or explanations.

I'm really disappointed about the food. I read few reviews and I thought it will be good.The crab was over cooked and the butter and garlic sauce doesn't leave us to feel the taste of the crab.The food is already prepared because took like 5 minutes to come to the table after we order it.Really really expensive for the quality of the food. The chowder was full of celery and coconut milk instead having a flavour of crab. To make a good crab soup or any seafood soup we need to make what we call "fume", we use the shells and part of seafood we don't use and the water to make the soup.I really don't recommend this place.

We had made reservations, and were immediately seated. We had been out side all day in the sun so decided to just drink water, though the waiter was obviously hoping for more. Snacking around at various spots in Fisherman's Wharf, we opted to order just our entrees. The waiter entered this into his electronic ordering device. I decided on the salmon, which arrived cooked perfectly, medium rare, flaking apart with the touch of the fork with juices through out. not a dry morsel. The other entree was the Crab Alfredo which was light compared to the normal heavy cream laden versions one usually finds, it was delicious, and every bite on the plate was consumed. We looked at the dessert menu, but nothing jumped out at us. Ghiradelli ice cream sundays were calling to us.

This is the restaurant to visit if you love seafood and dungeness crab. Be certain to arrive early or off-peak because the food is fabulous and the lines can be long. My husband became a fan of cioppino there, and the crab was incredible. One caveat: question your waitperson for anything not clearly defined on the menu, because I originally ordered a "half-order" of crab because I thought it was high, only to receive five crab legs. The manager was extremely gracious and allowed me to order the whole crab, which was definitely worth it. As they claim, often imitated but never surpassed. It was the best dungeness crab I have ever had and would gladly eat there again.

If you like average food that is expensive, then this is the place for you.

Saw other reviews and decided to give it a try. The restaurant itself was cute and quaint and the selection was decent, but the prices were way overkill, especially for lunch! Had the mussels/shrimp/crab platter ( a small one) plus one other entree and the cost was over $200 for 4 people. I don't mind paying for great food and great service, but this was just mediocre. We are from the Gulf Coast of Alabama where fresh seafood is commonplace, and even though this was fairly tasty, it wasn't anything to rave about.

My family and I ate here one evening on reservations conveniently made via OpenTable (there was a line out the door when we left so reservations are suggested). The food was quite good -- my wife and I shared the 3 lb large crab plate and we were very satisfied with the amount of crab -- and the taste was quite delicious. The place is quite busy and noisy but everyone seemed to be having a great time. Our server told us that he'd be taking care of us then disappeared never to be seen again after taking our orders. No worries though - the server from the table next to us jumped right in (without explanation) and took great care of us. Good views of the harbor and nice subway tile decor. Prices are high -- welcome to San Francisco -- but competitive to other locales in the area. We will definitely come back.

We went around seven o'clock the place was full but not packed we didn't wait. I order the two lbs crab and my wife ordered the salmon and fries on the side. Crab was served on a hot skillet, the shell was open and unwanted parts removed. Garlic butter or oil was poured on top of the crab shell in the skillet, I asked the waiters to warm the bread that comes with the crab and he refused, presumably policy of the restaurant. The salmon was fried, but over cooked. All in all nothing special crab was greasy and tasted like crab. The view of the harbor is ok. Beside that over priced we ended up sending over 115.00 including tips.

While this is at a tourist destination, restaurant takes pride in its meals. Right smack on San Francisco bay, each table gives a view of the bay. For best views, ask for a table near the windows. Each dish we tried was fresh and well prepared. Fish and chips include two very large pieces of fish fried more tempura style. Do not miss the creamy crab chowder that is loaded with fresh, real crab and vegetables. The iron roasted skillet shrimp was good but not shelled and hot to shell. Very flavorful but would not order again. Many tables has orders of the roasted crab and they looked great. Service was fantastic.

Otherwise, thumbs up.

This is the reason why I gave a 3 for service. Once seated, the service went good and the food was good as well.

But it's so delicious that it's so worth it. My husband and I ordered the crab cakes, crab house beer and the super crab platter. The platter had two crabs, shrimp and mussels. It was so favorable. And the service from Alberto was fantastic! We waited about 30 minutes just to get a table at the fire place. And we had to jump to it. We told Alberto that we had to be at the airport within 2 hours. It was Really Busy. So we just wanted to make we weren't there waiting for our food. While we were waiting we figured what we wanted. We ordered the appetizer, drink and meal all together. The crab cakes came out 5 mins later, 5 mins after that was the meal and the beer. It was so fast. We were out within an hour. He made sure we were. The manager and hostess are straight to the point. There is not much customer service etiquette. But I promise you that you will be shaking his hand and thanking him after your meal. Everyone did. Highly Recommended

Iron skillet meal for 2 was very good, and appreciated that server recommended small fries instead of up selling a too- large portion. Good atmosphere- fit eating at a SF pier really well!

Came here due to the recommendation of a shop keeper on Peir 39 who said that Crab House had the best food on the pier. Almost no wait for family of five. Male host EXTREMELY accommodating when I asked for table of five, switched to four, then back to five again. Food was wonderful! View was great. Server was SO friendly. Even the busboys were friendly. Great place!!!!

Crab House has a great view and location on Pier 39. The service is attentive and they were very accommodating in getting us a seat with a view. The food is really good, but importantly considering the price, it wasn't great. It's an expensive experience, however a worthwhile one off that I'd recommend.

This restaurant is tucked into the back at Pier 39. Expensive but worth it. We had crab salad and crab chowder in a bread bowl. Food excellent and staff superb. And they had a nice restroom.

Service was great, garlic fries were fantastic. The crab with special garlic sauce left a little to be desired- it was mediocre. We preferred the fish house. 

Nice staff, great food and perfect location!

The crabs were huge, the shrimp Alfredo was really good. However the butter and crab were served like warm. The sauce tasted old and the seasoning was strange. Not my favorite for the price. I would not recommend it to anyone.

My boyfriend and I went to dinner early today. We ordered a clam chowder soup And a whole crab to share. 2 days ago we ordered a soup cheaper and 10x more tasty than this one. The crab was good but very expensive . It's a good place but you can find better restaurant in the area.

Crabs and Mussels

I really enjoyed this place. I was travelling on my own and decided to try some locally caught sea food. I queued up and overheard the people in front of me saying it was a 20 minute wait. However, I was given the choice of waiting for a table or sitting at a bar around a fire pit. I opted for the latter because I could sit there right away and had a great seat with a view over the bay.I ate the skillet of mussels and crab pasta and they were both delicious. They were freshly cooked and delivered to me with a fast and friendly service.I'd definitely recommend this place and I'm glad I made the trip there.

The main menu items here are the whole crabs and skillets of seafood for groups or the very hungry. We choose the crab enchiladas which were plenty big enough. Very tasty and reasonably priced, especially for the area which is covered littered with more expensive restaurants with worse food designed to prey on unsuspecting tourists. Check it out if you're on the pier

It was just okay

The food wasn't bad but it was certainly not worth this price in my opinion. Not cheap but the bread was cold like it's right taken out from the fridge and that was pretty disappointing. I ordered a crab chowder and a half portion of crab as I was there on my own. The soup was warm with some cold crab meat on top. I didn't like it cold but I also understood that's how they made it (as I have asked the server to understand more). The server was helpful and friendly though.

Six adult members and one toddler visited this restaurant and we're found a table with lovely sea views. We were made very welcome and little Tommy enjoyed the attention from the waiters. My first taste of clam chowder was great the meal and wine were very good and all the family enjoyed the experience.

Like so many tourist spots At pier 39 this restaurant had great views, high prices and lack luster service . Shared the crab for two and it was decent , much better crab on the Gulf Coast imo. It was ruined with a sauce and the servers are not friendly. Perhaps I just am accustomed to southern hospitality . Lol

We came here for lunch with low expectations. We both agreed this was one of the best meals we had on vacation! We did one of the shrimp/crab/mussels skillets, which was amazing! Service was great too. I left a shopping bag and they put it aside for me until the next day when I could come back. Very much appreciated. Would have loved to gone back if we had more time in town.

Great Crab Patties.

Usually I can't. But this time, I totally could! This place was amazing. The food was delicious. The service was PERFECT. Lei W was our server and she was incredible. She was slammed, but made sure to be very attentive to all her tables. Very sweet woman! The crab was so good. The crab alfredo was the best we ever had and the Ciopinnio was so good!! We loved it here.

The crab here was amazing! Although the place was very busy, out server was very friendly, made recommendations, and we never felt rushed. We ended up ordering the lotsa crab, which was the perfect size for 2 people. This was some of the best crab we have ever had. I highly encourage reservations for dinner!

Clam chowder is AMAZING

We were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and despite being a tourist area, the Crab House on Pier 39 has one of the best clam chowder's I have ever eaten...and I try it MOST any and every place I go. The Alcatraz Slammer was a nice fruity "adult" beverage that complimented my bread bowl (which was almost as delicious as the chowder but, not quite lol) clam chowder. The Caesar salad that came with my chowder was just the right amount and had great flavor as well. The rest of the family enjoyed their pasta, grilled cheese and Ahi tuna steak.

Super touristic place, the crab-based dishes are ok but clearly serial-made. The pros are large portions and quick service, the cons are busy environment and standardized approach to customer.Prices for food are aligned with the touristic area but if you go for wine or beer then your bill will go sky rocket.Probably worth a visit but not a place where you may want to return.

Tourist Trap
Rating: 3
Date: April 2, 2017
I visited this restaurant years ago and absolutely loved the garlic-roasted crab. I made a point to go back this year and was a bit disappointed.The pier area has become even more of a tourist trap than it was 5 years ago.One garlic roasted grab was $50. While the crab was pretty good, I'm not convinced it was worth $50. I'm sure the rent is excessively high, so the restaurant can only take so much of the blame.When I arrived at the restaurant, I was told they were not honoring the Opentable reservations I had made. Fortunately, they seated me immediately, so it didn't turn out to be an issue. Just a bit odd...If you're at the pier and need to eat, this is a pretty decent place. Just be ready to pay a lot (which can be said for multiple places at the pier).

Best ever!

This was a lunch visit. Maybe I ordered the wrong food but the calamari was the worst I've ever been served. Crab omelette was really not good. Very greasy and not a good taste. I didn't actually finish it. Husband's crab salad looked good but you can't really mess up a salad with fresh crab. Wine selection by the glass was not good.

Overcooked my matee!

The shrimp, mussels, and crab parts were all seared to the tray. I understand you want to serve it hot, but stuck down due to over cooking was a bit much. Also my opinion is in a $100 plus dinner that peel and eat shrimp should not be part of that menu. Opinion, I know. All of it was without flavor like I was being served nutriloaf in a crustacean's shell. The restaurant was stuffy and hot and getting ice for a drink was a hassle, and only granted once. All in all it felt like a tourist trap and I was trapped into coughing up over $100 for two of us.

Very good meal!

Was recommended this place by a local shop owner at Pier 39. The Queue at the door was a good sign and being seated within 10mins in spite of the queue was an even better sign!Then I knew why... service was quick, food was served to your table even quicker (I mean there wasn't even sufficient time for the seafood to finish cooking unless it was partially precooked) and table turnover was at an amazing speed!Much as in enjoyed the food - seafood cioppino was really good and so were the grilled shrimps. Dungeness crabs - some bits of the crabs tasted overdone, like it was partially cooked then reheated. Calamari - don't bother. Tasted much better elsewhere. Felt stressful eating there coz they were clearing the plates from my table faster than I was finishing what was on them. Floors were dirty with food and tissue all over. Toilets, I didn't dare enter. My boys claimed it was filthy.
