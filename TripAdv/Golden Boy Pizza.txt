We lucked out in stopping here for lunch - found a parking spot, and that is hard to come by in this part of town. Be prepared for difficult parking. Food was good. They had a good selection of toppings and Could take away or eat in. Inside is really where the local environment is to experience.It's worth coming and stopping in for a slice in spite of the Parking challenge.

Pizza by the slice, and what great pizza it is. Loved the vibe inside this place, all the stickers covering the walls give you something to browse over whilst you enjoy the delicious pizza. Usually about 4/5 different topped pizzas ready to go, but when it gets busy be prepared to wait if the flavour you want isn't there, but it's worth the wait I assure you.

This is a tiny place with a limited number of bar seats, atmosphere is a cross between "dive bar" and funky, but the pizza is amazing! They serve beer and wine, and some other items, but you came for the pizza, so order the pizza! Lots of varieties and all delicious. We were there around 9 PM, and at that time, I'd say not for families. Families would do better on Columbus at one of the nice friendly Italian restaurants. But if you are hungry for great pizza and a beer, this is the joint for you!

Of all the Italian restaurants around North Beach for pizza, this has got to be the best! It's always fresh and hot! The sauce is amazing and the focaccia crust makes it something special. It beats all the other pizza I've had in the Bay Area! Actually, one of the top pizza's I've ever had anywhere!Expect a line but it goes quick. We always have to eat it in the car, not much room inside but don't care! Price is good, employees are nice. Can't complain!

Yum! Found this small pizza joint in North Park. Small place with good music, good pizza and friendly staff. The root beer on tap is not one to pass up.

Golden boy serves pizza by the slice. It is so good, that after 6 pm there is a line waiting outside to place an order. I had mentioned it to my friend from Arkansas, and when he finally went to this place, he could not stop talking about it. each time I go, I always send me a picture of my slice, just to piss him off, since he can't get good pizza in Arkansas.

So good we had to go back for more!

Our tour guide on the Vantigo Tours recommended a couple pizza spots. My 11 year old niece thought one of them sounded like a Must Have... Unfortunately neither of us could remember the name... She did remember the description of the sign (lit hand pointing down to the door) and luckily I was able to track it down online. It was well worth the effort. Soooooooooo.... Yummy and I wasn't expecting to like it since I'm more of a thin crust person.... I had the combo and she had pepperoni. Even though there are only 4 or 5 variations on the menu with no substitutions, they were super kind to grab a cup of olives for a grandmother to add to a slice of cheese to avoid a meltdown (never saw a kid so excited for olives!!!)On our final day, my niece begged to go back to Golden Boy again.... So we did, and enjoyed it just as much the second time!When I asked her when we got home what her favourite thing about San Francisco was, she immediately said Golden Boy Pizza!

There are often lines at Golden Boy, and there's good reason. The pizza is great! It's not dry, even though it's far from thin crust. The pieces are rectangle instead of triangle, and the bread is thick enough that you never have to worry about it "drooping" and spilling the tasty toppings. I tend to stick with the pepperoni, which is my favorite, but I'll do mushroom or sausage or combo now and again, too. Good stuff.Enjoy!

Having read the reviews I couldn't wait to come here and so went for lunch the other day. After a 10/15 minute queue to order I had the garlic clam slice and a supreme slice.Whilst the pizza is not bad by any stretch it was only okay and a little cold in the middle even after being warmed up. As I say wasn't bad but wouldn't go out of my way to go back

This is the second time my husband and I have eaten at Golden Boy Pizza, and I'm glad we were repeat customers. Seriously, the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is to die for. It's the right combination of soft and crisp, almost foccacia-like crust and the slices are perfect size. Last time we were here was after a comedy show at about 2:00 A.M., and there was a line. This time, we were there at about 2:00 P.M., and there was a shorter line, but bottom line is: there's always a line. When you find a spot like this where locals flock any time of day, you know it's good. I believe it was cash only, so bring cash. Be prepared to get your pizza to go and eat it at your hotel or elsewhere, because there was limited inside seating (and the employees are rocking to metal) - they'll wrap your slice in a few pieces of paper to go, it was an extra .50 cents for the box to put it in. We grabbed a few slices, then headed over to Stella's Pastry and picked up Italian sodas and ate at a small cafe table outside.

Dude this pizza is the best I've ever had. But I like medium crust pizza. Not pan, not thin, but a decent thickness. Awesome dough! We had the pepperoni. They put the pizza in an oven after ordering to crisp the bottom and "reheat" it. It's sounds lame but trust me, it's served tasty and it comes out fresh! I've never had such an awesome underneath bottom crisp like this before. $3.95 a square (slice) and good cold $5 pint drafts. Go there!

Based on prior Trip reviews we headed to this local pizza place for dinner. Had a wonderful time. Pizza was just how it should be - quality ingredients not hidden under too much dough, local ambiance (heavy metal music blasting over the sound system), and range of adult beverages on tap (suggest the locally brewed 805). All around good time and a very reasonable price.

Being from Chicago, I hold pizza very near and dear to me. I got the Pesto/Vegetarian, my mom got the Pepperoni and my friend who is a local and has been here before got the cheese.

I would definitely return here for a slice of pizza.

At here on a late Friday night- 1:00 a.m. , then again on Sat, around 11:00 a.m. Never get tired of this pizza. The line moves quick. They also sell the pizza by the pan- about $38-$45 I believe. They also have vegetarian slices. Wish they had a Golden Boy in Orange County, but I asked and that is their only location.Can't wait to eat there again. My go to place in SF for pizza.

What really upset me the most is the fact that the staff DID NOTHING to help. NOTHING AT ALL. NOTHING. They didn't even ask the people in the restaurant if they saw anything. they did nothing!!! Not even take my number in case it turned up. They just looked at me. I was on a trip and my bag was stolen inside their restaurant and no help at all??? When I got in contact with the police, the staff refused to give us access to the surveillance cameras. This is the worse place in the world and I'm never coming back. I'm gonna make sure my voice is heard until it gets to the restaurants manager and something is done.

Great!!!

Iordered a Pepperoni pizza slice. It was fantastic. Tasted fresh and much better than I imagined. Will go back to taste the other types. Worth the trip.

If you want pizza, don't comprise walking by all the great Italian restaurants on the way. We took it to go. Seating was a little sketchy, but the pizza was awesome.

Inexpensive (and good) Pizza

Went here for dinner and grabbed a couple slices of pizza, Clam and Garlic and Pepperoni. They were both really good and inexpensive. The place is pretty small, so they have you order at the front door to avoid over crowding in the dining area.

Very good pizza

Very good pizza. This is a place where you park yourself on a bar stool, order your slice (s) and drink, eat and go. There's almost always a line but it moves fast The service is quick and efficient.

Lots of variety

Tasty pizza along with a good beer selection. They have their offerings sitting in the front window. Also look at the menu for other pizza varieties that are available. Not the nicest place, but good enough to take out a few slices or sit on the high stools for a few minutes.

great slice!

The line-up of people outside, drooling over the pizza in the front window, is an excellent indication of how good the food is. The line-up is only outside - once you pass the doorway, you order your slice from the options shown out front, pay cash(and ONLY cash here), then opt to take away or eat on site. I chose the later, and picked out a seat at the bar, were I could watch all the goings on of the pizza cooking, drink-mixing, and general craziness of a tiny yet super-busy restaurant. There's not a lot of place to sit - a few tables and the bar are the only options - and the place gives off that "dive" feel, so I would not recommend eating in to families with children. However, get your pizza to go and walk to the nearest park, bench, patch of grass and picnic. You cannot miss out on how good, how tender and crispy and flavorful this pizza is. The cheese pizza is comparable to pizza al taglia I ate in Rome, Italy.

Nice American style square pizza

Nice little and cheap place to eat some tasty pizza.Forget round and thin italian-style, but the big square were also good, with a lot of toppings. Service is very quick.I really enjoyed the pesto and vegetables one. Recommended for a short stop.

Queues can be long but worth it .... cash only!
