# Web-Mining-CSE4003

I made this project for course CSE4003 - Web Mining under Prof. Tulasi Prasad Sariki. In this project my aim was to extract data from websites like TripAdvisor, Yelp, Zomato, Trivago, etc for reviews on different restaurants and then perform some kind of Analysis based on these reviews.

I was able to extract reviews from TripAdvisor and Yelp on 100 restaurants.

I have used BeautifulSoup for extracting data from these websites. This was a first time experience with Python development. It was great experience but I did face some difficulties extracting the data.
