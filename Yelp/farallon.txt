I went here for a large event, so I understand that doesn't reflect the restaurant as a whole. This is why I didn't give it a 1. However, I had the beef rib and my co-worker got ahi tuna. Mine was tough and his was so over cooked it was flakey. I'd never go there again and personally pay for this food.

After walking around all day as a tourist, we had one final destination before heading home. The restaurant feels nice after a long day, very relaxing atmosphere. We had drinks before sitting down for dinner. It seems like the happy hour here has a bunch of great deals on food. However, it was the last day we had, so wanted to get a little more.I had the butterfish, and it tasted like butter. They apparently cook it skin side down. But the skin doesn't get weird at all. It came out very crispy, perfect, and delicious. It's probably one of the best-prepared pieces of fish I've had. The sauce that came with it was equally delicious.We had appetizers, we had dessert, we had a great time. I have no complaints, everything was delicious. I would recommend visiting first for happy hour. After that, you'll likely realize you should come back for the full dinner. This is also a great date spot!To the management, don't do anything different. This place is great!

Walking into Farallon is like walking into an aquarium. The jellyfish chandeliers hang above, the ocean-themed murals surround you, and the sloping, deep-colored ceilings make you feel like you're in an aquarium! The "booth" we sat at was even reminiscent of a clamshell, making us feel like characters in the Little Mermaid as we dined.We started with a chilled seafood platter "fruits de mer," which came with creamy oysters with a champagne sauce, juicy claws of fresh lobster, grilled and chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, juicy raw clams, and crab with a honey mustard aioli. Our server explained that the seafood here never sees the tank, and the lobsters are flown in live! Amazing!We continued with the melon/lobster/burrata salad, which had an interesting contrast of sweet, tart, and creamy. The grilled local squid was filled with a rice-based stuffing and served over beans, and one of my favorite appetizers was the gnocchi and oyster--the gnocchi were pillowy and tender, and they made for an interesting pairing with the cooked oysters, the creamy sauce, the caviar, and the shreds of fried potato skin on top!For our mains, we had the perfectly grilled scallops with chanterelles, served over a bean puree. We also had the local sablefish (cod), which came with beautifully crispy skin, fava beans, and sliced potatoes, but the entree I liked the best was the duck breast. It was cooked to medium rare, sliced, and served with bing cherries (what a seasonal ingredient!), tender turnips, hericot verts, and a delicious duck jus, which simply brought the entire dish together. Though some of the duck slices were a little bit tough, overall, the flavors of this dish just worked so well together!And then came dessert--we opted for the light strawberry-rhubarb pavlova, which came with a creamy center, macerated strawberries, and was topped little dollops of meringue. A great finish to the meal! We really got the full experience at Farallon. Overall, the food is a little bit on the pricey side and is not the absolute best seafood I've had in the Bay Area, but this is the place to come for great wines, friendly, knowledgeable service, and a beautiful atmosphere.

Happy hour daily from 4:30pm - 6:00pm at the Jellyfish Lounge. Came here after drinks at The View for a quick snack on a Monday. It was pretty dead, but then again, it was only 5pm. Ordered:x 6 HH oysters -The oysters were small to medium sized oysters which were great. They didn't give us horseradish, but saw the party next to us receive some. Maybe you have to ask?x Mezcal Ceviche -It tasted fishy :(x Caviar - I forgot which one we ordered, but all caviars are 50% off during HH. This is an incredible deal. However, the only toppings they served with this was chives and creme fraiche. MEH. I looked through pictures here and some people received theirs with 4 other toppings which is what I really wanted. Not sure if it's because of HH or what. I also disliked how they served this with toast that was so thick and buttery it almost overpowered the taste of everything else. In all, the HH menu is just OK. You get high quality foods for a very good price, but taste wise it's just meh. This place is slightly rundown too. I think Farallon is worth it for the HH drinks/oysters, but other than that, it's whatevers.

Your standard tourist American cuisine and restaurant with under the sea decor. Really like the interior. My friends booked it and happy with the choice because it is a SF staple, plus I was here to celebrate my actual birthday. I did like my meal but I felt it was over price. The dinner that day was more expensive than most of the Michelin's Star I went during my birthday month. I got their sea bass and it was good, lots of flavor but no wow factor. We got the Prosciutto Salad and Soft Shell Carbs as starters. They were all good but average. My friend got the Ribeye and he said it was good but he can get better for $50. Over I like my meal and service but it wasn't anything amazing.

Everything was perfectly delicious from start to finish! Gem Salads for starters; Foie Gras and Squash Blossom stuffed with Dungeness Crabmeat for appetizers; Lingcod with Cherry Tomatoes and Scallops over Risotto garnished with Grilled Grapes for entrees; Chocolate Cream with Croissant and Doughnut with Peanut Butter Ice Cream for desserts. Truly amazing! Not to forget....Service was absolutely flawless!

This was one of the nicest meals I've ever had. From the attention we received from the FOH, delicately timed moments between courses, to the little "crumber" the food runner used to clean my fathers mess, it was just flawless. I called ahead and painfully asked for a vegetarian meal and what the kitchen made for me was so thoughtful and filling, I just wanted to make sure that the chefs and cooks knew how much I appreciated it. It was my fathers birthday and the lobster he ordered with beets and burrata, heightened by the micro mint, moved him to silence. He said he had never thought about a dish's composition so deeply. The desserts were playful, seasonal, and wonderfully plated. I loved watching the sous or executive chef quietly expediting and handling the evening. Beautiful restaurant, talented chefs, flawless execution.

Didn't have the greatest experience there, and it mainly stems from the poor service. Upon walking in, the front desk person was on the phone for about 10 minutes before attending to us. During the dinner, one of the waiter bumped into the back of my chair with quite some force. The two stars are for the food - the abalone and chestnut ravioli was quite delicious as was the uni bone marrow. The decor was mostly cheap acrylics - I felt a bit like I was in Disneyland. Torn whether to return to the place, the food was quite decent - but the service really left a sour taste in my mouth.

Easy rating at 5 stars this one. Absolutely original and cool environment with warm lighting reminding the sea (shells, jelly fish and so on). Very comfortable and romantic tables joint with excellent service. Fantastic offer of sea fruits and a bit short but perfectly executed cooked plates. Just forgot try the barrel cocktails ... Could we make an exception and rate 6 stars?

My large party of 9 wasn't really satisfied with the dinner menu Farallon had to offer. So, we asked our waiter if the restaurant had a tasting menu. He answered no but told us that he could go ask the Chef if one could be arranged for us. A few minutes later he came back with a 5 course tasting menu for us. Overall, I enjoyed most of my food and thought all the ingredients were very fresh but I didn't like the ribeye because I found it too overwhelming.Service was amazing. Our waiter was very accommodating and understanding. He checked up on us regularly and helped us make changes to certain aspects of the menu if needed. Ambiance was amazing as well. The decor inside was classy and cozy. Ultimately, I took off a star because I agreed with some of the other reviews below stating that it wasn't worth it. Also, even though the food was good, it wasn't the on the same level as some of the other $$$$ restaurants in SF in my opinion.

Wonderful happy hour, so great in fact, we skipped our regular reservation. $7 for 6 oysters? YES. The mignonette was delicious and the shuck was clean. Everything tasted good and fresh. We also ordered ceviche which had a little kick. The burgers were small but delicious. I had a manhattan and it kicked my butt! Older decor, kindof reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory, but overall yes a definite stop. We'll be back.

TLDR - Fancy, upscale restaurant with classy ambiance and beautiful underwater decor. They have a great oyster HH (6 for $7), but the sliders shouldn't be missed either!How to Dine at a $$$$ Restaurant for $$, Featuring Farallon1. Go during HH, 4:30-6PM in the Jellyfish Lounge2. Order oysters - 6 oysters for $7!3. Order beef sliders - 2 sliders for $74. Order more oystersAmongst all the overhyped restaurants of SF, Farallon is definitely one of the more underrated ones in my opinion. I'd never heard of it until I was looking for $1 oyster happy hours, and probably would have never visited otherwise as it's rather expensive for a normal meal.The restaurant is very close to Union Square but easily missed since the front is rather unassuming. Walking inside though, you're immediately taken into an underwater world with beautiful jellyfish lamps hanging from the ceiling. The Jellyfish Lounge is where they have their HH specials; normal dining is in the back. Classy, upscale ambiance.My friend and I got there around 5:30PM and snagged the last spot for 2 at a table by the door. Not a great spot for a large group. 2-3, maybe 4 people max, would work well here. Good spot for solo diners too. We ordered 3 orders of oysters (18 total), the ceviche and the sliders and thought that was just the right amount of food for us. The oysters were good, but not gonna lie, those sliders were better!* SIX FEATURED OYSTERS ($7) - 4/5Fresh! More on the briny side than I would've liked, but I still enjoyed them.* MEZCAL CEVICHE ($7) - 3.5/5[w/ avocado mousse, spiced tostada]Just okay. Not sure what makes it mezcal. The ceviche was a little on the acidic side.* TWO BEEF SLIDERS ($7) - 5/5[w/ crisp onions]Simple and plain-looking but one of the best sliders I've had! The patty was a beautiful medium rare pink (slightly more on the rare side) and sooo juicy. Good size and will fill you up more compared to the other HH items. The crisp onions were like very thin, delicate onion rings.

Pricey restaurant but with the quality you get, it is very reasonable.The seafood entrees were superb and the service was excellent. We really enjoyed the ambience too. We had the shrimp cheviche, the sablefish and scallop entrees, and pasta on the side. All were really really good. I will come back to this place again.

This restaurant has a brilliant marketing scheme. Draw in unsuspecting patrons with the BEST happy hour in San Francisco, then entice them with incredible service and cuisine. My friend and I came here for happy hour because we couldn't resist the idea of sitting in the Jellyfish Lounge. When we arrived, however, we chose to sit at a small table by the window instead of at the bar areas under the jellyfish shaped chandeliers.WE ATE SO MUCH. It was supposed to be an innocent happy hour, but we seriously feasted, and I hardly had room for actual dinner when I went home to my boyfriend. We started off with two dozen oysters, chicharones, and some cocktails. The oysters were mid sized and sooo fresh and delicious! My favorite were the chicharones, which are made in house. They were a bit salty for my friend, but they added variety in flavor and texture throughout the rest of the items we ordered.For round two, we got more oysters, in addition to the sliders and ceviche. This was all on the happy hour menu, somewhere between $5 and $7. And I got a refill on my margarita. The sliders were amazingly juicy and filling. For such good happy hour prices, I half expected the food to be subpar, but this was some high class stuff. I'd actually love to come here for a fancy dinner sometime. Or just another happy hour adventure.The best part was our smiling and hospitable waitress. I think the staff here was blown away by how much my friend and I could eat. They checked in on us regularly and cleared our dishes in a timely manner. I'm already excited to come here again, either for happy hour or dinner. Tourist or local, come check out this upscale and welcoming Union Square restaurant!

Shells & starfish find their way into Farallon's underwater-themed decor, & not in an understated way, either. From top to bottom, the restaurant is unapologetically decorated in "under the sea" meets old school SF. Shades of blues & greens, jellyfish-shaped chandeliers, a Neptune Palace-esque mosaic -- your senses are bombarded with this oceanic setting & it's fun, if not amusing, to behold. However, we were underwhelmed by the food. We started our pre-theater meal with the Grand Platter (chilled crab, lobster, oysters, & shrimp.) Even with the various condiments & plentiful portions, this platter paled in comparison to others we've had throughout the years. Everyone at our table ordered filet or ribeye (yup, I brought a bunch of meat lovers to a seafood restaurant!) I was the exception; I ordered a cod & lobster dish that made me wish I'd picked either another item or another restaurant, entirely. Farallon's been around for two decades, perhaps it's time they revamped their recipes & freshened up their menu, as everything on my plate was quite humdrum. I'd been hesitant to visit this restaurant for years. For a hefty price, I finally found out Farallon was better off a forgotten bookmark than a confirmed dud.

This place was cool if you're looking for a change of pace in atmosphere.

Wow I've written so many SF reviews for this trip and I have yet to give a single 5 star for anything...which is rare, because my reviews are normally 5 star...Anyway...this won't be a 5 star review either.The question is whether it is a 3 or 4 star experience...The menu on the website is a little different than what we got in the restaurant.My boss got the halibut and I got the short ribs with the dungeness crab supplement.We also got a few scotch flights.The service was slow. They seemed to forget about our first scotch flight.The best food was stuff we didn't order. The amuse bouche was great, and we got a halibut ceviche (I think our order was lost as we waited forever to get to this part of the dinner). I normally hate most ceviches, but their halibut ceviche was amazing.Then the food came.My boss enjoyed his halibut.My short ribs were "OK" - they were a little dry. There was more dungeness crab than I expected, but it was full of little pieces of shell. The dungeness crab meat was a little mushy too (too much time in the freezer?).Overall I didn't feel it was worth the money.

Finally, the BF made a decision for dinner that didn't suck!Arrived a few minutes early and was seated promptly at 8:15 (our reservation time). The only issue I had was that we had to wait an unusually long time for our server to arrive to take our orders and to bring us our food. We watched the table next to us (who arrived at the same time) get halfway through their meal when our mains arrived. The interior is beautiful with nautical themed mosaic designs that were tastefully weathered-looking, and the booths and chairs had a lovely rounded look to match the porthole decor on the walls. Lovely jellyfish chandeliers by the front. Every time I go to a nice seafood restaurant with the BF, he ends up ordering the dish I want and since I want to sample the variety of entrees the restaurant orders, I usually go with my second choice. BF chose the sablefish, and I went with the albacore tuna. Hollandaise was a bit of an odd pairing with the tuna since it was super heavy and rich. The sablefish on the other hand - perfection. Desserts were all at $11 and were neatly and artistically plated. The Nutella bar got a bit too chocolatey in the end when we ran out of ice cream to eat it with, but if you're into that kinda thing, definitely go for that. Might come back solo for the sablefish.

Service is amazing, food is ok. The portions are super small, as can be expected from an expensive/fancy restaurant. The beets & crab appetizer was good, although I only got a few bites. We also got the gnocchi appetizer, which came with like 5 gnocchi. My BF & I were literally laughing & taking pictures of how small the food portions were.For the main dish, I got the scallops, which were cooked great, but was SUPER SALTY with the dressing and vegetables it came with. I literally could only eat the scallops and left the rest on the plate. At this point I didn't want to give dessert a chance, so we got just the check, which ended up being almost $200 with tax & tip. Loved the service, all restaurant staff members were nice & attentive. But if we're going to pay that much, I'd like some good food too!

Superb service and good food. Some people may think the decor is a bit tacky, but I think it's more in the classic side (Esp with the color scheme, dome, and the jellyfish lamps).The seafood is quite fresh. I am not usually crazy about oysters but they are very tasty especially paired with the sharpness of lime juice and their delicious cocktail sauce. The Ceviche was also delicious, made with real crab meat and squids. They have good cheese selections. Try the raw sheep milk cheese!Putting the food aside, the service is what makes this place stand out. They are not imposing or overbearing, very well executed.Do check them out, at least for the happy hour since they have really good happy hour deal. I didn't go to the restroom so I can't comment about that. The venue seems clean in general under the evening dimmed light.

Came here for a friend's birthday. The design is beautiful. It is a nice place with cloth napkins and tablecloths and put together human beings in fancy clothes. It is a great place to celebrate. The staff was very kind and patient. They spent quite a bit of time talking to is and explaining the wine and the dishes. We start with champagne and oysters which were delicious but expensive for what they were considering the high quality of food in sf. Then we had the fish tartar which was fantastic and highly recommend. The fish was very high quality and really flavorful cuts. For entree I had the lingcod which was So flavorful and rich. The wait staff worked hard to get us to our show by 8pm. It was a great dinner, more than average for sure. I think the food was probably worth it but with so many great places in sf I would probably hold off on coming here unless you really have a whole night to devote/special occasion and you just got paid before checking out this place.

Farallon was the venue for a late Valentine's Day dinner. With a 9 p.m. reservation, we missed the dinner crowd. However, even with a reservation, we were asked to wait as our table wasn't yet ready. A hostess walked us to our seats, and we met our server for the evening. Our server greeted us warmly, welcoming us to the establishment. He explained the menu and the special Valentine's Day tasting menu. He stated we could swap out items on the menu in favor of creating our own tasting menu, but when we asked to substitute a similar-priced appetizer for another, as the entire table must order the tasting menu and we wanted to increase variety, the chef denied us this option, stating the low stock of main course ingredients as the reason. This didn't make sense to us, but my dining partner and I went with the flow. The dungeness crab and beets (on the regular menu, as well) was well-designed and executed, with succulent crab and crunchy beets to highlight this dish. The sablefish had the skin in-tact, blackened and crispened such that it complemented the white, flaky fish well. The clam chowder, however, lacked what makes clam chowder clam chowder: clam. and bacon. and oyster crackers. I had to ask for this to be delivered, as it was skipped, and when finally presented after the main course, it was explained the dish had to be hastily made, as they had run out of the original batch. My dining partner was looking forward to this dish, and was left sorely disappointed. I wish they had offered another soup in its stead. The beef rib was tender and juicy, and made for the heaviest of tasting menu components. We didn't leave the restaurant hungry, but we did leave disappointed. The greatest disappointment was the dessert, with the delivery of a sour sorbet in an overtly-sweet sugar-based meringue casing. Props for presentation, but zero credit for quality. Given that Farallon is known for their service, I felt intimidated to even point this out. When I did, one of the servers told our server and he came back with the same plate of half-eaten sour sorbet and explained nicely that he was also providing me a new scoop of sweet sorbet. This is where I cannot recommend Farallon. This is not how a fine dining restaurant should have handled this. This is where the server or the host should have offered a replacement. Especially when taking my plate, one server noted, almost in solidarity with me, "TOO MUCH SUGAR, I KNOW." Overall, I would recommend following Yelper Jessie L's instructions and come here solely for the oysters and sliders during HH. I cannot bring myself to recommend this restaurant for a full meal, having had a sub-par dining experience on a special occasion.

We would have complained and asked for new drinks, but our server disappeared until after our food arrived.We had the pork and the sablefish, both had really nice flavors but were so salty it was hard to eat. Plus, what could have been beautiful crispy skin on the sablefish was rubbery and soggy.Beautiful restaurant with expensive, bad food. Inattentive service. Worst martini ever made.What a shame

As a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday, I brought him here. We Barted into the City, and once I lead him to the entrance of the restaurant, and announced, "Here we are!" he exclaimed, "Woah! Hey, there's jellyfishes!!!"Flashback to the prior evening, when another restaurant I had booked had to cancel my reservation due to the weather, forcing them to close the restaurant for safety and repairs on a short notice. Oh well, Farallon was another dressy restaurant I had been eyeing. I made a reservation through OpenTable, and also gave them a call to ask questions. I believe the gentleman I spoke to was named Alex. He was very nice! I told him it was my boyfriend's birthday, and I wanted to know what the seating was like in the restaurant. He asked me if we preferred to sit across from each other (table option) or next to each other (a booth option). I instantly chose the booth option. As for locations within the restaurant, there's an upstairs and a downstairs. I chose him to pick a booth in an area that would be the most romantic. I also asked if "Happy Birthday" would be written on his dessert, and he said yes, that it would be written upon the dessert of his choice.The next day, it was Monday. As we Barted into San Francisco, we were running late for our 6:30 reservation. I called the restaurant, and asked them if it was possible to push our reservation to 7:00. It was no problem.Once we got into the restaurant and claimed my reservation, the ladies at the front asked if we needed to check in any coats or belongings. That was nice of them to ask, but I said no, and instead asked where the bathroom was. It's right on the first floor, by the stairs, and before entering the dining area. It was a very clean, though kind of small bathroom with a few stalls, but it's well-lit. And emphasis on cleanliness; ladies, I'm sure we all know the feeling of going to a restaurant and going to the bathroom to switch out of our street shoes into our heels. The entrance and the restaurant decor, by the way, is wonderful. Once you step in, you instantly notice the jellyfish chandeliers hanging above. They're beautiful and unique. We were lead to our booth in the main dining hall, which is dimly lit, and has tentacle chandeliers (my boyfriend thinks they're coral, I think they're tentacles). As a pleasant surprise, a happy birthday card in an envelope was sitting atop our table, waiting for us.We were instantly served water upon request. For drinks, my boyfriend ordered the Rose of Cinsault, and I ordered the Sake (I was intrigued by the name Bride of the Fox). His Rose was very refreshing and not overly bubbly, like some Roses that I've tried. My Sake was sweet, but not too sweet.After ordering, we were each given a small plate of bread. There were two types of bread: one was a piece of a croissant, the other seemed to be walnut bread. The butter was sprinkled with Hawaiian salt. My boyfriend and I dislike butter on its own, but with the Hawaiian salt, the flavor was wonderful. I didn't know it was Hawaiian salt until I read another review.For appetizers, we ordered oysters. We ordered two of each: Drake's Bay, Kumamoto, and Kusshi. I'm not an oyster connoisseur, so I can't comment on the subtle flavors and textures, but we both enjoyed them very much.For entrees, he ordered Local Sablefish, and I ordered Reichardt Farm Duck Breast. We also shared our entrees. The sablefish was delicious, and the crunchy, crispy skin was the best part. The mashed potatoes (yukon gold potato puree) were creamy, the smoked mussels were delicious, and the lollipop kale was the best kale I've ever eaten. I think the sauce from the potatoes was what made the kale so delightful.The duck breast was divine. I'm used to Peking duck, and the slices of duck were very tender and delightful. I guess the sauce was Cinderella pumpkin? For dessert, he chose Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, and I chose the Pumpkin Spice Sundae. His dessert came with "Happy Birthday" written in chocolate, and a lit candle. We also shared our desserts, and enjoyed it all very much.When the bill came, it came out to $165.01. Not bad! Especially since other reviews said to expect to spend over $200 for a party of two. Food is definitely pricey, but that's to be expected for a high-end dressy restaurant.I'm impressed with how we were treated as well. My boyfriend and I were the youngest ones in the restaurant, but the waitstaff treated us with respect as they would with any other older diners. I've experienced service elsewhere that treated younger individuals more rudely, so I was impressed with the professionalism here. They refilled our water glasses, they checked in on us without being invasive, they brought out our food and drinks in a timely fashion, and were kind to take photos of us on our phones upon request.We both want to come back, especially for the oyster happy hour!

Me and wife decided to take the Bart down to SF To basically get dinner and to be more specific sea food. Of course once we got out of the mall mayhem and made it to the street I used Yelp to guide me. I just want to repeatedly write: best lobster ever but I'll be a little more detailed than that......To start the bread was fantastic. It came out with butter that had Hawaiian sea salt on it. Mixing the 2 was some of the best bread+butter combo I've had in a while. The desert was also awesome. I landed on the blueberry cake and I'm glad I did. It was the perfect way to end the meal.Now to dinner. I got the surf and surf. Crab plus lobster. The crab was great but the lobster was phenomenal. Get the lobster. Best I've ever had. Seriously best I've ever had. For great seafood don't complain about the price!

Although I did pick this restaurant to dine with my colleagues I was expecting something cheesy and generic.. I picked this restaurant out of convenience as it was close to my hotel..BUT...to my surprise this is restaurant is actually pretty good!I think we were the only asians in the restaurant and probably the youngest too, not that it's a bad thing or good thing but just a general observation. Noticed that the average crowd were in their 50s and it seems most of them were celebrating something special that evening as most of them were couples.It looks like a very themed restaurant as it should be since they specialize in Seafood and it's actually not cheesy at all, to a certain extent I think it's pretty cool.Now back to food..the food was good and exceeded my expectations for sure. It's not like they invented any super unique dish or flavor but they did everything properly and the results were great food and great flavor. I'll let the pictures do the talking.Oh right, oysters are a must order and I suggest trying different ones. I ordered the platter with lobster and all but I think the next time I visit I'll just use the money and order 2-3dozens of oysters.

True confessions: I came here for the decor. I'm a marine biologist, and just needed to see this magical place I had heard of. I wasn't disappointed. Kelp, jellies, feather duster worms, urchins, sea stars, molluscs! It was stunning and beautiful. Being a marine biologist, I am also.....nowhere near rich enough to actually eat here. However, they have happy hour every day from 4:30-6! We got a dozen oysters for $14. I mean, you can't beat that! I would definitely give five stars for the decor, ambiance, and happy hour. The cocktail was not great though, and for a place of this expense and caliber I would expect a really good cocktail. I suggest sticking to the wine.

This restaurant is beautiful! The front room has Goliath jelly fish hanging from the sealing, while the back has chandeliers fashioned into sea urchins. The servers are very knowledgable and attentive. They can speak to each item on the menu, what wines it pairs well with and even what you can finish off with for dessert.My colleagues and I had an assortment of oysters to start our meal. All the varieties were delicious and recommended by our waiter. We followed up with the tuna tar tar which was to die for and then each had our own dish which ranged from their incredible steaks to succulent salmon. We couldn't leave without having a little something sweet to end our night so we shared the assorted gelato plate and a perfectly textured, not overly sweet flan. Definitely a place worth a date night.

Superb! finally came back for 2nd round of yumminess seafood. First time was way back in 2011. Great service, still in awe with the jellyfish on the ceiling. Scrumptious seafood bar...it's amazing watching the chefs pile up clams, mussels, oysters, crab and giant lobsters onto huge plates. Mouth watering just thinking about it!! Sat in the big room, small table. Ordered bottle of Stony Hill Gewurztraminer and a second...goes great with seafood. Hamachi crudo, fresh oysters(miyagi and drakes), clams(not as big and tasty as ones from anchor and hope, but still decent), foie gras, bone marrow, scallops as my entree. Buuuurp! Super good! Great way to celebrate an anniversary =D

For a 'bucket list' restaurant and the price, we were left disappointed. We started with the fruits de mer: lobster claws, clams, oysters prawns, and crab + caviar with traditional accompaniments. The caviar (osetra and sturgeon) was great, I just wasn't a fan of the Russian blini's, which were dark and a bit dry. The lobster claws were sweet and delicious. From there, things went downhill. The crab chowder had good flavor, but about 1 bite of crab meat. The scallops had good flavor with butternut squash puree and balsamic reduction, some of the brusselsprout leaves were raw (intentionally) and just too tough to eat. One of us had the petrale sole and was very disappointed, she didn't even want to eat it. The presentation was awful and it lacked flavor all together. Desserts were larger than expected and well plated, but were mediocre. Service was pretty good, until they did nothing about the entree, promptly departed the table without taking everyone dessert/coffee order, and didn't honor our free dessert offer.

I'm so sad from our recent visit. This used to be a glamorous restaurant, but it is more of a faded version of what once was. Our food was just okay. For the price we expected the best quality seafood that is expertly prepared. Our seared tuna & grilled octopus dish was oddly prepared. The tuna looked like it was flash fried and the octopus looked like it was just boiled. The waiter was nice but didn't seem to understand our concerns, but did asked the kitchen to remake the dish. The tuna crudo was not thinly cut but rather cut into irregular chunks. The scallops dish was seared well. The sablefish dish was good, but was a small portion.The decor is faded and the seating upholstery was pretty threadbare. It's time for a refresh. The highlight was the curated wine list.

OK so this place has a bunch of stars for being fancy bla bla bla. I went here recently and looked forward to the seafood selection. Quite honestly I expected the semi-cheesy decor, as I had looked at pics beforehand. We missed reservations and they took about 30 min to act like it was super busy, but it wasn't (lol). The food was pretty good but nothing extrodinairy, especially for the $$$ tag. Service was nice but the guy didn't seem too interested in his job, hahaha. I think the highlight was the nutella dessert, which may or not have been from a box (jk but nothing too fancy). I wouldn't go back now that I've tried it, just good but plenty other amaze-ball places in the city.

It seems like nearly everyone I spoke to at the conference I attended this week ate here. My experience was slightly different as I was part of a group in a private room and limited menu but I really enjoyed the meal. I ordered the fish, which was tasty. I also sampled the steak but didn't think it was anything special. Service was very attentive- they filled our wine glasses like water, literally, if I had a quarter glass of wine left they would top it off. My meal was good and I enjoyed my experience here.

I always have a great experience at the Farallon. The service is always prompt, warm and informative. The food is always sumptuously prepared and I usually always get my favorite table. Be prepared to drop some hard earned cash tho. Nice place to impress business partners or take a special someone.

Was looking forward to this dinner, since i had very fond memories of my last visit (loved the ambience and the food).This time it was "ok" but clearly not on par with the level of this restaurant. Service was inattentive, seating was poor (we were under a staircase and next to a service station) and the food unremarkable (ex: fresh squid ink linguini was undercooked, hard to do with fresh pasta). Only great dish was the chocolate dessert.Won't be coming back, so many better options at this price range.

We loved The Farallon. Service was great in both the bar & restaurant part. Alec helped us in the bar during happy hour. His suggestions where great. In the restaurant side we had Kirsten. She was great. Fast & sweet. Her suggestions where great too. By far the best steak I have ever had! We will be back for sure. Will be sure to tell everyone to check it out! We loved it so much that this is the first time I'm doing a review.

I went here before a graduation event with a friend. To be honest I can't remember what exactly we got...it wasn't that memorable. Pretty sure we got the Fruits De Mer Platter and an entree as well as an appetizer -- but I probably don't remember because it wasn't that good or bad. Leaving this as a personal reminder that it was just kind of meh. Not sure why but I felt like the food just wasn't that amazing. The interior decor is pretty and I liked the vibes inside -- but I felt like I was paying for a "bougie vibe" and not so much because the food was good. I personally really dislike restaurants that serve mediocre tasting food and charge you for a nice inside vibe. I feel like for the same price range there are a few other restaurants I would rather go to that I've been to in SF. I want a restaurant at $$$$ price range to provide both delicious food and nice indoor vibes -- but I felt like I got just mediocre food with nice indoor vibes here.

2.5 stars. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. First, as far as the food..... it was good. Not great, just good. The gnocchi with poached oysters appetizer was my favorite part of the meal. The abalone chowder appetizer was also tasty. My BF liked his sablefish main course. I had the ribeye, which was unremarkable, and served with fries, which drives me nuts, especially at fine dining establishments. I find it lazy, cheap, and uncreative. I know, first world problems. But really, nothing blew me away at all. As a side note - and this is not really the restaurant's fault, but it was very annoying and distracting nonetheless - there was a family at a table next to us that made a HUGE production out of their teenaged son supposedly consuming some ingredient in his meal that he was "allergic" to. This family commanded a great deal of the staff's time and attention over this matter, while the kid continued playing on his iPhone obliviously the whole time. I think it's safe to say he'll live to see another day. To this family, and you know who you are: Please get over yourselves. Anyways, back to the dinner review. I'm sorry to say that the service at Farallon needs a good deal of improvement. At the price point to dine here, service should be a symphony, and it was far from it, which was disappointing. The service was not warm nor very attentive. For example, our server repeatedly brought us the check prematurely, when we intended to order more. We were not checked in on during the meal, and the server did not thank us or say goodbye/good night prior to us leaving. He just disappeared. I will say that there were two staff members that were very nice - the gentleman serving bread and water, and the young man downstairs in the jellyfish lounge who took our drink & oyster orders while we waited for our dinner table. I'm glad I got to check Farallon off my dining bucket list, but I would definitely not go out of my way to return.

I hadn't been to Farallon for many a moon until a visit a couple of weeks ago...what the heck was I thinking? I'd go again in a heartbeat, it was really great. The room is beautiful, you really feel like you're somewhere special. Service on point, and the scallops in the Scallop Tom Kha were ABSOLUTELY the freshest and most delicious I've ever had. The oysters were divine too. I think Farallon gets overlooked by locals who are always chasing after the newest resto but do re-visit!

Beautiful setting. We went here for happy hour in the jellyfish lounge. It is first come, first served, self seating. We got a table right when we arrived at 5:30pm. It was great, right next to the street so we could people watch. We ordered a dozen oysters ($7 for 6 pieces), sliders, fish and chips and a few margaritas. Each was $7! What a deal! And the oysters were very fresh and tasty! Highly recommend this place for happy hour! Happy hour is from 4:30-6:00pm.

Swanky, sleek and playful is how I would describe the Farallon.. The interiors are whimsical and subdued at the same time. Definitely a fun, fine dining experience. Glass jellyfish hang from the ceiling and a seat upstairs allowed us a view of the raw bar while we discussed important matters.. like appetizers vs. main courses. I went with all apps because I wanted to get the most bang for the buck and I wanted to have room for dessert... However, when I go back I will splurge on the Fruit de Mer - Royal! The apps did not disappoint.. each dish was beautifully presented and every ingredient was super fresh. The dishes were as fanciful as the interiors and you can tell just how much work the cooks put into each dish. Our server was very busy but managed to keep us all happy and we enjoyed our dinner, drinks and dessert and lingered on until closing time..

2016New year's Eve dinner with a group:The food was superb! Definitely worth it. The steak was the best I've ever had - perfectly executed. The ambiance was just like the pictures - we sat in the main dining room. They brought us "Happy New Year" hats and champagne for midnight. The ladies bathroom was wrecked. I had to ask the host to have someone tidy it up...back an hour later and it was still a disaster. No toilet paper available. Dirty paper towels everywhere. Water drenched counter tops. Water or urine on the floor, not sure which. 4 stars simply because the bathroom was so gross. I dropped $250 on myself that night.

Came here for a birthday dinner for my boyfriend at the beginning of April on a Sunday. The great:- The service was excellent. The host and hostess greeted us warmly and with smiles. Our waiter was incredibly attentive, polite, and brought everything out with perfect timing. Our glasses never got empty and empty plates never lingered. There was even a birthday card waiting for my boyfriend at the table, which was a very thoughtful gesture. - Oysters were fresh and we loved the champagne sauce- The amuse bouche (a ricotta and seaweed combo) was the most interesting and surprising mix of flavors. We really enjoyed it.- Halibut appetizer with the three garlic oil was amazing. The best halibut that we've had in a long time!-Pea ravioli with scallops were cooked perfectly, and made me fall in love with peas.- My boyfriend ordered the duck and he loved everything on the plate.- Our desserts were lovely. I got the almond, pear, strawberry sorbet trio (substituted out the chocolate) and my boyfriend got the eclair. It had 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate which he appreciated. He said it was the best eclair he's ever had.The good: - We didn't know what to feel about the decor. It definitely felt dated, but we kind of liked how unapologetically over the top it was. - The smelt appetizer was tasty but didn't excite us.The bad:- My Lassen trout entree was outright bad. There was a pool of watery liquid that everything was sitting in, and I couldn't tell if it was intentional or not. It washed out the flavors, and made the skin soggy and unappetizing. The carrots were the best thing on the plate.Overall, we had a great experience and were really surprised at the complex flavor combinations. Nearly everything felt innovative and was delicious. One of our pet peeves is when it feels like a place is trying to be innovative for the sake of being innovative, but at the expense of actual taste. It didn't feel like that here. I think the decor is actually detracting from the menu. Since it looks and feels so old school, it automatically made us expect the menu to be old school and taste dated. That wasn't the case, but it set our expectations in a different direction. Aside from the trout (which may have been a fluke) everything else we had was fantastic. If I had ordered something different, I probably would be giving this review 5 stars.

Had business dinner with three of my colleagues. Order the "super deluxe platter" and ordered fish and steak dishes. As with most upscale restaurants, service is first rate. The taste of food is delicious, with just enough flavor to accentuate the Mahi mahi. The tuna was also delicious. Atmosphere is has good mix of old fashioned charm with touch of contemporary lightening. The only issue is of value, our 4 entres and large platter came to $400 before tip.

Terrific atmosphere and great service! We came from out of town to celebrate our recent engagement and anniversary. A nice card was waiting for us at the table and we received a couple of complementary flutes of champagne (all with only me indicating we were celebrating our anniversary on the open table booking). This is the kind of service expected at such establishments and Farallon did not disappoint. Perfect romantic evening, food was great and so was the wine. No complaints here.
