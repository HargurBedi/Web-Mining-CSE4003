It's been a while since I've given out a 1 star...To start, I don't understand why so many working people from SOMA and FiDi come here for lunch. It might make sense to visit Gott's if you're a tourist since it's a convenient place to go to since you're visiting the Ferry Building; however, if you're not a tourist, you really have no reason to visit Gott's. There are so many better tasting cheaper alternatives that don't force you to wait 30 minutes plus in line before you can place your order. The burger here is overcooked to death, and that's just the start of it. A lot of people seem to be stopping by Gott's to try out the impossible burger, but accordingly to my colleagues, it's pretty meh. Just like the normal burger, it too, is overcooked to death. I got the Western Burger and it was the blandest tasting burger I've had in a long time. Gott's must've ran out of BBQ sauce at 11am, or are waiting for another shipment to arrive, because the only evidence that my burger had any was the fact that there was a slight red tint to the top of my burger bun. The bacon in the burger was also quite sad. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that McDonald's has better microwaved bacon. My bacon was thin, and floppy. The sweet potatoes fries here were not good either. The ones I received were pretty severely undercooked. Go to Super Duper on Mission and Spear instead of Gott's. Awesome burgers for a fraction of the price, without the wait.

I went to this in Napa and it was awesome. This one, not so much. The food was way overcooked. And when I got the burger recooked, it didn't taste that good.Same for my wife's meal. I'm guessing the people working there don't care much about delivering a good meal.Very disappointing.

Been here at least five times for dinner and each time I left satisfied. Can't go wrong with their burgers and fries which are always consistent. On my most recent visit I ordered a Special Matcha Milkshake which was surprisingly pretty good (it is on the sweet side). There is ample seating, but the line goes out the door during peak hours. I've never had any issues waiting for my food, but I've seen people unhappy with the wait.

Gott's Roadside is okay. I think the biggest selling point of Gott's is the location and plentiful outdoor seating. I like the fast casual aspect. You can eat and chill as long as you want without servers bothering you. I believe they sell beer and wine which makes it a good meet up place after work. Otherwise, I wasn't impressed with the food. I first tried them at the Oxbow Public Market in Napa many years ago and don't really remember much about the experience. The green chile cheeseburger $10 lacked flavor, and the bun overtakes the whole thing. There was no char on the burger. It needed seasoning, black pepper at the very least.My brother was eating his Kale Caesar Salad when the compostable fork broke (one of the tines/prongs was nowhere to be found in the mess of white dressing). I was not happy that he might choke on a plastic piece in a weak $12 salad. I offered to bring the salad up to the staff and request another, but he insisted he wanted to keep it. So for the next 10 minutes or so he ate very gingerly until he finally bit into it. My Vietnamese chicken salad $12 was okay. The panko chicken tenders they cut up and placed on top of the salad were overcooked and very dry. The only redeeming food item I tried were the onion rings, $3.99. They were greasy and crispy.

Good food but pricey with a long wait. You'll find burgers, tacos, chili, fries, hot dogs, beer, wine, soda, and milk shakes on the menu. Location location location. It is San Fran, so expect to pay a premium for "fast food". You wait in line to order, then pay and seat yourself inside or outside. You have to wait some more with a pager that will buzz when your food is ready and you have to go back up to retrieve it. Great place to go for a casual lunch!

Two words: Garlic. Fries. These are probably the best garlic fries I've ever had and actually fried with garlic oil vs just sprinkling garlic bits on top of regular fries (though they do sprinkle garlic bits too). Everything else here (salads, hot dog, chilli) aren't anything special and is your average greasy food. Prices are expensive but it's SF and a touristy places, can't blame them.

I love Gott's. It's a bit overpriced- but it has great outdoor and indoor seating, yummy, fresh food, and beer/wine as well as milkshakes and "diner-esque" foods and treats.Staff members are always so nice. It is family friendly and always has a good vibe whether you're meeting friends or wanting to read a book by yourself on the Embarcadero. I highly recommend it. It is located in the ferry building- usually there's a line, but it goes quickly and the food is made fresh to order. Their wine/beer prices and variety are great and diverse for a small roadside joint. Their chili is delicious as well :)

We actually only stopped at Gott's soft serve because it was a nice warm day in San Francisco and we weren't really feeling the adventurous flavors of Humphrey Slocombe today. Sometimes, it's the classic flavors that really hit the spot.Looking over the menu, I was impressed by the number of flavors of soft serve that were offered but the cone size was pretty disappointing. For just a dollar more, you can make it a float and it's easily twice the size (yes, I know...most of it is soda). However, I thought the floats were really refreshing. We ended up taking them to the backside of the Ferry building where we got to relax, watch the boats pass, and enjoy a nice creamy/fizzy treat.

Sorry Yelp, I've been a little bit neglectful about you recently. Stopped by on a bright, sunny Sunday since we'd walked by and smelled this place the night before. For those who grew up aroun here, it smells exactly like the Great America food pavillion, aka greasy wafts of all American food. I got the Wisconsin sourdough and onion rings. I sampled my friend's fries and hamburger.The burger was a pretty standard delicious burger, but on sourdough bread. The meat patty was sizeable with a good charbroiled taste, and half was enough to fill me up. Chewy bacon, not crispy, which I liked. Could've used a couple more mushrooms.The onion rings were a bit of a miss, consisting mostly of flour instead of onion! Very crispy though and freshly fried. The fries were pretty good and fresh.Lunch for 2 came out to ~$30, which is expensive even for SF burgers! Their nice outdoor patio may make up for it though.--Edit: Made it back for the impossible burger subbed in their kimchi burger! The meat patty was flatter than your average hamburger patty, and basically tasted like bland meat and tore like shredded chicken. A step in the direction of the future! The kimchi burger otherwise was fairly tasty, with strips of bacon (sort of hard), kimchi (nice large pieces), and American cheese.

Gott's Roadside used to be a consistent stop to get drunchies (drunk munchies) after marathon wine tasting trips in Napa. But I no longer have to venture to wine country to get my burger fix. This location is conveniently located in the Ferry Building and I heard there is another location near Stanford University... say what?! What makes Gott's truly worth the prices is their commitment to using the best ingredients. Beef is grass fed from Niman Ranch, chicken is organic from Mary's, ice cream for their super creamy milkshakes is Three Twins... you get the picture. Everything is made right there in front of you. Don't sleep on the specials... today there was a legit fish taco special featured and Mexican style corn (mayo, parm, seasoning). Also they do have beer specials (pictured) and tasty wines to compliment your ferry building views. I personally love the fried teriyaki chicken sandwich which is in my opinion better than Bakesale Betty in Oakland. The garlic fries are legit. The California burger has a fried egg, bacon and arugula... basically I've never had a bad meal here. Best part?! Plenty of outdoor/indoor seating options.

This is just for the ice cream - Friendly service but steep prices given the portion sizes. The menu offers a handful of flavors and toppings are an extra $1. I ordered a small sweet cream and it tasted really good, but I think I'll try a different place next time.

I knew I needed to give this place a try when my coworker mentioned that Gott's is one of his favorite burger joints in San Francisco! I finally had the courage to visit the Ferry Building on a Thursday afternoon and of course we were still greeted by a long wait. Luckily the wait here goes by pretty quick and there are plenty of seating areas to hang out at. I ordered the California Burger with Sweet Potato Fries and it was such an amazing combination! The burger tasted heavenly with the fat slabs of bacon in between the two buns and dipped with honey mustard. The sweet potato fries were also quite addicting and I was able to eat all of it in one sitting. Seriously worth the calories! I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to try the Horchata Milkshake and Poke Tacos next time. I'll also be sure to visit the gym in the morning beforehand. :)

I like how creative this place can be. I got the kimchee burger without the fried egg, yes I know, who does that??? The kimchee was actually good, and complimented the burger. Of course I had to also get an order of garlic fries. They were garlicky, crispy and hot when I got them, and they were even better dipping them in the natural ketchup. Everything I have tried here, whether it was the fried chicken sandwich, to the salad, brussell sprouts or their roasted corn, it has all been good. You can tell they use higher end meats and the quality is good. That also means the price is a little higher for the good quality. Plus, who wouldn't like to people watch on the Embarcadero??

Located at the san francisco ferry terminal this place is bustling with activity. We were looking for somewhere to eat on a Sunday afternoon before catching the ferry and this was one of the only places open. They have a kids menu so that was another positive. You walk in and order at the counter. Took about 20 minutes to get our food- pick up at the other end of the counter. Lots of family style and 4 person tables. I had the chicken teriyaki sandwich. My husband had a burger and so did my daughter. The chicken sandwich tasted like a chicken sandwich- nothing exceptional. The burgers are done pink in the middle which my daughter did not care for. The fries were okay. Not something i would have again but it satisfied a need.

This place is was open until 10pm on a Thursday night, so we came in starrrrrving to death, ordered some Mahi Mahi fish tacos & sweet potato fries, and everything was good! Our food came out fast, the KETCHUP & MUSTARD they carry here is very unique & AMAZING!! (Trust me, just freaking try it!!) The outdoor seating was great, plenty of open tables, everything was clean, and it was so nice to eat & hang out on the patio because it felt like it was 75 degrees there last night!!Our friends ordered a salad & milkshake, they enjoyed their food too! Great place if you're in the area & aha in.. It's open late!!

August 26, 2017 I have been to this location many times and when it was called Taylor's Refresher and to their original location on HWY 29. The food has always been solid. On this occasion an avocado burger was ordered and we were disappointed about the small amount of avocado. I hope this gets addressed.

The food was great, and substituting turkey for the beef patty and lettuce for the bun was a great move to feel less guilty about eating a burger! Garlic fries were awesome too (though still nothing beats the ones from ATT park!). Only downside was that the line was pretty long and slow. Just get there before 6:30pm if you're trying to do dinner! Also if you sit outside, beware of pigeons that will literally graze your feet while you're eating. :/

Gott's Roadside is located inside the Ferry Building (which is a fun place to check out, especially on weekends!). We came here on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't too busy. I ordered a Cheeseburger that came out in under 10 minutes, and we sat outside to enjoy the beautiful and often-taken-for-granted California weather. The Cheeseburger was delicious and definitely 4-star worthy, but it was a little on the small side; it seems like I finished the burger in 5 normal bites, which wasn't worth the ~$10 price tag (after tax). The other burgers that our group ordered didn't seem that large either, and they were more expensive than my burger.I do recommend trying this place if you're craving burgers though, especially if you're not too hungry.

Decent and quick place to go for lunch! Came here with my co workers for lunch one day, we wanted somewhere close by and fast. Line was pretty long when we got there, but moved super fast! This place is pretty poppin, a lot of locals and tourist come here.I decided to keep it light and ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos. They are more known for their milkshakes and burgers, however the tacos did not disappoint. I really enjoyed it and love how crunchy and tasty it was! It was a tad salty for me though. I have tried their milkshakes before and I recall it being pretty good also!

Hip hip hooray for Gott's!I've been to several locations, several times and it just never disappoints. I love their staff, their food, their wine - everything!I recently packed a sad desk lunch and decided it was of course, pathetic. I decided to walk down to the Ferry Building and indulge in a little impromptu solo lunch and it was the best decision ever. I didn't get there until about 12:30 which was a mistake because there was a hearty line at this point, but it was a beautiful day so I wasn't bothered.I decided to indulge in the ahi poke crispy tacos...OMG. I would enter an eating contest if this was the food provided. They were so good! The tuna was amazing, the veggies were fresh, the tortilla wasn't soaking in grease and the sauce just brought it all together.I honestly can't recall if I've ever had more than a bite of any of their burgers since the mahi mahi fish & chips used to be my favorite, but oh man - these tacos may be the new #1 pick when I go to Gott's. YUM.

This is a delicious place, in a super cool area of town. It's part of a pretty large market, and is a lot of fun to enjoy just being out in the open air eating (or inside if you prefer). I know I tried a few different foods here, and definitely liked them all. I will gladly come back by.

Gott's is one of the, if not THE, more affordable dining options at the Ferry Building.We were in a rush to catch a show that night, and most things close after 6PM in the Ferry Building in terms of food, anyways...so I got a Gott's chile burger (with veggie patty, for all my veg eaters!) to go...and brought it over to Fort Point's area to enjoy it with some suds.I loved the veggie patty! Most places are stepping up their veggie patty game, and I think Gotts' is a bit above standard. It's got more of a potato vibe to it, with small chunks of veggie inside, but mainly latke-like. They also serve beer and desserts, and the whole format is easy and quick whether you're here with a large group (I saw groups of school kids on a trip here) or just by yourself. You order at the cashier (and they thought ahead! there are menus outside too so you're ready to order by the time you get to the front), pick up at the pick-up station on the other end, and get the condiments that you need on both entrypoints of the diner. This Gott's is clean, modern, and spacious...with lots of seating for all group sizes. I took mine to go to enjoy it in another part of the Ferry Building, and brought it back to Gott's after I was done eating from their tray. Great spot for a quick burger/bite

Gott's has a lot more going on than I expected. It really isn't just burgers ... although they do those pretty well.I've now been to Gott's a couple of times, and I'm pleased to report there is a nice selection of sides, salads, and desserts (yea milkshakes!) to choose from. I've enjoyed the spicy tomato soup, the fish tacos, and the cobb salad - which came loaded with goodies on top. I'm also a big fan of the different types of fries here, and the sauces you can get with them. To add, the place is bright and clean, and the service is fast and friendly. As far as counter service goes, the staff is pretty attentive - and they're quick about cleaning up your table or offering extra napkins as well. Plus, you can catch most major sports games here, as they have a handful of TVs scattered around. Definitely a great, affordable, casual option when hanging around SoMa or Ferry Plaza.

Nom nom nom!I love stopping in at Gott's whenever I'm near the Ferry Building. Their food is awesome!Check out their Gluten-free Bacon Cheeseburger -- yum! It has a generous portion of blue cheese and thick bacon strips, plus a well done meat patty.Another tasty treat if you're gluten-free is their French Fries. What makes them gluten-free is that they are prepped in soy oil : )If you're a veggie lover, order their Cobb Salad. It's ginormous!! And delicious!! It has generous portions of avocado, egg, chicken, bacon bits, tomatoes, and lettuce.Another awesome salad that they serve is the Seasonal Salad -- Arugula with Almond Slivers, Strawberries, Goat Cheese, and Vinaigrette.I just LOVE burger places that serve amazing burgers AND also serve amazing salads : )Drinks are great too. I've had an Arnold Palmer (try to say that fast three times : ) and a milkshake of the day, which was a *zesty* Lemon Zest Shake.

Located in the Ferry building, Gotts offers a unique array of hamburgers,hotdogs and fries while having a beautiful view outside of the Embarcadero.I can here with two of my friends before going to the exploratorium and we each got sometime pretty amazing. My friend got the ahi poke tacos while I got their very popular garlic fries, and they are one of the best garlic fries Iv ever had!!The ahi poke tacos were very good, the avocado paired with the fish was a amazing combination.The garlic fries were very crunchy and had the right amount of garlic and was a good amount of food for the price I paid.Overall Gotts is a great place to eat if ur looking for a quick bite to eat before going to work or during your lunch break, or even to bring your friends for a hangout (they have a huge selection of beer, red and white wine), a must try for everyone!

I came here on August 4th just after Gott's opened to try the Impossible Burger. The burger is $10.99 and any burger on their menu can be made with an Impossible Burger. Ben was very helpful, answered all of my questions, and made the atmosphere quite cheerful!As for the burger, it was amazing! The Impossible Burger is by far the best veggie burger I have ever tasted. The price is the lowest at Gott's as well (normally at other establishments it is priced at sixteen dollars). In addition, any burger on Gott's menu can be made with the Impossible Burger. I cannot wait to come back to San Francisco and try the burger once again.Also, I noticed that some people (such as YJ) had problems with the Impossible Burger at Gott's because it was not completely vegan. If you read about the Impossible Burger online, the concept of the burger is not that it is vegan, but rather than meat-like burgers can be created with plant products in order to reduce the ecological impact on our environment. The Impossible Burger is made more so for environmental reasons and not necessarily because it fits with vegan and vegetarian diets. I would HIGHLY recommend people to email or call Gott's first to ask about options for bread and secret sauce before coming here.

I am absolutely in love with this place! The firm had our going away lunch for one of the coworkers here today. We arrived at 2pm and there was no line! The person who took all of our orders was friendly and patient. If you want to avoid the long lunch lines, definitely come around 2pm and onwards. The restaurant has plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. The place was very well lit as they have giant glass windows that allow a lot of natural lighting in. We opted to sit outside. They have a lot of picnic style tables and a few square ones that seat up to four people. The picnic style tables are huge! Just one table fit all 15 people in our group! Food was ready very quickly. Maybe about a 15 minute wait. I ordered the California burger cut in half with garlic fries and an Arnold Palmer. The California burger is just your regular burger but it has arugula instead of salad, bacon, and a fried egg on top! The burger patty was juicy, bacon was crispy and had a generous amount, and the egg just took the burger over the top. Garlic fries were crunchy and seasoned well. My Arnold Palmer was perfect! Usually people put more lemonade than tea so it comes out sweeter because all you taste is the lemonade. Not here at Gott's! The balance between tea and lemonade was perfect! The place is a little bit pricey but I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area.

Gott's has some seriously prime real estate. It's a beautiful location @ the Ferry Building with ample indoor & outdoor seating. I stopped in before going to the Exploritorium After Dark and it was a perfect dinner for the evening. Burger was good & cooked well. A bit pricy (but that's expected in the area for sure)! Garlic fries were reallyyy good tho! I liked the fries more than my burger I think!

This was my first time eating at the Ferry Building, and Gott's was not a bad way to start. Lines here get ridiculously long during peak lunch hours, but just come before noon and you'll be fine. They have a great variety of choices on their menu. You'll find burgers, sandwiches, salads, tacos, fries, fish n chips, etc. Once you place your order at the front, you get a buzzer thing that will light up and vibrate when your food is ready. It took 15 min for my food to come out. A little on the slow side, but still bearable. They have a great outdoor seating area, and there's often live music playing nearby. Great vibe!As for food, I got the Texas Burger (without jalapenos), and it was delicious! Loved the avocado and cheese combination, and the meat was cooked perfectly as well. Also got a side of garlic fries, and they were amazing!! Lots of good garlic flavor and the texture of the fries was perfect. Their ketchup is good too! All in all, I had a great experience here! Will definitely be back. Just not around peak lunch hour :)

Really liked the Crispy Teriyaki Chicken sandwich. I pulled off the peppers but they left behind just the right amount of heat. Burger was good. French fries weren't the greatest but ok. The high fructose free gmo free ketchup is awful. Free Coke refills a plus. Needs a pant job on the celling and some minor maintenance here and there.

If you are wandering around the Embarcadero near the Ferry Building and are looking for a bite to eat, Gott's may be a good option. It's mainly about burgers and fries and stuff that goes with burgers and fries (salads, beer, shakes, ...). They have a lot of burger options and even have a pretty good veggie patty. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, mostly at long, shared tables. The line to order can get pretty long during the lunch rush, but it's pretty good if you have the time.

The food is fabulous here! American classics such as hot dogs and burgers, but they did have a kimchee burger on their menu which you won't find in many places in my experience anyways. Great selection of beer too! Usually a line to wait in to order your food, but it goes fast and their food is worth the wait. Also plenty of seating inside so it's a great place to eat compared to the casual restaurants along Fishermans Wharf. They have a soft ice cream next door, but we opted for Humphries ice cream. If I were to go back, I would not order the kimchee burger, too salty for my taste and order their hot dog and garlic fires and sweet potato fries. I could their fries all day long!!!

Came around 7pm. Luckily I found a seat inside because people were getting up but there's also a lot of seats outside too. It's pretty crowded but they have 2 registers for food and beer & on register on the other side of the restaurant for beers and milkshakes. Lines get pretty long (out the door) around 7 but it gets better after 8. I ordered around 7 & it took around 15 minutes for the food to come out. -Green Chile Burger 4/5On top of the patty is a large charred green chile, it brings great flavors to the burgers and they add onions, and lettuce. It was very good. After finishing it I wanted more. -Garlic fries 3/5When I first got them I noticed how green they are. They add a lot of herbs but the garlic taste is the perfect amount, not overbearing.-Brussel sprouts 5/5My favorite. They roast it perfectly, every bite has the best crunch. They serve it with a sauce on the side, it's delicious!!! -Onion rings 4/5I liked the onion rings better than the garlic fries. They used a batter that was absolutely great. The crunch is the best and when it gets colder it doesn't get soggy. Great to dips with their ***house made ketchup! -Teriyaki chicken sandwich 1/5 When you hear teriyaki you think of a glaze with a pineapple on top. This chicken was fried and I couldn't taste the teriyaki at all. The toppings reminded me of a Vietnamese sandwich. I did no enjoy it very much.

Should have ordered a burger instead of the ahi tacos, but the fries were hot and the beer was cold so in my eyes I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The only thing wrong with the tacos was the shells, they were bland and also tasted stale. Next time im in the area i will order a burger

This is so nice that I work at Ferry Building. Thus, sometimes the firm order food on it.The Citrus Avocado Salad was so good. It has chicken, lots of salad, baby tomatoes, quinoa, black bean....Very goodVietnamese Chicken Salad is also good.In addition, they have trendy by having lettuce wrap burger so if you are in the mood no bun, you can substitute by the lettuce wrap. Very good. I usually order a salad box and lettuce wrap hamburger!!!!Tomato soup is also good The line is always long during weekday lunch time however the food was serve fast enough. Very nice seat outdoor during warm weather. Also, as i usually dont have to pay for it so nothing to complain. 5 stars

Five stars for their soft serve! I've never tried their food, yet as there are people waiting in a long line most of the time, especially during lunch time.

Ordered a black and white month milkshake and it was creamy, smooth, and chocolatey. Mmm! It was pretty crowded when we went on a Saturday. Wait time was under 10 minutes though.

Great food and convenient location. Fun for couples, groups, or families. Ambiance: Open and sunny! It can be a little tricky to find seating if it's cold outside and you have a large group.Food: -Ahi burger: loved everything about this burger. Generous ahi portion and delicious bun. The slaw complemented the tuna and was dressed perfectly. -Kimchi burger: lots of flavor in this one! -Garlic fries: these were awesome. Perfectly crispy and full of flavor! Service: Friendly staff! The line moves quickly.

Came here on Sunday around 6pm no lines which was a plus. We ordered the Onion rings, Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, Cheeseburger, & Cobb Salad. The best choice was the salad loved the citrus dressing they use had just the right amount of ingredients. Teriyaki sandwhich was yummy loved the fried chicken if your not a fan of spicy i would recommend holding off on the fresh jalapeno slices i love spicy but thought it was too overpowering for the sandwhich. Now my all time favorite food is cheeseburgers I will say there wasn't anything special about this one. If i came back I would probably come just for the salad alone. Wish i got to try their dipped cone from but unfortunately they were already closed when i was ready for dessert :(

Yes, there will be a line but it moves pretty fast and worth the wait. The Ahi Poke Crispy Tacos are excellent and a great value compared to the crazy prices all over San Francisco. The garlic fries are great too. Add an Anchor Stream beer and you've got an afternoon off to a great start! Not a fancy place but it's fun to sit at the picnic tables outside and people watch.

I've always seen this spot, but recently (twice actually) came here to eat lunch. Being close to the Ferry Building I know how busy it gets (especially during lunch time) because of all the foot traffic from the tourists. I would highly recommend ordering the food online before hand, or calling and ordering since it the line to this spot goes out the door and to the street a lot! Anyways I ordered a California burger with a onion rings. It was absolutely fantastic. The onion rings were crispy and went well with their secret sauce. The burger was very good. I'm a sucker for burgers with a fried egg and everything just goes well together. The staff was friendly and if you decide to eat there it always has a great view. Highly recommend checking this one. It is a little pricey (lunch comes out to anywhere from $15-20 bucks), but once in a while it's good to treat yourself!

For a touristy spot, I do have to say they have great food and a great beer selection. I ended up getting the chicken tenders and fries, and they were delicious. The beer was great as well, but I forgot the name since it was a house special for the weekend. The only downside is the wait. Because this is at the Ferry Building and is a touristy spot, the line can get ridiculous. If you get here early enough or don't mind the wait...then it is a good find...would come back again if in the area.

Summary - great place to grab a beer and a burger in the sunshine at the Ferry Building. Can get pricey.. Typical burger-fry-shake-beer-salad joint that does all of them better than average. The burgers are reliably done very well. Usually my better half and I explore their vast array of burger options coupled with their garlic fries. They have options they post at the registers that aren't to miss - often it's good stuff like Mexican street corn and crispy brussel sprouts. The only issue I've encountered is when I ordered a chicken teriyaki sandwich. The toppings on the sandwich and flavor were great, but someone took the liberty of dumping teriyaki sauce all over the sandwich that leaked all over the place. It's hit or miss, but it's worth the try. Mentioned it in passing and received a sincere apology from the servers.Expect it to run about $20-$25 per person for a burger, a drink, and a side. An order for a group of four could easily hit $100.I highly recommend checking this place out. Don't let the line intimidate you. Place an order, grab a beer or a milkshake, and enjoy the people watching.

Standard pub food. Got the bacon cheeseburger and I have to say it's overpriced for the meal. You also have to buy fries and a drink separate as they don't do combos. Got the blueberry raspberryfreeze which was delicious! $7 and my friend got a beer for $7. Burger and fries came up to about $15 Pretty expensive meal there... I must say, in n out is probably better. Lots of seating though and pretty spacious. Plus you get to people watch while you eat by the water.

When all hopes fail, food redeems. With the depressing outcome of the election, I have no other choice than to take it to the tastebuds to save my day. Stress eating? Hell to the yes. And there's no better place to lift up my crappy day than a place where I could nom on some greasy dishes.That's when Gott's Roadside come to the rescue. I met up with a girlfriend there around dinner time and got the crispy teriyaki chicken burger along with half of a turkey burger and garlic fries. Even if my day was crappy, the food there helps to make everything a little better. Out of everything that I got, the crispy chicken burger was my favorite. I'm not a huge fan of burgers, but that dish was amazing. Their cookies and cream shake was also a cherry on top of it all. As for their ambience, this place is fitting for all sorts of occasion. Their indoor section is filled with ample seatings for those who need a shelter from the elements of the weather. But since I'm a bit of an claustrophobe, I love that they also have an outdoor patio. For health concerns, I probably won't be frequenting this place again anytime soon, but the next time I'm in need of a quick greasy fix, I'll be sure to pay Gott's another visit.

I've had Gott's Roadside burgers a few times. The key to this chain's success is consistency. The burgers are consistently good with plenty of ingredients and popping with taste. The sweet potato fries must be ordered every time, and they are consistently crisp and delicious. If I'm ever craving a good hearty burger with sweet potato fries, Gott's will be my top choice.I also love that they have recycling and compost bins at every corner, making it easy for patrons to separate their leftovers and contribute to sustainable eating.

To be honest, this one cannot compare to the Gott's in NAPA! This one is kinda mediocre, the one in NAPA is surprisingly good, the meat tastes more juicy and tasty in the NAPA one. Why is it different? Is it because the location is too good and don't worry about customers at all? I guess. But the good thing is they have a big screen and very good outside dining area, it is my first dining in SF when I came to SF alone to meet a persons kinda had my memory. Overall I appreciate the location and the dining environment more than the food.

I went here for dinner today with my partner. We were excited to go because we heard they started serving Impossible Burger- a completely plants-based burger that is served at select restaurants throughout the country. We love Impossible Burger and believe in supporting non-vegan businesses that are are starting to be environmentally friendly, ethical, and inclusive. We came to Gotts in support of that. There is an assumption with the Impossible Burger that as a vegan burger, it will be offered as a vegan option in the select restaurants that offer it. Cockscomb, Jardiniere, and Kronnerburger are all restaurants who have designed an Impossible Burger that vegans can eat. FYI- if it's vegan, it can also be consumed by carnivores. If some of it is not vegan, then ALL of it is not vegan and must be modified to become vegan. I wanted the Impossible Burger here. We waited in their long ass line super hungry. When we got to the counter, we asked if the bun was vegan. Nope, not vegan. Do they have any vegan buns? Nope. Do they have vegan mayo? Nope. They offered to put it on slices of sourdough bread with mustard and ketsup. I didn't feel like eating a dry Impossible sandwich with acidic sauces so I told my partner that we should go somewhere else that offered a vegan Impossible Burger. The cashier said he would go back and double check if they could make a vegan burger, which we thought was nice.He came out with some guy who offered us the same dry Impossible sandwich that I had declined before. I told him that I was under the impression that the burger had a vegan option. He told me that Gotts is not a vegan restaurant, then condescendingly told me that the marketing strategy of Impossible Foods is to not market it to vegans. I told him that if they have a vegan burger but no vegan options of eating the burger, then it's not vegan. I already ate a vegan sandwich for lunch today. I was trying to eat a burger tonight. The guy would not concede that his dry Impossible sandwich is not welcoming for vegans. He insisted that because they could do that, they are vegan friendly.I hate to break it to you, but Gotts is not vegan friendly and has no deliberately designed vegan options. They even put cheese on their watermelon. San Francisco commonly has vegan options in non-vegan restaurants that are not modifications, replacements, and hacked together sides. I happily went to one of them and won't be returning. Vegans, BEWARE.

Got the vietnamese salad. Being from the east coast wasnt used to so much cilantro in my salads but it was alright. Dressing was on the lighter side even for a peanut based dressing one, which i appreciated. The vegetables that comprised the salad were very fresh and juxtaposed the deeply fried chicken filet that was placed on top of them. Enjoyed very much even whilst watching everybody else eat their artery clogging burgers and mexican street corn.

Despite the long ass line here, the food is merely mediocre at best and extremely expensive. There's a lot of seating here although with all the families going through it can be very messy. I wasn't wowed by anything here and we ordered a lot of food. Yeah, you can come here and get a burger but there are other cheaper and tastier places.

Actual rating: 3.5 Stars.Solid burger. I got the California burger because - fried egg. Also ordered the garlic fries which were delicious while they were hot, but if you don't devour them right away and let them get cold, the garlic gets a little strong. I was a little self conscious walking around afterwards with my garlic breath wafting. The only reason the rating isn't higher is because I think the price point is a little high. $13 for the burger (though admittedly the most expensive burger on the menu), plus the garlic fries, with no drink brought me close to $20. I tipped $2, but picked up my food at the counter and bussed my own tray. While a nice thing to do, tipping probably isn't necessary.

Never got to try the Napa location so I was happy when I started working in FiDi and found out how close this place was. Located right at the Embarcadero it makes it easy to get to and there's tons of indoor/outdoor seating. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the garlic fries. The burger didn't blow me out of the water and was smaller than expected, but it was still tasty. The burgers are a little greasier than I expected as well. The fries however were SOOO GOOD. Garlic fries are a weakness and I must say they paired very well with the burger. Would highly recommend this place since it's in a great location, fast service, and filling food. Will try the shakes next time!

Totally average. Okay maybe slightly above average.The burgers (double cheeseburger and bacon cheeseburger) were both okay. We asked them to be cooked medium and the double cheeseburger was overcooked. Overall, not very juicy and bacon wasn't crisp. I'm a huge fan of super duper burgers and this one just lacked flavor and the bun/burger/toppings ratio was off. Sweet potato fries were delicious (I hated that fries weren't included with a $10 burger btw) and service was just OK. I've had their fro yo before which is delicious but honestly, I wouldn't come here again for a burger-- I actually don't understand why the lines are always so long. Nice and ample outdoor seating and they serve beer/wine. Their hot sauce is also HOT (I wasn't expecting the heat but it's a great hot sauce for spicy fans).

I stopped by for a good burger and some of the best chili cheese fries ever. The location is super convenient, right by the ferry building. The prices aren't too bad, especially for the location. Be warned, unless you tell them, they will cook your burger medium rare so if you want it a different way, mention it to them. The seating can be a little tricky, they have community style tables so it can be hard to get privacy.

For the record, I don't usually enjoy hamburger joints.I thought Gotts was lively and cheerful.After a long day in the city it was nice to have a reasonably priced restaurant by the ferry that is open lateThe garlic fries were good and the garden burger was decent.The staff who appear underpaid are exceptionally hard working customer service representatives.Hopefully this place will continue doing what it does best.

Celiacs/gluten intolerant beware, this place offers gluten free options but you have to be careful. My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch, we were starving. It is hard for me to eat out due to the fact that I have celiacs disease. I saw on findmeglutenfree.com that this place would be safe but you have to watch or have a manager follow the food. After we ordered our food, We sat at the bar area watching them prepare our food. I noticed that the woman and man doing the fryer were touching gluten and breading other foods but not changing gloves. This made me feel uncomfortable!! We had ordered their garlic fries which could be made in a dedicated gluten free fryer along with their fried Brussels sprouts and their delicious butternut squash soup with everything not he side was gluten free as well. My husband got a plain. hamburger with bbq sauce on the side. However, the food prep made me feel uncomfortable because how they were cross contaminating. When our buzzer buzzed, I told the women who was giving out the food that I have a serious allergy to gluten and my husband and I saw them bread chicken, and put onion rings in a different basket and touch it with the same gloves and then handle our food. They had the manager remake my food, which I did eat and enjoyed. I cannot in good faith recommend this place for fries or anything fried because they do not do it safely and despite saying they have a dedicated fryer, it is not really that dedicated when they do not change their gloves or have a single person be in charge of gluten free by changing gloves and only do that since even though the manager had done it, I did get a little sick early this morning. I should of known better but it is what it is. The food overall was good and thats why I took two stars off because of the gluten issue. I am not sure if I will be back.

You're paying tourist prices for mostly decent food that comes out extremely slowly, no matter how busy they are. I've had good food here and they have a large menu with a lot of stuff that looks delicious (I love the elote), but I've ordered burgers with bacon that is super fatty and undercooked and once came in for an afternoon snack (elote and french fries) that took 20 minutes to come out despite the place being a dead zone. I've also come across super surly employees more often than not; if I'm paying tourist prices, give me the tourist experience. You don't have to sing and dance, but maybe just avoid radiating outright hatred at people picking up their food.

I forgot about Gott's here in SF, yesterday i walked over with a co worker and it was her first time here. Instead of getting a burger i decieded to get the Ahi Tuna tacos, best ahi tuna ever! They were delicious! She got the A-BLT with sweet potato fries and said her food was very tasty. I will definetly go back for those tacos and try more off their menu.
