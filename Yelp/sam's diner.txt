Casual diner next to the Orpheum theater, serving up so many different fares that it gets sort of overwhelming, SAM's Diner is a good place to get food before or after a show, the library, or even before getting on BART!My co-workers and I came here on a Wednesday lunch after a forum, and we were seated after about 10 minutes of waiting. It was fine though, because the posters from all the previous shows at the Orpheum were signed so it gave us time to talk about which shows we had or hadn't seen.When it came time to order, at least three of us had a tough time choosing between one food option or the other- with the menu boasting things from breakfast classics like eggs benedicts, to brunch specials like stuffed french toast, to lunch fare like korean beef bulgogi tacos, to various sliders and sandwiches, and even honey fried chicken- how does one make up their mind?!All jokes aside, I went for the lunch entree version of the country fried steak. The breakfast version comes with sausage gravy, your choice of potatoes, eggs your way, and choice of bread, while the lunch version comes with brown gravy, mashed potatoes, and sauteed veggies. Being a breakfast girl who loves her mashed potatoes, I went for the lunch version, but asked for sausage gravy on the steak. They were able to accommodate me (bless SAM's), and I can vouch for my co-workers when I say we left the place pretty happy.I'm totally returning if I'm ever in the area again!

A great pre-show place. It gets BUSY, so arrive early. Consistently excellent "diner food." Great club sandwiches and bacon cheeseburgers, but the standout we discovered tonight, is the Korean Bulgogi Beef Sandwich. A seriously excellent sandwich. (The Bulgogi Beef Tacos also sound good)I've learned that if we arrive by 6:50 PM on a Thursday, we're seated by 7:00 and will be out the door by 7:30 or so.

Conveniently located right down the street from Orpheum if you want to grab a bite to eat before catching your show. I was mesmerized by all the signed broadway posters on their walls, mentally checking off the ones I've seen. Don't mind the group of homeless people hanging around the side of the building and ignore that smell. It gets pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long. I love the fact that they offer tater tots with their breakfast entrees. They have an extensive menu and even some "enlightened" ones for those looking to stay on the healthier side. My mom ordered the enlightened scramble which costs about $12-$15. It was not worth that much. It literally looked like a kid's plate. Not sure what their definition of "enlightened" meals, but I assumed it meant cooked healthier, not quantity lighter. On the contrary, I ordered the breakfast sandwich with avo and tater tots. BOMB! The tater tots were crispy and the sandwich wasn't dry, but on the oily side for sure. This is the type of place to go to for the convenience but not because it's something you have to try! It isn't bad.

Great place for dinner if you're trying to catch a show at the Orpheum theatre. It gets pretty crowded so definitely come early to snag a table. They only seat you when the entire party arrives, but you can sit at the bar. I enjoyed my golden beet salad, and was surprised by how large the portion was. The beef chilli soup was pretty damn good as well. So was the hot chocolate (yes, I order like a kid) topped with whipped cream. Yum.Recommended!

We visited here early Sunday morning before the Pride celebration started and got a seat immediately! Lucky us I guess and I can only imagine that it was to be hugely packed as the day went on. Our waiter immediately asked us what we wanted to drink and then promptly delivered our drinks. Ordered food off the menu and we both had the biscuits and gravy plate. Very delicious and was quick to get that food out to us. The only drawback is that you can't get lunch in the morning like some other places we've been to but not going to take any stars away from this, just needed a place to eat dinner before heading out to pride. Would go here again, and would love to try the lunch when we're in the area going shopping or whatever.

Anyway the breakfast there at Sam's diner really good to the brioche French toast looks wonderful I had to over easy sausage biscuits and gravy it was really good too . anyway stop in at some coffee it's a good stop.

I am going to give Sam's Diner 4 stars. My wife and I have been there twice now before going to the Orpheum Theater. The interior has been updated to a modern vibe. The menu is extensive and everyone should find something to their liking. On our first visit I had their fish & chips. They were some of the best I have had. My wife had the beet salad and was pleased with her choice. Today I had the spicy pork burrito. The flavor was good. My only issue was that there was too much rice in the burrito. I think it would taste a bit better and be more healthy if there was less rice and maybe some coleslaw inside for some crunch and flavor. Or maybe have it come with a small green salad. My wife had The Cobb salad. This was a bit disappointing. The salads was more of a glorified green salad. It did come with hard boiled egg, avocado and bits of bacon. It was missing the traditional ham & turkey for the extra protein. This is still a great place to go and I recommend that you give it a try. I think there is just some menu options that need some improvement.

I ordered the Giants burger and it wholly exceeded my expectations (5/5). It was a lot bigger, juicer, and more amazing than the my picture suggests -- poor angle on my part but my hands were too messy to retake once I got into it! It comes with two types of cheese, avo, mushrooms, bacon, lettuce / tomato, and a chipotle aioli; plus the bun was A+. I also asked for it cooked medium and it came out as such :) The fries were fresh and thin cut, probably a 4/5. The onion rings were also decent, probably a 3.5/5. I agree with other Yelp reviews that this place is on the pricy side ($17 for the burger, $7 for a plate of onion rings), but it makes sense considering it's right by the BART station and the Orpheum theater. The place is clean and waiting staff was also really friendly, always a plus. Drop by if you want to meet a friend near the BART station! It's literally right outside the exit.

What a gem Sam's is. A half a block up from the Orpheum, it is now our go-to pre-show dinner locale. We'd heard about Sam's for a while but was always late in making a reservation on a show night. Taking a chance this last time, I arrived very early, before the rush. The gentleman who greeted me and said "no problem" to my request for a table for four at 6pm turned out to be the chef himself, Neil Marquis. His pleasant and welcoming demeanor was matched throughout the restaurant. Our server, Nick, could not have been more helpful, accommodating, or fun. He engaged with us and provided excellent advice and service. And upon learning one of us was celebrating a very special birthday, he brought out an amazingly delicious bread pudding a la mode, along with a candle, a smile, and a song.And, oh yeah, the food was excellently prepared and very tasty too ;-). My wife had the Korean beef tacos that were yummy. My pork chop was perfection!So if you haven't tried Sam's before - go! Just don't take our table on a show night ;-).

Excellent, creative menu, warm, friendly, fast service and a great place to eat before going to the theater. Extra points for their Hamilton themed dishes! It is obviously a very popular place - they were totally packed and had folks lined up outside the door, but they squeezed in our party of two and got us to the theater in time.

Got an early dinner here with my brother after classes at UCSF because I didn't want to be hangry on the hour BART ride back to the East Bay.Food was pretty good, I got the bacon macaroni and cheese and my brother got the bulgogi sandwich. I also got a house salad with my meal. The house salad wasn't really memorable but it also wasn't the worst restaurant salad that I've had. I really enjoyed the bacon macaroni and cheese because there was also added cheese on top (not good for my lactose intolerance but amazing for my taste buds). I also ended up adding the hot sauce they had on the table to cut down a little on the richness of the macaroni and cheese (a personal preference to try and trick my body into thinking it's getting less cheese than I'm actually shoveling in). My brother's sandwich was also really good and would be something that I would try on my next visit (that or the bulgogi burrito). We also got the decadent chocolate cake (mainly because I saw a table across from us get it and I immediately knew I also needed it). The cake was amazing and slightly fudge-y with whip cream, vanilla ice cream, and raspberry sauce on the plate as wellThe seating is also not huge, which can become more noticeable if there is a show going on in the nearby theater because you can make dinner reservations. However, they do also have bar seating if you're not super inclined to be sitting directly across from whomever you're with. Also, when they're slammed it does take a little bit longer to catch a waiter's attention. However, they also ensure you get your food in a timely manner so it wasn't a huge annoyance.

TLDR: great place for food near theaters. Accepts reservations and food comes out quick! Reasonable prices. This place is the perfect location to grab a bite to eat before heading to the Orpheum or Golden Gate theaters. We were a group of 6 attending brunch here before the Saturday 2pm showing of Hamilton. Since it's become insanely harder to find a place that does brunch reservations on a Saturday we were pleasantly surprised to see this place did and had something available 4 days before the show. Originally for 11:45 we had to call an hour before and change to 12:30pm and they were accommodating without hesitation. We all got right in at 12:30. This place is smaller, holding maybe 30 guest but it was very cute inside. The prices were great and the food quality was very good. Can't go wrong with the breakfast tacos or Benedict. Letting them know you are going to the show helps and they get you your food super quick. This is our new go to!

Between the ridiculously slow service (over 35 minutes to get my cup of coffee while waiting for a BLT) and the rudeness of some of the staff, I'm through with Sam's.It's a shame because I work nearby and there are some weeks where I'd go to Sam's 6 days out of a week. Today, however, I wasted 45 minutes of my 60 minute break for food which STILL HADN'T ARRIVED. I ordered a BLT. Bacon and toast. Seriously, 45 minutes?!?!?Now I get to finish my 10 hour work day hungry because Sam's could efficiently fulfill it's only role; to feed people.I walked out and won't be coming back.

If you need time to kill and have a great meal Sam's is the best place. Being a fan of musical arts my family decided to spontaneously visit the Orpheum theatre. We ended up scoring tickets to Wicked for $40. Which was great but we had so much time to kill.We diverted from the appalling Burger King on Market St and walked further more. We stumbled onto Sam's and it was bustling with patrons. The menu is clearly posted in the front window. It is a tiny diner with so much to offer.We decided to stick to diner type food like the patty melt and a few burgers. It was delicious and really hit the spot! After dealing with SF traffic you get so hungry! This is a great place and service is so-so but hey it's pretty delicious.

Surprisingly good. We've lived across the street for over two years now and have always walked by sams thinking it's dirty like the streets it occupies outside. However we were pleasantly surprised! Everything was clean and the food was actually delicious. We got the Benedict, French toast, and chocolate chip pancakes. The prices are a little steep at 14-16 a plate but I gusss it's to accommodate all the tourists across the street. Overall we'd be back if we were craving something breakfast specific since they have a pretty good selection!

Can't be bothered to get drink orders right, doesn't want to do his job. Overheard him complaining about people being cheap today.

We come here all the time when we are loading in the shows at the Orpheum! Can't believe I have never reviewed!! Yikes. So here it goes. This is the Drivers choice for chow! Sometimes it's just us and sometimes 2 couples. It's always good here breakfast & lunch is our time. Today was the Mamas Korean Omelet with side of Kimchee. We wanted another side of Kimchee but we had the last... so sad. The omelets were fluffy and good melty provolone and the Korean flavored beef was fabulously sweet as it should be. Glad I saw this on the menu. It came with sides of potatoes and bread. Omg it's a lot of food. For the smaller appetites you must try It. Sharing would be in order unless you take some with to go. I have had the eggs bene and corned beef hash before and it's good too and plenty of food always!! So till next time. Oh our Serbian waitress we had last two times is very sweet and attentive!

The food is okay, a tad overpriced the service is a hit and miss. The last 2 times I've been here, I've had to get up and get my coffee/syrup (this was after asking for these items without results). Too much chitchat amongst the staff which results in customers being ignored. Another time I was shown to a table but had to get up and get a menu, I was unable to get any of the waitstaff's attention since their backs were to me all on their phones or talking to each other. I was just approached by 2 separate waitstaff, one to ask if I had ordered a cupcake, another to ask if I had all my food. The table across from me just received their food, what looked like a tuna melt sandwich on toast was sent back as it was cold. I just had a 2nd cup of coffee poured and it was cold!

The food was ok, if expensive. Diner is cute. Staff rather lax and inattentive. But what really colored our family dinner and prompted this review is the experience of being verbally accosted and physically threatened by a street lunatic while sitting in one of the booths and not ONE staff member noticed or intervened. It was loud and scary and left with the impression that SF is full of cowardly bystanders.

Although this isn't the best neighborhood (Tenderloin area), this is a nice little diner with good, fast food and good service. Outside is sketchy and I wouldn't want to walk around alone here at night. But inside, the menu features a good variety of choices. We didn't have a lot of time, but our food came out quickly and it was pretty tasty. Service was warm, friendly, and attentive.

Very disappointed today. The food and service here is usually pretty decent. Today, we arrived to join a small crowd waiting to get in. I asked if the two of us would be able to get in, order and eat before our 2pm show. The young woman smiled and said no problem, 15 minutes. This was at 12:20. At 1:05, I went in to remove ourselves from the wait list. I told her it was a very long 15 minutes. She apologized and told me that we were next.I eat out often enough to understand that a business cannot always guesstimate how long a guest will sit. At the same time, they have a responsibility to learn how to gauge realistically.The food here is good enough that we'll return in the future but never again with less than two hours before show time.

I stayed at the Hotel Whitcomb across the street and got a takeout order from them. I went to pick up my order and it smelled like pee (probably due to the homeless people outside) so I was very glad I didn't eat there. Got my order and got back to my hotel room and realized they didn't give me any utensils, napkins, syrup for my french toast, stirrers for my coffee. They also gave me brown sugar for my coffee (is that a thing? weird). So I was annoyed I had to go back and get all these things. So make sure you specifically ask for everything you need before you leave. Food was pretty good. I got a cheese omelette with home fries that was decent. My friend got the farmer's market and that was the real winner. Decent coffee. Nothing that spectacular, but would go back.

Updated review
Funny how many times I've come here late in the evening after work despite my initial reaction that it was a "rather dreary little place". The neighboring Burger King still attracts quite a campsite of homeless people, some agitated enough to make it something of a minefield to get to the front entrance of SAM's (all CAPS please). Nearly nine years ago, when I first tried this spot, it was a more Korean-oriented cafe with sullen servers and mediocre diner fare that obviously didn't leave a great impression on me. However, for some reason, I started coming back a couple of years ago to find the place under management. The brown naugahyde booths are still there as well as the unused counter, but the menu got bigger.The Korean tacos are accounted for, but the rest is much like Denny's redux. The other major improvement has been the attentive service. It appears to be making a big difference in business since the booths are often fully occupied with a microcosm of Market Street life from cops to hipsters with nose rings to armies of tourists representing most of Western Europe nation by nation. I don't look at the menu much since I've ordered the same thing over and over again, the $12 Classic Joe's Special with an additional dollar spent on sauteed mushrooms. It comes with sourdough toast and country potatoes, although I always ask for the hash browns as a substitute. They always oblige (photo: bit.ly/1A4u9ms).Truth be told, it doesn't compare with the Joe's Special served at the Soma Inn Cafe much less at Original Joe's, but it hits the spot anyway with the mix of ground chuck, spinach, onion and scrambled eggs. I squirt a lot of hot sauce on it and even use those little plastic containers of jelly on my toast. But last time, I did order the $12 SAM's Cobb Salad, which was pretty decent with avocado, bacon bits, cucumber, tomato, a hard-boiled egg, blue cheese crumbles and ham with ranch dressing on the side (photo: bit.ly/1znHe3D). It was hamstrung by a poor $4 cup of their soup du jour, French Onion that was missing the cheese and used salad croutons instead of a baguette slice (photo: bit.ly/1DVIvD1). All in all, it deserves another star just for the service upgrade.FOOD - 3 stars...still nothing special but better than my first visitAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...they put my wattage in their lighting but otherwise the same dinerSERVICE - 4 stars...here's where they got better, much betterTOTAL - 3 stars...sometimes Joe's Special is all you need at 9PM

The food was good but the manager's attitude was not. We ordered the rib eye medium but was brought out fully cooked. They took it back but it took too long and we had to leave for the play on time so we asked them to cancel it. The manager returned with the steak and tried to insist we take it and when we declined she gave us attitude. As we finished our drinks, she returned to the table and stuck herself in the middle of the table to clean up without a word, again with attitude all over her face. We had pulled out a cash tip for the waiter, but decided not to tip, even though the waiter was nice... because of her horrible attitude the 2nd time.

So after about a month of coming here weekly, this place never fails to deliver with their food and service.Food: 4 stars- the food is well prepared and could use a little more seasoning in my opinion, but otherwise everything tastes great, and they are very giving when it comes to portion size.Service: 5 stars easily. I come in the early morning when they open and Doug is by far the best sever I've seen in the industry. He always checks on you, gives you the specials of the day, offers coffee as soon as you walk in. Honestly, I can't comment on afternoon staff but if you ever meet him, you'll understand.Summary: hands down this joint is a hidden gem here in the market/civic center district. If you want honest, hearty food and superior service, you have to come here. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

My friends and I have been looking for a nice place to have lunch before attending plays at the Orpheum. Having eaten many times at the restaurant in the hotel across the street we wanted to find another place as the restaurant had changed its prices and menu. Someone recommended Sam's Diner and I'm glad I checked it out on Yelp. The great reviews and ratings, along with being able to make a reservation from the Yelp site, made our decision easy.First, if you are going to see a play at the Orpheum MAKE a reservation if you want to eat here. The restaurant is small/compact with about 20 booths and a long counter with seating. People were waiting outside the door and I saw many turn away rather than wait.You can order from the breakfast or lunch menu (there are specials for dinner). There are varied choices, our food was very good, and the service was excellent. Prices are good, too, especially for downtown SF.I overheard the hostess telling someone they had been open about one month after remodeling. The restaurant has a modern spartan-like look and is very clean. We will definitely be back here for lunch every time we head to the Orpheum.

Came here before seeing a late show at bill graham for dinner, and it was pretty much what we expected. Standard burgers (they are tasty and big), but they didn't really stand out compared to other burgers we have had before. Mine was a little different, it was the one with chicaquiles and avocado on top, which was yummy and different. However, we had a little bit of a snafu with our order; at first, I received the wrong order but was told it was what I had ordered. I took a bite, still sure it wasn't the burger I had ordered, only for our waiter to come back and tell me that it actually was not my order, so he took it away. A few minutes later, he did bring the burger I had ordered, but it was a little less fresh than the other one had been, and there was a greasy order receipt still on the plate when I got it. Then, however, we realized there was no avocado on my burger, even though that come standard with the order. Our waiter took it back again, and he brought back the same burger with a couple of slices tossed onto the burger and plate. I did eat it and it did taste good, but it could've been fresher and the service could've been better and more organized. We did end up getting 15% off our bill for all of the trouble, but I don't know if I would come back here without another reason to be in the area.

Friendly fast service. But the food is not remarkable at all. In fact, one of two pancakes was burned. Would not go back, there has got to be better places.

How often do you eat at the same restaurant night after night? Thai food can do that for me sometimes. But now, there's Sam's. Three nights in a row, and still going! I've tried something different each night, and every dish is a genuine home run. Prices are moderate and affordable. The staff is professional, engaged, warm and friendly. Steps away from the Civic Center train station, Sam's is a neighborhood oasis that you need to build a long term relationship with. Even if you're just here visiting.

The food was good, it wasn't great or anything I'd record as a memorable experience. Service was attentive and prompt. Couldn't understand what made this place so great from the reviews that it has vs my experience.

We were in San Francisco on business and stayed across from Sams. Had a fantastic breakfast. Will definitely be going back.

Not a bad spot to grab a bite after a show at the Orpheum theater. We were all very hungry and found this place on yelp. We also saw that we needed reservations for a party of 5 so I'm glad we checked online first. We were able to get one for after the show. Our waitress was nice and friendly. We all enjoyed our food, so much everything was gone. Either that or we were just that hungry! I had the marinated beef Korean tacos minus the spicy sauce. They were good. The Pico de Gallo made them a little messy, dripping down my wrist. So extra napkins were a must. The rice needed salt, but was good, especially with the extra drippings on the plate. Overall good place, decent food. There was a variety of choices, cause you know, it is a diner. Korean tacos, hamburgers and a burrito in our party. I'd eat here again.

We've grabbed a quick lunch here twice before shows at the Orpheum. Good food, quick and friendly service. We'll be back again for sure!

This is a must go to eats before watching a show. It's fast and it's very good. I have to say. We saw a line out in front and I said skip it because we don't want to miss the show. We'll look for another one around here. We went around for about 20 minutes and found nothing inviting. So, we decided to back and the line was gone. I said Okay. Let's take our chances. The show will start in an hour. There was a waiting lists. Yikes! It did not deter us of putting our name. Even though there was a party of 4 and 7 before us. I figured it's only two of us. So, I wrote my name on the list. While waiting, we browsed the menu. We were seated after 10 minutes. We ordered right away. Another 10 minutes and we got our order. I got Korean tacos (it's very good) and hash was good too. But need more meat on that. Hot spot for fast eats.

Nice place. The manager comp-ed the meal for the guy next me when he spilled his own water. Nice touch, good food.

Too expensive and they do something I hate: they add the gratuity in the check and then add the tip line on the cc slip. Don't. Just don't. Oh, and I episode have tipped you more than what you put, even though you're over priced.

Food was great! Had the chicken penne pesto, staff could be upgraded. Don't try Sam's hot wings, just not worth it!

I had a sausage patty and it was just ok. A bit too salty. Environment is ok, a bit less clean than I expected.

This place just happened to be across from where we were staying and we needed breakfast asap. This place exceeded my expectations as far as deliciousness goes! It's nothing fancy, kinda expensive, and pretty small. Despite this, we opted to go a 2nd time instead of trying a place next door for breakfast because it was that good. The waitstaff was super kind as well.

We didn't expect a lot out of this place since it's not in the best area, but I would not go here again under any circumstance. If you don't like flavor, service or cleanliness this is your place.

Excellent breakfast joint. Prices are a little high but that's not their fault. Thank the most liberal city in the country and its out of control taxes. Food is solid and wait staff world class. It's packed all the time because it's the best choice for bfast lunch in the civic center area. crazy Bernie has been coming to this location since the early 80's when it was Stevens Cafe. Same great food now. Big fan.

Wow, this place is terrible. Service, food and especially location. I met my friend here for lunch on a weekday (since the location is halfway between the Financial District and the Mission where she works), and I was surprised by the cleanly interior, but it only went downhill from there. Service staff was slow, confused, no one was actually assigned to our table and they didn't manage to take our drink order for 10+mins. Then after taking our order came back to tell us they were out of English muffins, and then somehow managed to get my order wrong. They literally FORGOT the meat in my omelette. But we had waited at least 35-40mins for food already, so I wasn't about to send it back. Tasteless, bland, small portions, high prices, wow everything I hate in a restaurant. Getting the check was a whole other battle... I give up, I'm not sure how this place is still in business but please don't support them.

Really liked this local joint! The service was fast and friendly, and the Korean tacos I had were messily scrumptious. I sat where I could see other dishes coming out, and they looked tasty, as well. If you're staying at a nearby hotel, I'd recommend coming here for breakfast, rather than the overpriced, under-quality hotel restaurant.

My experience was a unique one where I was in SF on a trip, and one morning, I woke up with a really really sore throat. The problem was, I was on a really important business trip and still had a week of the trip left (plus, I had to go to different cities after).So, I read online that throwing together some ingredients like honey, vinegar, lemon, hot water, etc would be an instant relief. I've never tried it but I was desperate. My hotel did not have the ingredients so I started walking along the block trying to find a place and I stumble upon Sam's diner. Katie was the one who welcomed me into the diner and although she was confused at my request at first (I mean, I would too if there was a girl who came in early in the morning trying to ask for random ingredients instead of a breakfast...heh), she ultimately came to my rescue as she let me make my sore throat relief there.Thanks to her and the diner for graciously letting me borrow some ingredients, I didn't get a cold and my sore throat was gone. I'd sincerely like to thank Katie and this diner, and next time I go to SF, I will definitely visit and get some food here!! I'll also have my SF friends go there on my behalf to support them as well :)Until then, I would recommend this place based on the customer service, as I'm super picky about customer service and which establishments to support because of the service level.

This place was right across the street from the hotel I was staying in and it was pleasant. The servers were friendly and really hustling to get the food out fast. I had an appetizer (chicken strips) and a dessert (blueberry cobbler) both were delicious. My mom had the fried chicken with the mash potatoes and veggies and she said it was delicious. We would go back.

This place is located walking distance from the hotel that I'm staying at. Went to the restaurant with a coworker and got seated by the waitress fairly quickly. The waiter that came by to take our order was friendly. I told the waiter it was my first time dining here and was looking to order the tacos, but was not sure which type of meat to choose - marinated beef, spicy pork, or fish. Per our waiter, he recommended the spicy pork tacos, which I went ahead and ordered. Food came out pretty fast. The tacos were delicious! Service was great and prices were decent. Definitely would come back here in the future.
