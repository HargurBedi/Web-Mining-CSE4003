Absolutely amazing! I had one their many scrumptious specials for the night. It was a goat cheese gnocchi with a lamb bolognese. The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth. The ambiance was soft and lit by candle and the wait staff was very attentive! The bread was fresh and the wine was good too. I was too full to taste their desserts but I bet they were good as well I was there when they opened at 5 and they were packed when I left an hour later. When I visit again I will be back.

It was good not great. Was greeted by a friendly hostess who served me a glass of Chianti while I waited for a table. No reservations accepted instead it is first come first served. Waits typically do not exceed 45 minutes. For a Thursday night there was a bit of a crowd that got bigger as the night went. On to the food. I started with a mixed salad which was pretty good. Followed with linguine with white clam sauce. This was a bit bland and the clams were diced and out of he shell. Portion size was big. Again not bad but not great either. Service and decor were good.

I live in the hood. I order delivery from here only when I'm too hungry to wait for delivery from some of the best Italian restaurants on the west coast down in North Beach. Nothing in this joint is excellent. The clam linguine is my go to and not too bad. Caprese is sad. Caesar is sadder. The restaurant is small, full of tourists and tough to be comfortable in. Also, most of the 4 and 5 stars that are given here on Yelp are from folks from out of town. No SF local would give them anymore than 3. If you want solid Italian, head down the street to Cappos, Tony's, Betty Lou's or Sotto Mare. And they take reservations.

Calzone was nothing but superb! Sauce on the side good fresh flavor, crust light and crispy not doughy at all. I would order this by the dozens! I added mushrooms and Italian Sausage. Too much for one person so taking half home for later.

Best neighborhood Italian place in the city but does get busy. There is no reservations so it's first come, first serve. I've been here like 7 times and the carbonara is the best. Even better than places in Italy as I went carbonara hunting in Rome. The lasagna is great and their basic spaghetti is great. They offer two kinds of bread too, the non-standard one is delicious. The place is small and does feel a little cramped but not unlike what it feels in Europe. Always a good meal and good value.

This is a really cute little gem nestled in a residential Nob Hill neighborhood. Came here with my friend my first week as an SF resident and it couldn't have been more of a signature San Fransiscan establishment.There was a bit of a wait but that's to be expected because the place is rather cramped inside. I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and tasted like little clouds of heaven! The sauce was also perfectly seasoned!I'd come back here to try the pizza which I hear is also KILLER.

Bf and I were visiting from Ventura, Ca and were craving Italian. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who, although had a few 2-seat reservations listed, told us if they don't come soon she'll seat us. She suggested we enjoy a beverage outside while we wait. This made me happy since there is nothing more annoying (whilehungry) when you see open tables available. The food was absolutely delectable. All in all-- great experience!

This place was busy on a Saturday night around 7:30 pm, so we ordered takeout. It's a 5 minute walk from the Fairmont and is just half a block from Grace Cathedral. The wait for a table looked about an hour long, but you can drink your wine outside while you wait.The open kitchen is near the door and the aroma flows out to the street. The food is excellent, but it would be best to phone ahead of time.

This is a place I've wanted to visit for awhile but never got around to it since I'm rarely ever in the area. But we did a few Sundays ago for brunch. We opted to be seated outside since it was pleasant out and it was probably best in the event our infant daughter decides to shriek, cry, wail, yell etc etc. They offer the traditional brunch fare including their usual pasta dishes. I opted for the latter and the hubs opted for the former. Food overall was nothing out of the ordinary however if you're hungry, it's certainly above "good enough" for me, at least. I kept wondering what the Italian family a couple tables down thought about Americanized Italian food they ordered and the bruschetta, which I might add I personally enjoyed. They must have thought it was just fine as they all seemed to have liked it and finished it. I'm glad to have checked off another establishment that I've had bookmarked for what seems like forever. The most exciting culinary adventures might not be had here however come without the expectation and you should be fine.

I don't get it.The staff isn't very friendly. You don't feel welcome at all.The service...meh...if you need something you can get them to bring it...but they don't seem like they want to be there, and they don't seem to like the customers...The food...I don't get it... I guess I have been trying a lot of really really wonderful places recently... I guess I'm more fortunate than most. I guess I'm just trying to find some reason why someone would like the food here...I'm trying to justify all of the 5 star reviews...but I really can't...Here's the thing... I want to feel like someone's grandma is working in the back, and I want to taste the handmade love. The reality is mine tasted 100% like it was from the frozen section from Costco. Maybe that is why the staff treats the customers with contempt, because they probability don't understand why people want to eat the awful food either.My advice. Go home. Light some candles. Turn off the lights. Microwave some Stouffer's and get yourself a glass of wine. You'd have a better time, have better food, and save some money. Unless your cat is a jerk; no one will treat you with contempt either.

This is a great neighborhood gem! I am new to SF and my daughter recommended I try this place. I've already been twice within two weeks! My first visit I had the pizza, which was delicious and more than enough for one person at a reasonable price. For my second visit, I had the carbonara, which was creamy and delicious! I almost hate to write this review, as it may become more crowded during the week than it already is (I visited around 1:00 both times and had a short wait). The staff is friendly--but very busy and can seem distracted...a small inconvenience for this new fave!

My boyfriend and I were in the area searching for a good place to relax and to eat after a long day when came across this gem. Although the place is small, but the food was delicious! We started with the carpaccio for appetizer then I ordered the spaghetti carbonara which was really good and flavorful (kinda oily on the bottom but overall a tasty entree). My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm which was okay (but I'm not a huge fan of chicken Parm in general). Our bill came out to be $60 (after tax and tip) but it's (good) Italian food so I'm not complaining. I had a great time. Service was good, food was good, place was cute, yeah I'd definitely come back when I'm in the area.

Nice, classic Italian offerings. Great bread basket, homemade gnocchi w/ bolognese, and chicken Parmesan. The chicken was baked instead of fried, which was initially disappointing, but it was seasoned and prepared very well. The cheesecake was pretty good, the cappuccino was very bitter. The place is warm and cozy, and was perfect for our first night in San Fran. The service was no-nonsense and professional, and I felt it was just a bit overpriced, but I also get that it's in Nob Hill.

This a quaint little place tucked around the corner from the fairmont. Either get there right when they open or be ready to wait a bit due to the lack of seating.I had the spaghetti alla carbonara. The dish was simple but oh so satisfying with the perfect balance of salty and creamy goodness. The pancetta wasn't over cooked and there was a good amount in the dish(both being issues I've had with similar dishes at other establishments). If I had any criticism for the dish it would be to add some mushrooms and or some peas for visual contrast.My girlfriend had one of the specials, rigatoni with andoullie sausage, snap peas, and a cream sauce. Sadly it fell short. The dish pretty much just tasted like smokey pasta. In hindsight we should've known better than to go with a non-Italian sausage at an Italian restaurant lol.The staff was friendly and fast while not making us feel rushed. We were the last ones in at the end of that opening rush and we're out of there in 45mins while taking our time.I would definitely go back to this place.

Came here on a double date with my boyfriend and his classmates. We really wanted to try the tiki lounge but didn't realize it was reservation only (womp womp womp) and found this little gem since we were in the area. The wait was so long but it was a saturday night and we found good parking and were too hungry to drive around and wait else where. I was a little apprehensive about sticking around because italian food is italian food..... which I was eventually proven wrong. I got the Linguine Alla Vongole and Vong-holy moly. Clams baby. Clams everywhere. Every single spoon full. I was REALLY pleasantly surprised to find that I was not jipped. On another note, the lemon really complimented the clams and made it easier to consume as I'm not one for the creaminess of pastas (i know, shame on me). The portion was HUGE and I was unable to finish. My bf was happy I didn't though cos more for himBf got the tortellini romana, it was good but mine was better :POur friend got the pork chop special (I don't know if it was on the menu but it was written on the chalkboard). That was pretty good! He licked the plate clean.Lastly we got the gnocchi bolognese which was really good! I love gnocchi...I'm really happy that tiki lounge was packed because we got to try maybe the best italian places EVER! Oh and the waitress was very nice and helpful to choosing out dishes. Thank you!

I wanted a cute Italian place and while this place appeared to have met all of my qualifications- my experience kind of sucked. First off, our waitress had an attitude from the get-go. She refused to sit us until our whole party got there, but we were unsure if they were even going to come and I was starving. She reluctantly sat us at a table of 5 (3 of us were there) and just had an unpleasant demeanor the entire time. Our 2 people didn't end up showing up and she just couldn't help herself but to say "this is why we don't seat people until the whole party is here." OKAY, WE GOT IT. It was just unnecessary. I was a server for many years and while I understand where she is coming from, it was not a big deal. It wasn't busy. Large parties were not beating down the door to come in. And while I do understand the reason, she did not need to reiterate it as we were about to leave. Food: the garlic bread was anti climactic but my linguine was pretty darn good.

First off, not only am I completely in love with carbonara since my first encounter in Italy, but I'm super picky as to what I consider carbonara to be "good." The carbonara at Nob Hill Cafe was so freaking delicious. I floored when I took my first bite! -- imagine that scene in "eat, pray, love." I've been to so many different restaurants and have tried so many takes on their version of "carbonara" but nothing could ever compare to my first experience in Italy. It was like love at first bite again at this place! So basically, I HIGHLY recommend the Carbonara. Not overly creamy, not too salty, not too fatty considering there's a generous amount of pancetta haha, and the spaghetti was al dente. Definitely going to be dreaming about this place!

The food all around is delicious! My personal favorite is the lasagna! Not saying I know much about Italian cuisine, but this is THE BEST lasagna I have ever had. Every time I order something else, I definitely enjoy it. BUT I always wish that I ordered the lasagna. Therefore, lasagna is my go-to item at Nob hill Cafe. Their house wines are also pretty good bang for their buck. My personal choice is the house cabernet.They really shine with their service! Special mention has to go to the servers MacKenzie and Robin (apologies if I misspelled the names), who are super nice people. Whenever I eat here, I go out of my way to make sure I sit in their section. Still, everyone else is wonderful, from the kitchen, to the host and other wait staff. It's just that I truly look forward to seeing MacKenzie and Robin when I visit Nob Hill Cafe. I would highly recommend dining here whenever one is in the area.

Takeaway: Don't go for the French Toast but try the omelettes!Nob Hill Cafe was open on New Years' Day and hit the spot after a night out. We waited about 20 minutes because we had a party of five. It's a small place. We were seated next to the door (which was great because we got some sun), but our fifth person sat next to the door and was constantly having to close the door when people walked in. Food: We ordered from the brunch menu. I ordered the French Toast (with a side of potatoes and a cup of coffee. I also tried some of their prawn and avocado omelette (comes with a side of potatoes and cornbread). The French Toast was mediocre at best. There was no powdered sugar and it did not live up to my expectations. The omelette tasted great and I wish I ordered that. The potatoes tasted slightly bland. I really enjoyed the coffee. If I come again, I would go for an omelette (many choices) or try something on the lunch menu. Service: Service was the best thing about this place. Most places aren't open for brunch on New Years' Day so this was in a great location (we celebrated and stayed near Union Square). The wait was significantly shorter than we expected. The waitress was amazing. She greeted us warmly at the door and invited us in. She got us excited about the food and checked up on us without feeling overbearing. She made the experience.Other Notes:1. None of us ordered the lunch dishes, but the aroma of Italian food made us really hungry.2. Our party of five was a bit big. Four people max.

My friends and I were excited about going to this quant, family-owned and well-rated Italian restaurant before going to a performance at Grace Cathedral just up the street. We were surprised however that the service we received was incredibly disappointing. It felt very snobby and also potentially homophobic. Let me explain: I am a gay man and did have fingernail polish on and lightened hair, as well as carrying a paper bag from Kinkos and a blanket (which we needed for the performance). When I went up to the hostess (who was the rudest person) she immediately seemed cold and made me feel unwelcome like I didn't belong there. They were also quite curt about not allowing us to be seated until our full party arrived (one of our party of three was running late and we had to eat in time for the performance), despite there being plenty of open tables and us observing them making exceptions for others. After waiting awhile and enduring unwelcoming looks, my friend and I were finally seated, and when our third party showed up 15 mins later she had to sit at another table behind us (again despite open seats) which created a downright silly situation. The food was fairly good and our server was more pleasant than the other two ladies that spoke with us, but overall it was still notably unwelcoming and we won't be back. For some perspective, we are all in our thirties with graduate degrees from elite schools and regularly eat at nice restaurants without ever feeling such judgement, and this is the first time I've ever written a negative Yelp review. I hope something good will come from it and others won't face such rudeness, even if they look gay and/or somewhat unusual.

We showed up at 5:40 pm on a Friday to beat the crowd and get to a show at the Masonic. I had found this restaurant via Yelp, and I was excited: a little Italian restaurant with homemade pasta that's around the corner from the venue! Crazy! Alas, yes, it's a little restaurant, but everything else in my experience just did not square with the positive reviews.We were seated by the only path to the bathroom/kitchen. I realized that we'd have constant foot traffic over us as staff moved back and forth from the kitchen, so my husband asked that we be moved. This was met with some attitude, as if we should have known not to be seated there from the beginning. Come on! You stuffed the tables in that corner out of pure greed in the first place. Nobody wants to sit there; everyone is enduring those two tables. Since I am about to spend a bunch of cash at your restaurant, perhaps I should have a small chance to actually enjoy being there?We weren't given the focaccia bread everyone describes. We were given cold stale white bread. The caprese salad clearly had store-bought mozzarella and rather terrible tomatoes as the base. To hide the presentation, wilted greens were thrown over the top, and the whole thing was soaked in balsamic vinegar. Unpitted olives dotted the plate, as well as red onion. What's Italian about this? I also had the salad with roasted eggplant, and it was mainly comprised of wilted greens soaked in balsamic. I had more balsamic in my antipasti at this restaurant than I consume over the course of a full year. My gnocchi was the worst gnocchi I think I have ever had. Some pieces were just straight up lumps of potato, and a couple were just weird runny messes with lumps of potato inside. The bolognese sauce tasted like some beef was thrown into some tomato sauce at the last minute. There was no richness to the sauce. My husband's lasagna was terrible as well: the thing looked like a collapsed haphazard combination of ingredients that were never actually combined properly or cooked long enough.Tiramisu is my favorite dessert. By the time we were offered the dessert menu, based on the gnocchi and the lasagna, I didn't want to find out what a screwed-up tiramisu tastes like.This dinner was a waste of my money and time.

Food and waiter service was average and definitely not worth the wait. We had the lasagne, calzone, and pasta with the Romano cream sauce. Unfortunately the host who we checked in was rather curt and not helpful. When we put our names he told us an hour, maybe a little less. We had little ones with us, so we left for a bit to a playground right around the corner. We came back though within 30 min to make sure we were well within the time he had given us. He said he called our names 5 min earlier and that we would have to wait again. We ended up waiting closer to an hour and a half. When I asked to at least look at a menu I had to ask more than once. He seemed more interested in helping everyone else. When I complained he told me seating is not an exact science. I do understand that but there's a big difference between 25 min and 1 hour. He was nicer towards the end. We would have eaten somewhere else except the friends we met had a toddler/did not drive and there were not many other restaurants within walking distance.

I do recommend how ever going here on a weekday early evening , unless you want to be lining up MY the door for a 20-35 min wait.

We went to this Restuarant two times in our one weekend in SF. Robyn was the sweetest waitress and we got amazing food. Try the pistachio gelato dessert (trust me.) It was affordable, sweet and the atmosphere led to easy and fun conversation. Recommend.

Be prepared to wait. Food was good but not anything spectacular. We were crammed into a small corner with my daughter in danger of being hit by the front door anytime anyone entered the restaurant. We had pizza, lasagne, tortellini with white sauce(best option) and spicy penne pasta.Server and hostess were very nice. IMO if you want to eat here I would get food to go.

we figured a 45 minute wait meant that the food would be awesome - wrong. We were admittedly one of the lasy groups seated but when you arrive at 8 and wait until 845 you dont expect the staff to start breaking down at 950 - especially when there is still a line. What really got us was the chicken parm which was just chicken breast topped with a little sauce and some cheese. Quite disapointing.

This place is ok, food not really worth the wait, but it's a really cute dining experience. This place is always packed! After two years of living in the neighborhood, I've only eaten here twice, while I've tried to eat here at least 5 times and found the wait too long. It has an old world charm all around - being close to the Grace Cathedral and Huntington park. Sitting at the window looking outside will make you feel like you're in Europe. Of the two times we visited, we ordered:- calamari and beans salad: Salad was standard, but too acidic. - margherita pizza: standard, not impressive- penne bettola: spicy tomato cream sauce. also just standard, wasn't bad, wasn't great. - Trancia di Calamari - calamari steak. it was a bit too breaded. Standard European way of cooking it with capers and white wine. The pasta that came with it was quite bad, though. Overall, I think the food is fine, nothing special. It feels like the American taste of Europe in the 80s, where people liked the creamy sauces and buttery dishes. I think this place is going to stay popular and I'm happy to see that happen. But as the city has higher and higher standard for food, they might have to start upgrading their food to satisfy people's changing palate.

This place is really delicious Italian food for a great price! The staff is very nice and hard working! The place is small and fills up very quickly. It's one of our favorite spots to eat as it is a few blocks from our apartment. Highly recommend it! My husband orders the chicken parm all the time. He loves it. I get a pizza it's delicious crust has good crunch.

The food was delicious and the ambiance was very nice. My only complaints was the extremely long wait (which I knew about ahead of time) and the service was only ok. I came alone on a Thursday night and it was packed. There was a 25 minute wait and the only place wait is outside. The hostess was doing her best to accommodate everyone and there were some pretty finicky people waiting. When I sat down it took about another 10 minutes for my waitress to come over and ask for my drink order, I had the menu this entire time so I already knew what I wanted, I decided to skip the drink and just order because I wasn't sure when she was going to come back. To be fair I think there was only 2 servers in the whole restaurant, one on each side, probably 6 to 8 tables each. I wasn't upset or anything, I wasn't in any rush (which you probably shouldn't be if you come here). I ordered the chicken fettuccine with pesto sauce and pine nuts. Before the entree comes out they serve bread which was absolutely delicious. The main course was to die for. I would definitely recommend it. Overall, Food: 5 stars Service: 3 stars Cost: 4 stars. I would definitely come here again if I was in the bay area again.

Another trip to San Francisco just to try different types of food. It's different to compare LA food with SF food. I'm a big fan of pasta and I saw this on Yelp and it was close to the hotel I was staying at, so I decided to give it a try. The restaurant is smaller than I expected, but this place was actually really cute and quiet. I got here at 6:30 and there wasn't a wait at all. We were seated to a small table for two. It was pretty dim inside, but they had a lil candle on the table for a bit of light. It's a bit fancy. They give you some bread with butter while you wait for your meal. I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but one of them tasted it. It seems like a muffin like bread. I ordered a Spaghetti Alla Carbonara. It was really delicious. It cost $12.75, but then I think it was worth it. It was really good. The pasta wasn't hard which I prefer soft speghetti and the sauce was good with the little bits of bacon I believe or some kind of meat. My boyfriend got Trancia Di Calamari. It's a calamari steak and it cost $17.95, which we think wasn't reallt worth it. He didn't really like the steak because the sauce they had for it was really sour which made it taste a bit weird. Other than the sauce being sour, the calamari wasn't that bad. It also came with some pasta and pea. When they serve you the meal. they ask if you want cheese or pepper. The service here is really great. They would come around giving us water and asking if everything is okay. The server was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back here when I come visit San Francisco.

Rude staff. I live in the Bay Area, and my sister, brother in law, and niece were in town visiting. We thought the food looked good, so we thought we would try it out. However, we never even sat down because the woman who showed us our table was so rude we left.

I stopped here with my boyfriend for brunch before heading back to our hometown. I really liked how interesting their menu was and mimosas are always a plus. The food itself was pretty good, I enjoyed the fact that they took some usually heavier meals and turned them into something lighter. I had a salmon scramble, my boyfriend had the chicken omelette (or scramble, I can't remember) and we shared french toast. The wait staff was nice, however one really stood out and was super nice and accommodating. My boyfriend asked if they had any hot sauce besides Tapatio and she kindly said no but returned with a specially made hot sauce from the kitchen. Would definitely come back to this place!

Nob Hill sophistication with an excellent flare for one of SF'a best food. I had the Lasagne al Forno as a main course started with the Crostini di Polenta and a very refreshing Insalata Mista. Any chance I get I make a point to dine here.Checked it off the SF bucket list.

Went there for lunch, and was amazed at the level of service (only had one hour lunch, and the two dishes came to our table within 10 minutes of our order!). Despite small, it was cozy and with the rain outside it looked like we were in Europe. Gnocchi with pesto sauce: deliciously smooth and comes apart in your mouth! Linguini agli olio was also delicious, perfectly al dente.

Thanks to the woman who left the crappy review of this unpretentious little cafe we knew how to approach our dinner out with friends without reservations. Our friends put our names on the list while we found parking. They took a table outside and had beverages until we joined them. Our party was seated within 10 minutes. This was a wonderful spot for us to meet. The service was attentive and sweet. The food was excellent, the prices extremely reasonable and the portions, happily were generous. I chose this spot after realizing that it was our best alternative for dinner before seeing Jeff Beck athe the Masonic. I hadn't been there in 20 years but it was as good it was back in the 90s. Only bigger!Go. Know how to get on the list and enjoy yourselves.

What a wonderful neighborhood gem. Delicious Italian food. Salads are gourmet and large enough to share. Pizza and pasta are both great.

Really disappointed that this place fell so short of expectations. Sure, it's cute and the staff is friendly enough that our carry-out experience was pleasant but the salad was a study in wither and salt; sad and greasy enough that we gave up after a fork's worth each. The pizza was okay, a forgettable but basically decent margherita. In hindsight, I wouldn't have hiked the few blocks up Taylor to dine here when other well-reviewed options were closer.
