Absolutely love this place! Pisco Sour and Inca Kola are two drinking musts, though only the first one has alcohol.Appetizer: Ceviche.Entre: Lomo Saltado!! Ask for extra aji if you like it spicy.Happy Hour is a great time to come after work for smaller plates.**Call ahead to make reservations for large parties.

So a vegetarian goes to a seafood restaurant...and has a fabulous experience!! :)This restaurant is beautiful both inside and outdoors. We were in SF on the most perfect day for dinner (no wind, & no fog!) so we decided to sit outside. We were a party of 8 both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Food: 1. Veggie Cebiche: I know what you're thinking...Is veggie cebiche even a thing? Yes, yes it is! Must try2. Causa Vegetarian: potatoes with salad. Really unique. loved it! Must order3. Quinoa Chaufa: We got one with egg and one without. I preferred the one without egg as it was much more flavorful. My favorite dish4. Empanadas: We got 2 corn and 2 mushrooms. I'm not a fan of corn so didn't try those. The mushroom was very delicious. My 2nd favorite dish5. Plancha Veggie: Salad and sauce are very unique and taste great. I wish I had pictures for all these dishes but definitely next time. I did not expect to have such a great vegetarian experience eating Peruvian food. All their ingredients are carefully chosen to create flavorful, unique dishes. I would recommend all vegetarians to at least try this place once! We ordered drinks, almost all the vegetarian options on the menu along, and seafood for the non-veggies. We ended up paying ~$80 per person. It is pricey but worth the experience overlooking the bay bridge

OMG...best paella like dish I have ever had - Arroz Norteno was to die for. Most restaurants overlook their shrimp leaving them dry and rubbery. We foodies know that they weren't meant to be eaten like that. The shrimp combined with the perfectly cooked rice and seasoned with the most perfect savory blend. The shrimp were joined by succulent scallops and prawns. I will be back for that Fish even if I have to fly to San Francisco for dinner. We also sampled the Lomo Saltado - a traditional Peruvian dish including perfectly grilled thin sliced filet with onions, fries and bell peppers. It was delectable as well. Our meal started with plantains and a spicy cilantro crema. Since we didn't have reservations we sat in the bar, my preference anyways. Our waitress recommended a lovely Sauvignon Blanc to accompany my meal. Love this place.

La Mar was spot-on in every aspect. Beautiful decor and views of the Bay. Flawless service. But most of all the food was incredible. We had the cebiche tasting (3 types), chicken empanadas, and the nikei causa (a dish of whipped potatoes topped with raw tuna and rocoto cream ). With all these different dishes, I'm unable to really pick a favorite. All the raw seafood was really fresh, the empanadas were flaky and savory, and every sauce had bright, bold flavors. The meal was complemented by pisco sours that really balanced the acidity of the ceviches. I also could have eaten the entire cone of plantain chips all by myself. I wanted to return to La Mar again the moment I left, so 5 stars is well-deserved.

Had dinner here with a colleague on a Tuesday evening. The service was fantastic and the food was even better. We shared the ceviche sampler, and then we both ordered the salmon. I was not disappointed at all. Further, we each enjoyed a nice glass of white wine. I regret that I do not remember what type of wine it was, but it was wonderful. Truly an enjoyable evening. Great ambience.

Amazing food and amazing views! La Mar sits right out on San Francisco Bay at the Embarcadero, and on a nice day, the atmosphere is simply perfect, and the dishes are delicious and creative. I came for a business lunch and though the food was pricey, I was impressed by the quality and execution of everything we tasted.After we ordered, the servers brought to the table a small canister of warm plantain and potato chips with the most delicious spicy dipping sauce! For our appetizers, we shared the clasico cebiche with the catch of the day (halibut), marinated in leche de tigre and paired with red onions, Peruvian corn, and sweet potato. This ceviche wasn't particularly strong in flavor but was refreshing and nicely tart. The nikei tiradito (Japanese sashimi Peruvian style) was made of thin slices of ahi tuna, along with an Asian-inspired passion fruit and honey marinade, sesame seeds, and bean sprouts--this was definitely one of the most delicious things we got! Finally, we had the quinoa salad with burrata, a simple mixture of greens, tomatoes, and quinoa. The salad was dressed in balsamic vinegar and had a great mixture of sweet and tart flavors.We had to wait an eternity for the main dishes to come, but I loved the hefty, savory flavors of the lomo saltado--a tender, stir-fried beef tenderloin with tomatoes, peppers, cilantro, potatoes, and rice on the side. It was seasoned with more Asian-inspired ingredients like soy and oyster sauces, which added a great umaminess to the dish. We also had the salmon la mar, a simply-prepared salmon that was still rare in the middle, served over a black lentil cake with a spicy red sauce drizzled all over. The salmon seemed almost a little bit too rare to me, but everything about the dish was delicious!And finally, dessert--the choco-maracuya was a passion fruit mousse layered on chocolate mousse with almond praline on the bottom--the fruity passion fruit paired so nicely with the rich chocolate. The tres leche cake was perfectly soaked through and moist with the milk mixture and was served with fresh strawberries on the side! Though pricey, La Mar's beautiful, quality dishes make this restaurant worth the visit! Just make sure you're not in a rush and simply enjoy the serene atmosphere of the restaurant!

Amazing food, exceptional service, great location and right on water, I can't think of a reason for not giving this place 5 stars! We didn't want a heavy dinner so ordered the ceviche tasting, grilled veggies and shrimp croquets, it was perfect amount of food and I loved every single dish - fresh and seasoned well. The ceviche was close to what I had in Peru, which I ranked the best ceviche I've tasted. I saw some very good deserts came out too but didn't have room for it. Definitely going back for a full dinner. Overall a great dining experience.

Had an exceptional dining experience here this past Saturday for dinner. The restaurant is located on the pier, and has a beautiful view of the water whether you're sitting outside or inside (although recommend sitting outside if you can!).Service was absolutely phenomenal. One of those rare instances where you are so genuinely pleased with service and have literally zero complaints. Food was really really good. It's best eaten family style - order a variety of items to share with the table. We came here after a huge lunch that day, so weren't able to try nearly as much of the menu as we would have liked to. Recommend coming here with a group of at least 4 or so, so that you can taste a bunch of different items and flavors!We shared some ceviche dishes and skewers. All of the food was full of so much flavor, with a great spicy kick. Also loved the fried plantains and potato chips that were served at the beginning, along with a spicy aioli dipping sauce. So delicious.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in SF hands down. The food is simply excellent! You've got to order the ceviche sampler (3 types) and the empanadas (you get one of each: chicken, beef, mushroom, and a surprisingly delicious corn empanada). You can't go wrong, I haven't had anything that wasn't great, although the sea urchin was very small for being $30+.TIP: eat outside! There's a beautiful view of the Bay, and there are overhead heaters for cooler nights. The patio is shaded. This restaurant is best enjoyed family/tapas style. I highly recommend this restaurant and cannot wait to go back!

So this review is just for their happy hour, which is amazing! The happy hour is just in the bar and once I finally beat out the other yuppies, was able to snag seats at the communal table. After three rounds of cocktails at only $7 each, I can safely say that I looooved the Volcan and Pisco Sour. The Volcan had a great kick to it. Service was fast and very friendly as well. If you're working nearby, this is a great happy hour spot!

They sat a party of 6 fairly quickly and the restaurant was open and airy. It had a historic beach vibe.Original server was Gina and she was really friendly. Then a male server came and took over and was really pushy. They bring complementary plaintain chips that are delicious and crunchy.The lomo saltado was one of the best we have had.The guy had repeated back our order after we ordered and still managed to screw up and not put in order for mom's ceviche. After everything was brought for us and hers wasn't we finally caught his attention. He did acknowledge he screwed up and forgot to place order for hers and within 10 minutes had hers ready.Dad spoke to waitress before we left since she came to wish us a good day - we expressed we hope her table - us - hadn't been hijacked and she said it was but she was given another table. Minus a star - though the guy who thought he had upsold us and gotten a high roller table must have been disappointed when we didn't take him up on any of his recommendations. No we would not like a $78 full octopus and cocktails at 12pm when it is very hot outside and we have big dinner plans. He never introduced himself with a name so can't say who he was.

I went to Peru last year and I didn't have anything this good. Then again I didn't ever spend this much...Came here for an afternoon brunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was not very full, we were able to get a seat overlooking the water. Even though we were technically sitting outside, you can hardly tell.We ordered the ceviche and skewers platters. Took our waiter's recommendation and added the octopus to the skewer platter. Glad we did cause it was my favorite one! The ceviche was amazing; each one had a very different flavor. Went really well with the plantain chips they give. Also ordered a Pisco Sour, which is like the go-to drink for Peruvians. Even though the drink was smaller than I expected, it was pretty strong! Overall, great service and even better food. Definitely would recommend it, especially if you are looking for some authentic Peruvian food!

One of my favorite restaurants in SF! I love Peruvian food!The ceviche clasico is a must! Empanadas samplers or grilled octopus are other options to share. For main, I've had the Arroz La Mar, which is arborio rice with shrimp, clams, and calamari. Another favorite is Pasta Criollo, which is squid ink pasta with shrimp and calamari. But my all-time favorite is the grilled catch of the day, one time they had paiche, which is a white fish from the Amazon, it was amazing!There's indoor and outdoor patio seating right on the waterfront so get a table outdoors on a nice day. Service is friendly and prompt. Restaurant is located in the Embarcadero so take a walk around before or after dinner.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but whatever I had in mind was not the extraordinary experience I discovered.We arrived about 8 pm on a Thursday without a reservation. Upon seeing that the place was packed, I was concerned we wouldn't get a table. The hostess was able to accommodate us at a table near the open kitchen. I love being able to watch all the activities in the kitchen, plus it makes me feel that the kitchen is really clean.The restaurant is open, with lots of large windows, and very chicly designed. And that place was abuzz with activity.Neither my Venezuelan boyfriend nor I have eaten Peruvian food. But we were game to try. We had a great server who took the time to explain traditional Peruvian cooking and La Mer's twist on them.We decided to share an appetizer. Good choice because it was generously sized as were the entrees. We had purple potatoes with crab and caviar. So good. As entrees, he had salmon, which looked divine. I opted for a traditional beef entree with the most fantastic sauce I've ever eaten. We shared dessert - passion fruit and chocolate mouse. And you MUST try the Pisco, which is a traditional Peruvian liquor. But of course, La Mer creates their own cool, craft cocktails.The only sad part of this experience is that I don't know when I'll be back in SF to enjoy this restaurant again.

My fav restaurant in the city! Love the food! Love the wine and the ambiance!! Sit on the outdoor back patio during Spring or Summer overlooking the water is ideal. There are heaters and see-through cover-ups to block from the cold wind during the Fall and Winter. Ceviche is here BOMB! I recommend to all of the ceviche dishes! Love the plantain chips and their dips! Ask them for the super spicy hot dip as well.You would never think it...and might not ever get to it; bc of being too full at eating the appetizers and enters; BUT!!!...the desert here is freaking delicious! Gotta try the chocolate mousse with quinoa...OMG!!! Pretty much, try to come here with a large party to order everything on the menu. I mean it...try everything. So good!!! Oh! There's HH at the cool bar area from 3-6pm. Can't wait come back!!!!!!!!

The pisco sour was on the strong side for us. We tried the summer splash which was refreshing. Given our drinks were strong, we definitely were not able to enjoy our meal to the fullest. We ordered the Cebiche Tasting, which provided an excellent selection and variety. The tuna cebiche was much more subtle compared to the other two. We absolutely enjoyed the orange sauce that went with it. We also got the arroz la mar. We thought the bell peppers were an excellent texture, and the seafood all tasted so fresh. The shrimp was definitely a highlight as it was cooked to perfection.

I wish they would let you choose 3 of what you want (especially since the nikei was not very spectacular).-beef empanadas: 2 per order, pretty pricey for the tiny portions. -lomo saltado: pretty salty, but delicious. I wish there was more meat for the whole dish.-arroz la mar: yummy! packed with seafood.

I've been here years back for the happy hour & shared plates of ceviche & empanadas, but today I decided to do lunch & we were able to sit in the outside back area. Heaters on, enclosed, but still had the views of the bay.We did an appetizer special which was a little bit of everything and were told they were small bites but no that platter was HUGE! We really enjoyed the seared Ahi & Salmon nigiri most of all! I had the crab & pasta special, pricey because it was market priced but it was delicious, fresh, & light.My boyfriend had the tuna burger, it was ground tuna, seared throughout. The plantain chips & dip on the house are really good to.The dishes are pricey, but if you just come here & for the sampler of the ceviche & empanadas you won't be disappointed.

Founding chef Gaston Acurio's cuisine is very good. We shared an entire octopus entree between 3 people, enough to satisfy us deliciously. The server quoted it at $69 when providing the specials, but final bill showed $79. My biggest critic is for the front bar. The bar staff didn't allow me to order a drink before happy hour ended for a friend who was on her way. Their policy is not to serve more than one drink per person. I find this highly limiting and a turn off to customers. The bar wasn't very busy on Monday evening, what did it hurt to add more drinks to the tab? It is HELPING YOUR BUSINESS. Generally, the food is good but this restaurant is overpriced with unnecessary limitations.

BECAUSE it's so unique, I also recommend being ready to spend some money and sharing a bunch of items with the table to get the most of the experience!

As a fellow Peruvian, La Mar is a restaurant that everyone in Lima knows about. La Mar was opened by renown chef Gaston Acurio, yes the restapreneur that revolutionize Peruvian cuisine.La Mar offers Gaston's favorite plates:- Ceviche: raw fish, lemon, chili, salt. You can try it Nikkei style (Japanese-Peruvian)- Tiradito- Lomo Saltado- Fried rice Peruvian style- Arroz con mariscos- Empanadas (corn, beef, chicken, etc).- Drinks - pisco, chilcanos, maracuya sour, etc.- Anticuchos (beef heart)We love the chefs in house - Piero, Victoriano, and Danny! Lovely service. Of course, this is an expensive restaurant so every time you pay, your wallet cries.

San Francisco is one of the best cities to dine in. With so many amazing restaurants throughout the city, my fiance chose La Mar to celebrate our 1 year anniversary of the day we met. I'm extremely happy he chose this restaurant as it was an amazing experience from the second we entered, to the very last sip of our champagne!Out server, Mateo, went above and beyond to ensure that we had an excellent experience. He was super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and extremely attentive. We were super appreciative of him for taking the extra mile of taking amazing pictures of us outside of the restaurant (near the water, since we sat outside) and bringing us champagne on the house to celebrate our special day! Mateo, thank you so much such a great experience! Let's talk about the food. This place is awesome if you love seafood. If you don't, they have plenty of veggie and meat options, as well. Their tuna with avocado as an appetizer was to die for. The sauce... I'm still drooling over it! For our mains, we had the halibut and the sizzling dish with assorted seafood. The cocktails were excellent, as well. I loved the mezcal one. Do yourself a favor and sit in the outside area. Enjoy the fresh air and the beautiful view. This restaurant is pricey, but worth it! Tip: Ask for their house hot sauce and their house aioli. Mix those two together and thank me later ;)

Great place to meet friends and family for good food and cocktails. It's at Pier 1 1/2 In San Francisco, right by the Ferry Building. We parked at a lot right across the street for $25. The food was delicious but pricier than average Peruvian restaurants but the ambience is great, it's right on the water and you can tell they try to do more with each dish. The beef in the lomo saltado was very tender, ceviche was fresh, Dungeness crab over purple potatoes was delightful, prawns over rice made for a pretty tasty paella. We ordered 2 desserts and they were just ok. But the cocktails made up for it. The prickly pear margarita was the favorite at our table. Reservations are highly recommended and outside seating is ideal. We're already planning to come back on our next get together!

Last night of our holiday - what a way to finish!Came here off the back of a recommendation from a taxi driver of all people and we were so glad we did. My friend and I had never tried Peruvian food until this visit and were a little unsure of what to expect... however, hugely delighted in the flavour sensations. Every mouthful we experienced a different flavour and texture. MAINSMy friend had the Salmon la mar and I requested the Quinoa chaufa with seafood, but kindly asked the waiter if this could be done without squid or clams, which wasn't a problem. Both mains were absolutely incredible and by far one of the best meals i have personally ever experienced. DESSERTSMy friend had the passion fruit and chocolate mousse and I had the chocolate version. We left feeling extremely satisfied and delighted with our first ever experience of such amazing food. Mid range price wise but well worth it and great portion sizes. Highly recommend. Thanks again.

I would say this place is more like a 4.5 stars. I have now been here twice and I have not had a single dish I didn't think was amazing. My favorite of the chiviches is the mixto. The empanadas are also great. We also tried the veggie quinoa and it was surprisingly SO yummy. I would recommend coming with a small group and ordering a bunch of things to share. The cocktails are also all delicious and I love that they carry Peruvian beer! The only thing keeping this restaurant from a 5 star for me is the service is on the slow side and the prices are a little steep as well. Well worth it but maybe save it for special occasions.

My favorite Peruvian restaurant in the city, bar none!Food: From the juicy and citric cebiche to the flaky and warm empanadas, you'll find a range of appetizers to start your dining experience at La Mar. Our more recent outing involved trying the fritter sampler which included a selection of fried apps: empanadas, croquettes and yuquitas. They ranged in flavor, oily-ness and texture, but all were grounded in authenticity and deliciousness! I tend to be traditional when it comes to my main entree and order Arroz la Mar as my entree 99.9% of the time. I love how the bed of rice is always crunchy and evenly, yet lightly fried and how the selection of veggies seems to change each time. It's topped with the freshest seafood medley and I like to believe they stand out on the nearby pier and fish it out and then place it straight onto my plate. If you like seafood, I recommend this dish! My friend is similar in routine and goes for the Lomo Saltado and each time he reacts as if he'd never tried it before. The dish stand out compared to others we've had due to the perfect balance of flavors, adding an even amount of soy and oyster sauce and countering that saltiness with garlic and tomatoes which both cut through the sodium. They tend to cook the meat slightly different so that all of the juices from the meat are preserved, allowing the juices to soak into the potatoes and rice! Cocktails are fairly average, yet fresh and pair well wish dishes!Service: Always personable, hospitable and friendly staff.Price: Be ready to pay a pretty penny or two! I love that they maintain their prices, because I truly believe Latin food is stereotyped as needing to be cheap, but La Mar's high quality, authentic and consistently delicious dishes truly deserve their price point. Ambiance: Spacious, sophisticated, yet comforting atmosphere. I recommend asking them to seat you on the patio so that you can enjoy the waterfront!Overall: If my wallet allowed, I'd be here every weekend. Authentic, clean, fresh and flavorful dishes, personable staff and a lively environment. I'd recommend this place to locals and visitors!

Classic Ceviche- awesome. That fish was jello soft and it was damn good.We got two anticucho's which were also quite good- Corazon and Pulpo. Pulpo was my favorite- octopus cooked to perfection. I'm definitely coming back for that!Seco de Carillera - Not worth it at all. Wtf $50 for simple beef stew. Sorry but this dish was so extremely disappointing. I could not taste aji amarillo anywhere in that dish.We asked for a side of aji roccoto and HOLY CAMOLY that was SPICY. In general, I'm a huge fan of spicy anything. Like, spicy cocktails? I'm there. And please make it extra spicy. But oooh wheeeee that aji roccoto was death, lol. I'd totally buy it if they sold it in a jar but I tell ya, it's not to play with. My appetite completely went flat after trying out the hot sauce- I didn't know that was possible? Still, I loved it. It was delicious. Hah!

This place is good to go to when you're on a diet cause the food is fresh, many healthy options, and it's really hard to overeat without paying a lot. The ceviches and tiraditos here are excellent. The octopus antichucho is super tender yet flavorful because of the smoky paprika based sauce. Really can't go wrong with most of the food and drinks menu although I haven't tried everything yet. I'd come here more often if it weren't so pricey. However, given how busy this place is (30 minute wait on a Monday night), it doesn't seem to be a deterrent for most San Franciscans. Service is average - we had to ask for water a couple of times.

Location and ambiance trump a lot understandably, but I was underwhelmed with the cuisine as well as service at La Mar. I came here for a friend's birthday, and we had such a large party that it was recommended we reserve a "private room" for everyone. Just so we're clear, the "room" was not "private," but rather a sectioned off area that was extremely loud and cramped so that our party of twenty people barely had room to turn around in our seats. Additionally, this prior booking required a fixed menu so that the kitchen could (again understandably) prepare for such a large party. But instead of portions for each guest, single-portion dishes were served with the idea that 3-4 people would be sharing. I don't see how this decision was practical or even conceivably understandable. It's San Francisco -- I get it, but the steep amount for a private room, service fees, and then minuscule portions all added up to a woefully disappointing experience. I have to give an honorable mention (the negative kind) to the hostess at the front, who could not have been more dismissive and nonchalant when our group walked in and asked about our reservation. She responded with an "Oh" and general wave of her hand for us to walk towards the back before looking straight through us to the next guest. Our servers were warmer and more helpful, although they did mess up the drink orders quite a few times. The busboys, though, were impressively prompt and tactful about swiping away empty glasses and refilling water cups. It was such a small space that I was mystified at how they managed to efficiently clear away plates and neatly place new ones.The food was unmemorable as far as I remember, and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to snap any pictures. I do remember that the empanadas were mediocre, and I thought that the dough was overly thick and the filling dry. The ceviche was also just okay and I could have used a lot more acidity, although I liked the huge kernels of Peruvian corn mixed in. The sauteed beef with vegetables was overly salty and though the beef was fresh, it was noticeably overcooked and stringy. I think the strangest dishes of the night were definitely the Korean-esque bowls of mixed ingredients cooked in hot stone pots. I suppose the goal was to simulate a bibimbap kind of dish, but the tastes were rather bizarre and dissonant. There was a vegetarian version and a meat version, and both were unpalatable. I think I may almost prefer the vegetarian version with its quinoa and arugula mixture, but that in itself just sounds unappetizing. I'm not sure if these options are on the regular menu, but I wouldn't recommend them. The other honorable mention (this time a positive one) goes to the desserts. The different kinds of sorbets were refreshing and had a good mixture of tart and sweet, although I really wished that our servers could have let us know a description of the flavors upon serving. There was also a rich chocolate mousse that was a tad sweet for my taste, but the texture was airy and pleasingly light. My favorite was the strawberries and cream dessert with a freshly-made tuile on top. This was the perfect balance of freshness and creaminess for me, and the tuile was fragrant with that just out of the oven freshness. I could have inhaled an entire portion by myself, but of course, these were all shared between 3-4 people. The drinks were nice in taste but light on alcohol, which wasn't really an issue since this isn't the kind of venue to drink heavily. They also followed the overall trend of small portions for high prices, even taking the location and ambiance into consideration. I just can't justify it, especially as our per-person price was well above three figures each. I'm starting to notice a trend with my opinions of seemingly highly-rated, pricey, upscale restaurants in coveted areas. It might be a while before I try another, but chances are I won't be coming back to La Mar.

My now fiance and I were celebrating our 2 anniversary in SF and he found this amazing restaurant. We are always on the hunt for unique cuisines and this Japanese Peruvian restaurant is right up our alley. The restaurant itself is beautiful...right on the water! It was very busy on a Friday night but we were seated right away. Our server took the time to explain the menu to us since we had no idea what we were ordering. He suggested the ceviche tasting and the trio of sashimi. I didn't think it would be enough food but we were stuffed! The fish was so incredibly fresh and the different sauces that accompanied each fish were so unique. Their famous "leche de tigre" sauce is amazing. I've never had anything like it! Be advised that most of the sauces are pretty spicy. For dessert, we had the hazelnut passion fruit mousse. It was sooo good!!! Not too sweet and with a tang. Overall, this place is worth the money just because the fish is so fresh. The service is a bit slow, but it is a good way to relax and enjoy the food. We will be back!

For anyone who loves Peru and misses the food, this place will be a hit. Flavorful, tasty, nice portions, ceviches, empanadas and lomo saltado ( you must try and best in SF). Sangria is great and so is Pisco Sour. It's pricey so kep that in mind but worth the coin. Great for birthday or special date.

This restaurant is located at the building next to the Ferry Building on Pier 1 1/2. We came here to celebrate my sister's birthday. I loved the environment and the whole look of the restaurant. The table mats were full of color and the tables were spacious enough for our party of 7. To start dinner off, we were given two buckets of plantain chips with a green sauce. The plantain chips tasted like tortilla chips/potato chips and the green sauce had a familiar taste. The green sauce tasted exactly like the sauce they serve at Mexican restaurants for your burritos! It was a nice light snack before our meal.My sister kept telling us that the portions were large when in fact they were nothing close. It was mostly small plates and quite expensive for what it was.. seriously, we spent probably about $200ish on the following:- 2x mixto - cebiche that included a mixture of the catch of the day, calamari, octopus, shrimp. This was probably my favorite thing we had! ($19/ea)- yuquitas - crispy yucca croquettes in a rocoto huancaina sauce. Meh, it just tasted like regular ol' potatoes ($9).- beef / chicken empanadas - Overpriced for their taste ($14-15).- arroz la mar - shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, vegetables, and arborio rice. If you like paella, this is similar. My family liked the flavor. However, I did not ($34)- 2x lomo saltado - traditional Peruvian style beef tenderloin, tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, soy and oyster sauce, potatoes, and rice. Honestly, there were barely any meat pieces. They seriously skimped out. I felt like there was way too much of the potatoes and onions. It tasted like a dish at a Chinese restaurant, so I wasn't too amazed by the taste. My sister raved about it, having tried it at another restaurant, but I was disappointed ($36/ea).- some shrimp ball things with a green sauce over it; not sure where this is on the menuThe food is average and not worth the money in my opinion. Portions are small and you can easily rack up a bill on ordering just a couple things!

Unfortunately this restaurant fell into the category of amazing the 1st time and disappointing the 2nd. Don't get me wrong the food was delicious but the service was incredibly slow - starting at the check in to the finishing of entrees - despite having a 5:45 reservation.In addition, although the ceviches and caucus tastings tasted great, portions seemed smaller and therefore expensive. The salmon was so memorable last time but what happened! Seems like there were less veggies and the coconut curry sauce was more of a broth - liquidy and thin. As for the skewer tastings, we substituted the beef one for an extra Mahi Mahi skewer (so 2 fish and 1 chicken). The sauce that came on the chicken skewer was delicious and I loved the charred veggies on them but the fish and chicken themselves were nothing amazing. Lots of sauce and not enough protein for $30+. Too many fingerling potatoes on the side also ... would have preferred some colorful sweet potatoes or cauliflower instead.In other words, I would recommend this place of it's your first time but I'm ready to try other places.

Highly recommend the outdoor seating if it's available- really beautiful view of the pier. I love Peruvian food so was well acquainted with most of the classics on the menu. Our table tried a few different things including the ceviche sampler plate, the ahi tuna with whipped potato and the yucca balls for appetizers. I wasn't too crazy about the tuna and the other japanese-esque ceviche but everything else was amazing. Chicha morada tasted great as well. For main course, I tried the octopus skewer and the catch of the day (swordfish)- both were cooked perfectly and went well with the side dishes/garnishes they came with. For dessert, we had the passionfruit chocolate mousse and it was fantastic: not too chocolatey, but a good amount of rich fruity flavor.La Mar isn't cheap but would definitely come back for a nice dinner or occasion

Amazing drinks, many different selections for ceviche. Their seafood is very fresh. We had the lomo saltado (always great). Parking was available at pier 3, a one minute walk away for good rates. Easily accessible by bart also. Will definitely be coming back here.

Absolutely delicious. Excellent service. We come once a year. Their menu is seasonal so there are slight changes every time. The mushroom empanadas are the best I've ever had, second are the corn empanadas. No free refills on soft drinks (FYI). Last year we had ceviche appetizer and it was perfect. Definitely worth the price. Recommend reservations.

Came here for my birthday dinner and it was aweeesomeee. I'm not even that big of a fish person and I thought the Halibut ceviche was so delicious. The corn and chicken empanada were also pretty bomb and flavorful. I thought the lomo saltado was great, perfectly cooked and exceptional as well. The menu is a little confusing at first but after you spend some time with it you get the hang of the layout. They also have an amazing pisco sour and prickly pear margarita (it's not sweet at all). Took a while for the drinks to come. Our server was really nice and helpful but kind of disappeared as the meal went on. Still had an awesome experience and I'll definitely be back.

I have visited La Mar quite a few times, as I work nearby in the area. First off, the happy hour is amazing - definitely order the ceviche. They do not skimp on fish, and portions are the same as the regular menu.I have ordered the following other food:-Lomo Saltado: A bit salty for my taste (and I love salt..), and a bit oily. Otherwise, it is very good. Meat is cooked well. 3/5- Pork Fried Rice (can't remember the Peruvian name): This is very good and I'd get it again in a heartbeat. It comes in a sizzling stone bowl topped with egg. The meat and seafood inside are perfectly cooked, not dry at all. The chili sauce is amazing. 5/5-Scallops Sashimi: Yum! Interesting presentation and accompanying flavors. I would recommend. 4/5- Ceviche sampler: 3 kinds of ceviche, all very fresh and flavorful, though I feel the ceviche with the orange sauce was a bit overpowered with sauce. 4/5- Plantain chips: YUMMMMMMM YES .. more please :) 5/5- Pisco Sour: Strong, flavorful, top notch. 4.5/5Service was attentive and friendly. Atmosphere was a little lackluster, but not horrible. Restaurant could use a little more pizzaz/decoration.

La Mar is a top shelf experience. I must humble myself and admit I did not know Peruvian cuisine has a Japanese influence. If you like raw fish (sushi lovers take note) and you like some spice La Mar is hands down a dining experience. You can dine in either the chic dining room or on the less formal covered patio either is a treat.

VERY pricey, but good place. We were able to get in here on Father's Day with no wait. We basically had the taster of everything- the ceviches, emapanadas, sashimi, etc. All of it was delicious, but the portions were really small. The sauces, flavors, etc. were fantastic and the service was great. I don't remember our server's name but he was great and provided tons of information. In the end though, the high cost and small portion size take off a star. Go here if you want a fancy Peruvian meal on the water but be prepared for a large bill!

I went here with my family, and it was superb.The food was very good - light and refreshing. The space is beautiful, and above all - the service was perfect. Gilberto treated us like family, and we felt that our every need was treated with care. It was a lovely evening, and we left feeling full and happy.

This is a review of the bar. Amazing place for happy hour fun times, open every day even on July 4, for $6 wine and $7 cocktails. Delicious empanadas at $6 and mini quinoa burgers for $8 and the staff are super friendly and made special gluten free options for my friend. Drinks are strong but don't taste like it, Cosy design which always manages to seat you, a hidden treasure in peak touristville.

There are two ways to perceive my experience at La Mar. The first is from the perception that I have been to the original La Mar in Mira Flores, Peru. In comparison, the San Francisco location was a complete disappointment. There was nothing that resembled authentic Peru at this location. In fact, I was all together disappointed with the entire experience up until I had the anticuchos (beef heart.) The seasoning on the anticuchos was authentic, delicious, and clearly Peruvian. Those were the highlight of our meal. However, from an American perspective, it was an elegant classy restaurant. The service was polite and welcoming. The ambiance was elegant, but a little boring. It lacked theme and direction. We ordered a series of cebiches and seafood entrees. None of them were memorable. Not even the pisco sours were memorable, which was very unfortunate. Case and point, my server did not even know what "aji" was, which is a prevalent hot sauce throughout Peru.Sadly, there are several restaurants in San Francisco that I would recommend before this one.

Awesome place for ceviche and seafood in general!! I had a bit of everything by doing a family style lunch with my friends and it was amazing! Definitely a pricey place, but worth a try! :) Ceviche, empanadas, octopus, fried rice... all were tasty.

When coming to a place where I am spending over $100 on dinner for two (price excluding drinks) I expect to be wowed throughout my dining experience. The yucca chips were wow. The appetizers - mushrooms and cheese empanadas and the crab cakes were wow. The main course dishes we ordered (salmon plate and the seafood causa) were both mediocre. It was served lukewarm and flavors were not spectacular. Simply said, with all the hype surrounding this place, I expected much more from the main dish!

More like a 3.5. Came here with my parents for lunch. We had the la mar burger, the chicken burger, and the fish skewers. Don't come here expecting authentic Peruvian food. You'll be disappointed. BUT, the food was good, just overpriced. Service was really great and the view was amazing.

La Mar has been and continues to be one of my favorite restaurants! I was in the area recently and decided to give their happy hour a try and was not disappointed! So good! My only wish is that they add more of their fabulous ceviches to the happy hour menu! The empanadas are the best! Great cocktails, too!

Decided to go and have dinner on a saturday night without previous reservation. We had to wait just a little but they were very accommodating. The food, drinks, ambience and staff was great. Had a wonderful time. We really loved everything about our unplanned date night. We'll for sure come back.

Pros:- Great ambience & service. Very classy fare in a rather touristy area.- Wide array of seafood options, with their cebiche being a specialityCons- On the pricier side and portions are small- Very limited vegetarian options...and they aren't very filling. Tip: make a reservation in advance...otherwise a 30-40 minute wait!

I have never had Peruvian food before, and I don't know what I was doing with my life until now, but this was so so good. The food was amazing, I haven't tasted flavors like this before! I'm so happy they had enough vegetarian options.The restaurant is beautiful too, seeing the bay bridge all lit up at night was so cute and pretty. Portions are pretty decent, but I ordered a lot and still ate everything, so maybe it depends on your mood. But it will be expensive. I did not like our server though. He was just really pushy and rude and that bothered me a lot. Even the people at the front desk were kind of rude, but the food was so good I want to give this 5 stars instead of 4. Will update my review though if I go back and have to deal with mean people again because that's not fun and no one wants to eat dinner and be sad.
