No service! I had bookings for lunch and after being seated, never had a waiter even look my way. I left after waiting 15 minutes. We came before a theatre performance a previous time and it was nearly the same. The management needs to address this or their ratings will continue to go down. Very disappointing.

Came in for a brunch with my girlfriend, her friend and his wife. We are visiting from DC, and have a different understanding of brunch than most places, but this place was great!Started off with drinks and guacamole. Delicious quick guacamole served with warm corn tortillas that were made fresh. We ordered the Heuvos Rancheros, Tacos a la Mexicano, Desayuno Breakfast and Eggs Benedict. The Huevos Rancheros were delicious. Had a great black bean puree served with it as well. The salsas we're a little lacking. We asked for a hot salsa to add a little more heat to our food, but it was more tangy than anything. Would definitely recommend this place!

Been coming here for four years. It's a favorite for out of town guests as well. It's upscale and the menu reflects a more upscale ideal. In my opinion the food lives up to expectations. I almost always get the ceviche which is fresh and abundant. I recently had the pork adobado. It was incredible with crispy pork skin and succulent meat inside. I've never had a bad dish and I look forward to my next visit.

The only reason I am even giving this place one star is because of the buser and the hostess. Our server was anything but pleasant and the management is awful. The worst experience my family and I have ever had at a restaurant.

Location: close to the mall and a lot of offices on market. The inside is pretty dark and cramped. Service: I went with a big group and service was pretty good. The food came out super slowly though! Food: -Guac: delicious, ask for it extra spicy if you want. -Camarones en Mole: really good, though there weren't enough shrimp! The corn cake was like a soft piece of cornbread. -Elote: unfortunately, this was really bad. I was looking forward to it but it was barely even grilled and just tasted off. I probably wouldn't come here again, especially since the portions aren't great for the prices.

I ordered steak which tasted like some old ass chewy meat and top it off, it was placed on mash potato that tasted like it came from out of a box. The most basic platter was just confusing to like since the chipotle overrode the tasteless chewy meat. The ambiance was ok, nothing special !What I did like was the service and the sangria. I would come back because of these two great aspects of this restaurant. Just wouldn't order any food.

Always have to preface my reviews with: I'm not typically a fan of mexican food.Usually if you're looking for mexican food you want to go to the mission. This was more tex mex but pretty decent actually. The tortillas they bring with the salsa at the beginning was probably the best part of the meal. I also ordered fish tacos which came with those same tortillas so I was pretty full at the end of the meal. Service was great. I believe our waitress was Brooke

Let's start with the fact that there are $14 bottomless mimosas. One of the best deals in the city!The food: delicious, a great mix of traditional Mexican breakfast and some innovative twists on things. I got the chilaquiles (okay it's one of my staples) and although presented fancier than I normally have it myself, still tasted like exactly what I was looking for. They also bring out tortillas with some fun dipping sauces that I think are all made in-house.Mimosas have the perfect OJ and champagne proportions, meaning they are orange but you aren't left wondering if there is even any champagne in there!The service: wonderful! Personable staff who knew their menu well. Came by to fill up our mimosas again often.Another reason this spot is a gem: it was 12pm on a Saturday and not crowded - we didn't even have to wait! Check out this amazing deal before the rest of the city finds out about it.

Overall: The place looks great from the outside. When we arrived and opened the doors, I saw a rat run its life along the bar seats. I had this "ugh" look. Don't ask why we didn't leave. Food: I ordered the pepito and it was ok. It was $15 but the portion was small. It would have been nice if it had rice and beans to fill up. I'm on a diet, but something more than just my little sandwich would have been nice

Went with one of my friends to this supposedly upscale restaurant last night. What a costly mistake it was!. We can get a taco bowl just about anywhere. I can recognize good Mexican food and this wasn't the case. I ordered the Camarones en Mole and got just a few pieces of small shrimp. They tasted good though, it came with a corn cake which tasted like cornbread. After that I had a small bowl of Pozole which wasn't bad either but wasn't hot enough.Can we all agree that amateurs should not run a restaurant in the City nor should they be in a zone where the highest rated restaurants are located. The moral of this story is... start small and then move up. Maybe, buy a taco truck in East Oakland then move to a better location.

One of my faves since 2005.Handmade corn tortillas, their salsa sampler (that mango pineapple salsa slays), the guacamole made at your table, the chilaquiles verdes, the endless tequila selection.I can't 5-star them, because the churros are no longer on point. They taste and look like the frozen kind. So disappointing! They used to serve up crispy deliciousness that tasted fresh, just like the kind the churro guy serves up from his little cart on some random corner in Tijuana in the Revolucion neighborhood. Freshly made churros are crispy on the outside, flaky like a mutha, and have soft, chewy, tender masa on the inside that renders you helpless the minute you savor it. The chocolate dipping sauce that used to accompany them, was equally delightful as well. Bring 'em back, Colibri!

We were visiting SF and were looking for a nearby restaurant close to the hotel where we were staying in Union Square. Based on the positive reviews, we decided to give this place a try. We didn't have reservations (recommended) so we waited about 30 minutes for a table. The menu is not a typical Mexican restaurant and is somewhat limited. However, everyone in our party enjoyed their dishes. The service was a bit slow and the prices a bit high but we definitely enjoyed our meal.

Went to watch a broadway show across the street. Stopped by here for brunch Sunday afternoon. We had made a reservation and when we got there they took us right away. Glad we made a reservation it was a packed place. Ambiance - awesome. Well lit, friendly,attentive and happy servers. Good options for vegetarians. Food came out quick and it was flavorful We had the bottomless mimosas which we found to be a little on the weaker side. But they were bottomless so hey no complaints . If you are in the city with friends do stop by you'll enjoy the experience.

Great mimosas but subpar food. Very very very disappointed given the number of positive reviews around. Also the $10 bottomless mimosa is a thing of the past.

5 stars for the food. It was outstanding. The salsas are very unique and served with both fresh corn tortillas and chips. I had the Tortita de Papas for dinner, amazing and so flavorful. 0 stars for service. This is about as bad as it gets. We sat at our table for 10-15 minutes before anyone came over. At one point, we were staring at three salsas and a bowl of guacamole with no chips or tortillas, took 15 minutes to get those. Had to ask for utensils and water refills. I also asked for more salsa, which never came. The food here is so insanely tasty, that it might be worth coming to again, despite the terrible service.

This is a solid option just a couple blocks from Union Square. It is not too expensive and the food is good. The decor is interesting and it has a good sized bar.We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and mains and go family style. It is not family style place, but it worked well for us. We started with a few appetizers, Empanadas and Queso Fundido Con Chorizo. The empanadas were good and consists of baked turnovers filled with ground pork, onions, garlic, roasted peppers, served with chipotle-tomato sauce, fresco, cheese and chipotle sour cream. The empanadas themselves were a little bland, but the sauce helped make them good. The queso was tasty and had large chunks of chorizo in it. I enjoyed it a lot.For mains we chose Filet Mignon and Carnitas. Both were solid. I enjoyed them, but felt they both could have used more flavor or seasoning. The goat cheese with the filet did help though, as did the salsa with the carnitas.

Nob Hill/ TL never disappoints with their choices of restaurants and new food spots. This restaurant is found right below hotel Diva and two doors up from Katanaya Ramen place.When here on a Thursday night and was surprised on how cozy the restaurant looks. I was pleasantly surprised.This place has a vast array of Tequila offerings, they actually have a menu just for tequilas.In terms of food I wasn't really impressed but if there's a WoW item, it has to be with the ELOTE, The grilled corn.. Just heavenly.My friends and I shared the Guacamole, came to us in this rustic stone container that was huge. Ironically, once I dogged a spoon in it. It was so shallow that 1 person wouldn't be satisfied. Lol another thing that bothered me is the guacamole doesn't come with chips. Our server mentioned that aside from the $12 guacamole, chips are $2. She also mentioned that they do have soft tacos that are home made but is unlimited.It also seems that they don't have a set menu, what you see online is no necessarily what they offer every night. My group go to try their Mole, Duck, and Carnitas.Mole - Absolutely NO! Imagine a sauce out of burned pans- that's how it tasted.. And I'm being nice.Duck - divine, they rendered all the fat making the skin crisp and duck heavenlyCarnitas - if you're looking for bang for your buck, this is it. Nothing special but very filling.I probably come back just for a Cocktail with the ELOTE. It's that good.

College BFF & I came here recently for old times' sake. I wasn't even a Yelper the last time we ate here! Colibri serves weekend brunch until 2pm, which I so appreciate because by the time we got our act together on Saturday, it was 11:30 & places that did offer breakfast had already stopped doing so. CBFF ordered Huevos Benedictinos estilo Michoacan; replace English muffins with corn shells and substitute carnitas for ham & you've got a better version of Eggs Benedict. I loved my order of chilaquiles with rojo sauce washed down with a limey, spicy michelada. One of the most mouthwatering items came gratis -- small corn tortillas made in-house with a trio of amazing salsas. Colibri, you'll be seeing us again!

Extremely overpriced and the food is certainly not all that. Also, the staff is not attentive whatsoever. We were never given utensils or napkins, we had to ask for these bare necessities. After taking our first bite of food and instantly getting our hands dirty, it's Mexican food, I asked for "napkins" and the waiter returns with ONE napkin... so are my boyfriend and I supposed to share one napkin?? We had to ask for another one. Will definitely not be returning to this establishment.

Had brunch here on Saturday and it was delicious!!! Started with bottomless mimosas, fresh tortillas and salsa, and guacamole and chips - all amazing. For main courses, I got the chilaquiles which were delicious. My friends got the enchiladas and carnitas omelette, and they said both were great. I think there's a 2 hour time limit on bottomless mimosas but they were very generous with them and when we finished eating, they didn't make us feel bad about staying for another hour to drink! Can't wait to come here again!

Was looking forward to amazing Carnitas which I've enjoyed here many times before. The first time they came around the pork was raw (not pink, chewy raw in the center).

The rice and the cocktail were very good, but overall a disappointing experience this time around.

I would have given this place 4 stars if the service had been much better than it was today. I booked a table for a party of 8 for lunch and, when I arrived, they did not have the booking and had to get a table prepared for us. Fortunately, my party was not there yet so the wait for the table was quite ok. I booked two weeks ago so no reason why they would not have expected us. The inside of this place is nice looking and has an open kitchen where you can see the staff preparing the food. The tables & chairs are quite comfortable. They have a great big bar at the front of the place and it was well stocked. On weekends they only have a brunch menu and we were limited in what we could order. I chose the carnitas omelette and it came with beans, roasted potato and tender pulled beef filling in an omelette. I loved it and was very satisfied with the flavours. The food here gets 4 stars from me :-)) The fresh orange juice was also very nice. The service was very slow and we had to ask each and every time for one thing or another. With a bit of improvement here they would be 4 stars for me. The waitress was nice and polite but simple things like, I will bring you chips and salsa for the table but it never arrived ;-)) instead she put tacos on the table for the meal or, coffee took about 20 mins for 8 people and they had a small amount of espresso cups so some of us got an espresso in a big coffee cup ;-)) I would come back here again. The food is good and tasty and the ambience is nice. It's also priced quite ok.

Saturday morning brunch was very good. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservations and we were seated right away. All 3 of us ordered bottomless mimosas, which we all really liked. At first they were a little slow to refill our cups, but as the day went they picked it up and never had an empty cup.We shared a guacamole to begin. It was very good and it came with salsa and tortillas. The tortillas are homemade and very delicious. For 12 dollars, the guacamole was a very good portion, and we also really liked all 3 of their salsas.I ordered the chilaquiles, verdes. I really liked them and it was a good portion. Highly recommend this place for brunch in San Francisco.

Apparently people that eat here have never tried authentic Mexican food. No offense to anyone but the reviews are so misleading. Not only was the food not pleasant the prices are way to off. The TORTILLAS looked more like a "guarache" ( thick undercooked tortilla) The fish tacos were very poor in presentation and in flavor, it said it had chipotle cream but the chipotle looked like a yellow watery sauce. The CHILE RELLENO stuffed with veggies was tasteless. The CEVICHE looked and taste like an ordinary ceviche nothing special , the tortilla soup was awful. To be honest the plates looked so so so good in the pictures, I had to eat my food because I was starving. I didn't enjoy my experience.

Food was very good, namely the homemade tortilla and guac, the Mexican corn, fish tacos, and filet mignon. So I'm sad to give this place just 3 stars for several reasons. Service was not good, as many people mentioned in previous reviews. It was not busy at all during early dinner and the servers were nowhere to be found for at least 5 minutes when we wanted another glass of wine or more food.Portions are decent, but prices are high. They give you homemade tortillas with guacamole, which was tasty, but they charged us $2 for extra chips.We were seated in a table that is next to the bar and it got a bit crowded when people were walking by.They could seriously improve this place in many ways! I don't think we are going back even though the food was good.

The service was great. Everyone that works there is very welcoming. The food on the other hand was absolutely uneatable. We ordered Guacamole and found two long blonde hairs in it. We didn't say anything. Then the food came and both plates were drenched in a bitter, over powering uneatable sauce. Colibri is definitely not a michelin star restaurant. I think the reason people keep going back to this place is not for the food but rather for the cocktails, drinks, Spanish music and ambient.

This was not a good experience. From service to food it was all pretty bad. The only thing decent was the guacamole and chips but getting enough chips was a chore. Drinks too FOREVER to come. The fish tacos were terrible- pineapple with a mayo based sauce. I feel like I get what they were trying for- something I've had poolside at a carribean resort but completely missed the mark. And the "chile relleno" was a cooked pepper with some cheese. Not battered, no sauce. And did I say service was terrible? Not worth the stop.

For our entrees I had the shrimp mole which was very savory and the corn cake was perfectly soft and sweet. My boyfriend had the tortita de papas which he really enjoyed.

Met up with an old friend for lunch here a while backWe ordered the guacamole to start and for my main entree I got the carne asada plateWhile I did appreciate they served fresh made tortillas with their guacamole I was puzzled by why they charged for the chips considering how rather pedestrian they were. I would rather pay for the tortillas, at least those were worth getting. Yes, you read correctly, you have to pay $2 for chips to go with your salsa/guacamole. Also, it feels rather "tacky" to serve the guacamole in plastic bowls inside the stone stands, last I check Rose Mexicano doesn't even do that. Anyways, on to the steak, the cut was decent and cooked well but needed more salt. The essence of chipotle peppers were their but would have liked a bigger punch. The accompany sides were fine but no stand outs. Overall ThoughtsI've had better mexican food at fraction of the cost

Review is for dinner on a Sunday evening, 2 people around 6:30p.Environment: pretty for a date, fun for familiesAppetizers:- empanadas: wonderful, great crust and filling. Equal amounts of both for balance.- free corn tortillas when you sit down, with 3 salsas: YUMMMM! I've never eaten tortillas that are pillowing soft! Mains:- Husband had the filet. It looked small but was filling. Excellent cut of meat, almost crispy on the outside and perfectly medium rare inside. Again, all favors had balance.- Carnitas for me; love the big and crispy chunks of pork, with very spicy salsa in the side. Small scoop of rice (which was fine by me after eating so many tortillas!).Service:- Main server was OK. She got our order wrong a few times but maybe it was an off day. Everyone from the hostess to the other waitstaff were amazing!Repeat business?: yes, would definitely go back!

Good food and great service. Arguably the BEST guacamole I've ever had -- ask for spicy. Even their salads were great and zesty. If you're in SF and jonesing for Mexican, this is the spot.
