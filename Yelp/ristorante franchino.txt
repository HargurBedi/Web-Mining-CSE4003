After wandering around Chinatown and Nob Hill area of SF on a Sunday evening and working up a good appetite, Franchino was decided for dinner. I'm happy to report that this wasn't a regrettable decision, in fact, I want to share my wonderful experience.Apparently most people have reservations for this place, but luck was on my side for a table of 2 around 7pm as a walk-in.I ordered the linguine con vongole, which is basically clam linguine with small bacon bites sprinkled in the dish. I loved that the pasta wasn't dry, the light sauce didn't make me feel guilty or sluggish after the meal. I also ate the Pasta Primavera with chicken. I'm not sure what's in the tomato sauce, but it's not your typical tomato sauce, I was licking my plate. The chicken was also very tender and everything paired well.The restaurant is small in size, big groups might be difficult, but the setup is easy for conversations. Service was excellent, ambiance was great, restroom was clean, I hope to come back again soon!

Yum! This is a great mom&pop restaurant in north beach. I visited with my family on a sanfran weekend trip and would definitely come back. Service: 5/5 Restaurant: small, expect a wait if in a group 4+ and at peak hours; they take limited reservations each dayFood: Clams in garlic sauce: 4/5 delicious broth, good amount of clamsPappardelle with sausage special: 5/5 This was the favorite of the table! The pasta was fresh and sauce was mouthwateringly deliciousGnocchi: 4/5- we asked to get the three sauce version which was perfect so we could try all three types of sauces!Penne amatriciana: 4/5- I've been obsessed with this dish since visiting Rome and this was delicious but not my favorite iterationPro tip: if you're hungry and waiting you can order appetizers/drinks while you wait!

Josephine the owner knows how to bring the feeling of the old country to the states. From the trattoria style corner restaurant to the last bite of desert with your coffee! Wow! This place is a hidden gem. The food is fresh. Prepared properly and served up quick. Not to mention. In my opinion, you get a 5 star meal for a 2 star price. This place simply has things figured out. I went the last two times I was in San Fran and I will be back every time. Love it! Keep up the great work!

Came here for dinner, and it was a wonderful experience! This place is a small and family-owned, and it has such a warm atmosphere! We were promptly seated, and our waitress was super friendly- she said her mom was the one cooking everything! Also, someone in our group ordered a small bottle of pelligrino, but they only had the big bottles, so they gave her a big one for the price of one!Now to the food- we started with the prosciutto melone. It comes with 4 slices of melon wrapped in prosciutto. I think for the price I would've expected a couple more pieces, but it was tasty and refreshing. For entrees, I got one of the special pastas, rigatoni with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and a sauce with a touch of blue cheese. It was supposed to be served with fresh pappardelle instead of the rigatoni, but they were all out of the pappardelle! The dish was delicious though! Other dishes we ordered were the special ravioli filled with braised beef and spinach, the chicken piccata, and the veal parmesan. We all loved our food! The only thing I'd ding them for is the specials were on the pricey side for the portions ($22). Regardless though, we all really enjoyed our dinner here and would definitely come back!

There are so many Italian restaurants in North Beach and especially on Columbus. My daughter found Franchino on Yelp and we called to make sure they were open on New Year night. Luckily for us they were open. We walk in and it's a nice small restaurant decorated with wine bottles, Christmas lights and a bunch of family pictures. I love family own businesses. Nice fancy tables. Some of the tables are pretty close together but I just loved the Italian vibe. We started off with the Bruschetta. They give you four pieces on a bed of lettuce and green olives. They stack up high with diced tomatoes and olive oil. I thought it was pretty good. Not great but good. I had the Veal Marsala with grilled vegetables. It came with three thinly sliced veal covered in Marsala sauce and mushrooms. I thought it was pretty good. Sauce was okay and the veal was cooked perfectly. I loved the grilled vegetables. Cooked just right. It had Brussel sprouts, carrots, green beans. Really good. My wife and daughter shared the Spaghetti Al Ragu with a sausage sauce. They both really liked it. Wasn't a very big plate but enough for them. They were both satisfied. My son got the Linguine Con Vongole which is basically with clams in the shell and he added chicken. He was raving about this. Really liked it. He wasn't happy about going out for Italian tonight cause he wanted sushi but after he had this dish he was really happy. To end our meal, I got a cappuccino and we decided to share a Spinoni. It was dipped in chocolate, had a cherry on top with an Italian flag on top. We asked if they made this and the lady said that this was imported from Italy. I got to tell you this was so good. It had chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. I know those are basic flavors but it was really good. Melt in your mouth goodness. So good. So overall, the service was really good. Really liked the older lady serving us. Nice lady. The food was really good. Outstanding. Then the Italian family vibe. Really liked it. Could hear the staff talking with some of the customers and you can tell they have a lot of regular customers. If I lived here I would be one of their regular customers too. So enjoy. We did

Walking all over San Fran for great Italian food and stumbled upon this gem. Home made pasta cooked al dente. Great service with a visit from mama who earlier that day made her own pasta. Finished the night off with panna cotta topped with a strawberry sauce and a glass of Port. I very rarely write reviews but this place deserved one. I really enjoyed my dinner and down time with my family after a day of sightseeing. Thanks Franchino!

Whoa, that was a delicious experience! Out of the many options in the area, we thankfully landed here.Two of us shared the Bruschetta, tri-color Gnocchi Della Casa, and the Veal Marsala. I can try and describe the experience but you really must try it; like I've heard of soft, pillowy gnocchi but tasting is another story.The brushcetta was bright and flavorful, gnocchi was smooth and we enjoyed being able to try 3 of their sauces, and the veal marsala was fireeeee. The marsala wine sauce was so succulent we almost forgot about the tender veal.Overall, it was a great experience. The restaurant is small but has a comforting vibe and the service was great. I'm convinced that anything out of that kitchen will be just as good.

Wow, this place is great! A cute, small, family-owned gem in little Italy that's not to be missed. Their pasta was fresh, homemade and delicious. I had the gnocchi which was light and fluffy - the way you want it to be. My boyfriend had the spaghetti carbonara and it was the best he's had - made with egg, pancetta, onion, no cream! Definitely worth a stop.

"What's fresh today?" That's what my tall, part-Italian date asked as soon as we sat down. This spot is one of his favorites in town. And as the server listed off all the fresh pasta of the day, I absorbed all the feels of this place. It has small, family home feel that's so welcoming, you can't go wrong with anything you get.I forgot what I ordered but I remember my date's lasagna. Whoa, how can I get more of that without getting enormous from a carb overload? Definitely the right pick when you want to say "forget it" to your diet.Grab a bottle of wine to share and call it a perfect night!

The only better Italian food I've had was in Italy. I enjoyed the "gnocchi special" an off-menu dish that was essentially gnocchi ravioli stuffed with cheese and mushrooms. It was so rich and delicious I would definitely make another trip to the city to try other menu items. Even the coffee following the meal was perfect, rich and smooth, not bitter at all. Best Italian food I have had in the US hands down

I'm married to an Italian.He is picky about his Italian food and what tastes authentically Italian.We always wander the North Beach district when we are in SF looking for the hike in the walls that look family owned.A few years ago we were walking down Columbus and encountered a man in a suit and fedora outside his restaurant calling out to passersby and bursting into opera.That got our attention.We were quickly seated and introduced to his wife and daughters.I ordered seafood pasta and hubby asked for whatever she wanted to make him.She chose homemade sausage dish.It was pure,pure, awesomeness and now we never ever go anywhere else for Italian food when we are in the city.I wish that they were open for lunch.

Easily the BEST Italian food I've ever had at a restaurant and that's saying a lot, given that I'm Sicilian. Seriously, the food is as good as my grandma's cooking was. After eating at quite a few Italian restaurants in North Beach, I can comfortably say that this is now my go-to place. The pasta is freshly-made, the appetizers (try the grilled, marinated vegetables!) are amazing, the sauces are always delectable and the customer service is second-to-none. The three wonderful women who run the place are ALWAYS friendly, full of suggestions and make you feel like you just stepped into your grandmother's home for Sunday night dinner. I look forward to going to San Francisco JUST so I can eat at Franchino! Don't let the high prices at other restaurants trick you into thinking their food is better. At Franchino, they're able to serve delicious, homestyle food at affordable prices.Just writing this review makes me hungry for Franchino. Can't wait to visit them again when I head up to San Francisco this weekend!P.S. If you're craving dessert, ask for the bomba. You won't regret it!

This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the city and the only place outside of my Grandmother's house where I will actually clean the plate of all sauce as well as pasta. I have tried numerous Italian places throughout San Francisco and it has never been topped. Everything here is fresh made and incredible. Owned (and run) by an Italian family who does the cooking. Their hospitality is excellent and the food is out of this world. Order some wine. Order some pasta. Order some dessert and coffee. Enjoy the small intimate setting and the perfect ambiance. And forget, just for a second, that you aren't actually in Italy.

I stepped in here for a very early dinner at the recommendation of a SFPD officer. He said this restaurant was the last of the old mom and pop restaurants and he was right!! We ordered the appetizer sampler which I don't recall being on the menu but since we wanted to try a little of everything our sweet server happily obliged us!I had the clam linguini as I always do at an Italian restaurant! It's my go to dish and register of how good an Italian restaurant is. Anyways, the homemade noodles were amazing! They held the white wine and olive oil so well. The clams were all fresh and I would have ordered a second to go had I not been getting on a plane!The best part of this restaurant though, was the mother and owner of the restaurant. She was very friendly and made us feel welcomed! I took their business card with the hope that I visit and eat here again!!Delicious!!

We have been to Franchino every time we've visited San Francisco over the last 5-6 years. It is a family owned business and the food and service is always exceptional. Sadly, we discovered today that the old proprietor who used to regale us with Ole Sole Mio passed away a few months ago, but the food and ambience was outstanding. The gnocchi here is the best I've ever had. Enjoy!

The family/staff are all about making you feel at home - the kind of place where they might pull up a chair with you. Good wine list. Only 14 tables. Definitely save room for dessert.

Review #950You had me at homemade pappardelle w/sausage. That was the special that night that we came and boy was I a happy camper. The sauce was robust and flavorful but did lean towards the saltier end. The addition of the sausage helped to amplify the dish even further. My only call out would be that the noodle was overcooked and veered on the softer side. Side note, you can order the gnoochi dish with sauces half and half. Gnoochi was well made, lite and airy with a toothy biteSeating is limited and tight but it is fitting with the charming ambiance they have createdOverall ThoughtsFeels like a mom and pop Italian restaurant transplanted straight out of Italy

This place was amazing... a mom and pop shop with only a handful of tables and traditional Italian dishes. My husband and I had a 20+ minute conversation with "momma" who had just finished hand-making the pappardelle noodles for the special that evening. Ordered the pappardelle special, which was MIND-BLOWING, and the gnocchi (dressed 1/3 wth tomato sauce, 1/3 with pesto sauce and 1/3 with the best and lightest creamy sauce that I've ever had). Truly an awesome meal and an even better experience! Will be coming back on our next visit to the City!

Went to franchino last night with a few friends who are big big fans. It's an adorable family fun place with a very cozy vibe. Ordered the spaghetti con calamari and my husband got the risotto in tomato sauce. Both were absolutely decadent. Our friends had the fettuccine Alfredo which was delicious but too creamy to my liking. The special gnocchi was delicious. Like little pillows of heaven. Ended with the tiramisu which was alright. Sweeter than most. I wasn't a big fan. The servers (the daughters of the lady who cooks) were wonderful. They very carefully explained the special, the veggie alternatives they could do and the pairings. It was all in all a great place. One of my favourites.

Had dinner here Saturday night. A nice family owned sweet little place. Has a few tables and walk ins only. Call in a day earlier if you want to make reservations.We started with the bruschetta, minestrone soup, prosciutto with melons, and a special that consisted of buratta cheese with eggplant. The best bruschetta ever. The minestrone was flavorful but light on heat. The eggplant didn't look or taste like eggplant and I am not complaining. The appetizers turned out to be pretty filling, so we got 3 entrees to share among 4 people. We got the risotto with salmon, the gnocchi with pesto, and penne primavera with veggies. All were awesome. My favorite was the risotto. I loved that the salmon wasn't overpowering. Portion sizes are pretty good, and sharing worked for us.We ended with an icecream dessert- a chocolate icecream with a filling of vanilla and hazelnut icecream. It was spectacular. Loved everything

This is quite possibly the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to in the States. I had the Spaghetti Carbonara, but dining with others I sampled their dishes. The Carbonara is very tasty, simple, straight forward. The lasagna had the best cheesy crust and amazing combination of flavors. The Mushroom risotto had a wonderful earthy taste and creamy texture with perfectly cooked risotto. The Fettuccini Alfredo? The best I have ever had, hands down. It gave me chills. Don't tell mama, this Alfredo is better than hers. Stop here. The space is small, the wait may be long, but you will not have such an amazing meal anywhere else. Wait, no matter how long the line. Review summarized: Amazing food, better than your mama makes it.

I like to think of myself as a food snob. But then again, I am one of those people who thinks Olive Garden is a great destination for "authentic" Italian food. After my experience at Franchino, Franchino has replaced Olive Garden as my measurement for delicious Italian food. I have walked through Little Italy, SF many many times in my lifetime and I never knew Franchino existed until my 10,953th time this past Sunday. The restaurant is a bit hidden and easy to miss. There's no giant sign in front of their restaurant like Calzone's and there's no restaurant hosts gawking at pedestrians to come inside. Franchino is a little secret in Little Italy, like that there are no advertisements for it...I don't want to ruin anything for you Yelpers but if you want a true Italian culinary experience, you have got to come inside Franchino and experience it yourself. This is the place to be if you want to be treated like family!

Love this place, love the food, and love the family. Boyfriend loves italian and we really should be more adventurous... but we find ourselves coming back to Franchino over and over again. The restaurant is really small, with just a handful of tables, but we've never waited more than a few minutes outside. The service is so wonderful, and the family who runs this place is beyond sweet. They are half the reason we come back! My go-to is the pappardelle special. The sausage is amazing and I always have leftovers. Boyfriend has ordered so many different things I have a hard time keeping track, but he always loves what he orders. We've tried dessert here and it's good, but we really like taking a short walk to try dessert at other places-- our way of branching out since we keep coming back to Franchino for dinner!

Extraordinary italian homemade food. A local family business where they make you feel like you are part of their family. The best ever eggplant parmigiana, where they slice very thin pieces of eggplant, dip in flour and egg and grill before stacking into the parmigiana. Simply divine, my favorite dish, if I have to pick just one. My husbands fav is a special, pappardelle (wide noodles) with sausage and mushrooms. Other specials are spectacular too, gnocchi stuffed with gorgonzola cheese or porcini mushrooms - both are fantastic. We have been going here for almost 20 years and the quality is still as good as the first time.

The service was terrible!!!!!! Don't make the mistake of going here. The night started off with them giving our table away after we waited for an hour (which was supposed to be less than 30 minutes). The waitress was rude and told us to wait another 30 minutes, after our table was given away. She said one of the men in our group told her to cancel the order, which was false, for he was with us the whole entire time. The people in front of us had the same issue. We also heard many customers complaining that the food was cold! Please reconsider if you are thinking of going here for food!!!!!

This restaurant is so good! Me and 3 others went for dinner on a Sunday and I was so impressed. It's a bit small and in the heart of little Italy. We were seated right away and given water (after requested of course). This restaurant is family run and the daughter of the owner was the one who took our order. I ordered the pasta pescatore and it was so good! The seafood tasted fresh and the pasta was al dente. The servings were also huge so I was able to take some home. I definitely recommend Franchino. I left feeling 110% satisfied. Word of advice to anyone planning going in a bigger group and need to split the bill, they only accept 2 cards so make sure to bring cash.

Great meal with friends visiting from out of town. Always cautious in this part of town to not totally fall into a tourist trap. I think this place avoids it. Family run, great food, great service.To start we had the prosciutto and melon starter. Totally fresh and good.Mains of a few different kinds of pasta. I think at least the gnocchi, if not all of it, is house made? It was excellent. Perfect blend of sauces and seasonings.Cheesecake for dessert. Eep. Not a fan of this. Too fluffy and not enough taste.Charming space, fun experience.

Been here three times now. We are from Southern California an this is our favorite spot when we come up here. The Cippino is amazing and my favorite. But everything here is delicious. If you live in the area or just visiting come for some food and a amazing time with this family owned place.

I love this restaurant to death. My friend and I ended up here after The House told us there was an hour wait. Ain't nobody got time for that! Yelp guided us to better. So far my favorite Italian restaurant, it's too bad I live in LA. We were seated right away. But do beware seats get filled up quickly as well. We got lucky with timing. The interiors super cute, classy but comfortable, with a welcoming feel. Good to come with family or date. They have a wide variety of wines to select from. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan with a side of veggies to go with something on the lighter side. First time I've ever ordered eggplant Parmesan anywhere but it was delicious. It's not like a thick slab of eggplant with cheese but it seemed more like very thin multiple layers condensed together. And the cheese was perfectly melted nicely balanced ratio. My actual favorite part were the grilled veggies. They were cooked and seasoned to perfection. Not burnt or soggy or dry or bland or salty. Just perfect. The service was awesome. Servers came by to assist with recommendations and fill our water cups frequently. Making sure everything was good. Definitely will be coming back my next sf visit.

Updated** I love that this restaurant is a mom & pop's style family restaurant & the family is hustling and bustling making sure everyone is taken care of. Food is SO GOOD! This is my 2nd time coming here and I ordered the vegetarian Lasagna (big serving!) I appreciate that this place is nestled between chain restaurants and has been open 27 years - what a testament to the food and owners!

We found Franchino on Yelp and we're SO glad we chose this place!! My husband, 3 kids (15,13,10) and myself all had a fabulous dinner!! Awesome Bruschetta and Caprese. My husband and I both ordered the special, Pappardelle with sausage, mushrooms, and more with a touch of Gorgonzola.... Oh. My. Gosh. If we ever get back to San Francisco this will be our first stop!! Not only was the food wonderful but the service and ambiance was excellent as well! Thanks for a great evening!!

The food at franchinos was really good. Me and my baby cakes started with the bruschetta which was really tasty. She ordered gnocchi with two different sauces. One was gorgonzola which I was like aww yeah. The other was their traditional sauce. The waitress didn't recommend to mix the sauces but obviously she didn't know who she was dealing with.We mixed those two sauces like some rebels and the outcome was phenomenal.I had the bistecca which was really flavorful and juicy. I was already sort of full after the appetizer plus sharing my boos food along with my own so I didn't get to finish it but it was succulent. The wine we paired with the meal was exquisite except for the fee for them to open the bottle. Like Ummm I have hands y I has pay you?

The most amazing, freshest pasta you will ever eat! This is a hidden gem in North Beach!! We go anytime we are down there. Family owned and ran, nothing is better than this place.

The food is so good here that my nonna would probably slap me across the face for praising it more than her own. Every time I come to SF I have to plan to eat here at last once. The exterior is not flashy so it is incredibly easy to pass by this place without giving it a second thought. Don't be one of those fools.You really can't go wrong here. The last time I was here for my birthday I got and my boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo. He said it was the best pasta he'd ever had. My mother, who lived in Italy for a few years, also boasts that this pasta is some of the best she's ever had. Definitely the best in America. The only thing I thought was kinda meh was their caprese. Don't get me wrong it was good, but I've had better at mediocre Italian joints.

A truly euphoric dining experience. The most authentic Italian dinning experience I've had on the west coast. The Spaghetti Con Calimari was a perfect balance of briney Calimari, peppery red sauce and expertly cooked pasta. My wife enjoyed the Capellini Mare e Monti which was a flawless execution of land meets sea with a delicate aurora sauce. Dinning here was thehighlight of my SF trip. A MUST for anyone visiting!
