Had this place for dinner and I must say I was quite impressed! They brought out slices of their fresh made sourdough bread (AMAZING) and some butter to start, then had our main dishes out within minutes. The food was incredible! I had the Dungeness Crab Mac and Cheese which was phenomenal. There was A TON of crab meat in the pasta. It's a little expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for. I'm not much of a wine person but someone in our group said that the Pinot Grigio paired well with their seafood pasta. I had a Moscow Mule which was delicious as well. All in all I'd highly recommend this restaurant!

I've always loved Boudin's when I went to the mall, so I was pretty excited to get the chance to eat at this fancy one with the Boudin Museum.We went upstairs to this bistro and on your way up, you can see the bread factory... pretty cool. I ordered a classic Clam Chowder bread bowl, with a Pinot Grigio. My mom decided to try the Grilled Cuban sandwich. The clam chowder bread bowl tasted like any other Boudin clam chowder I ever had, which isn't a bad thing. I mean, that is what they are famous for right? No complaints. My mom's Grilled Cuban sandwich tasted great too. The plantains is what really made them stand out - there were some in the sandwich and even some plantain "fries" came with it too - yum!I liked this experience because I was able to enjoy my favorite shopping mall food in the original city that it's from and also, in a nice, 2 story, clean restaurant with a street view; there are a lot of windows.But at the same time, nothing stood out to me. Like I said above, it tasted how it normally tastes and being in a bigger restaurant can only excite me so much.Good tourist attraction when in the Fisherman's wharf though.

Boudin has a cafe downstairs but also a restaurant upstairs. It seemed easier to go upstairs than traverse the long line downstairs but I suppose there was a reason. The bistro was rather empty for a Saturday lunch and we were seated right away. It was my first time having Boudin's so we got some recommended things.+BREAD & BUTTER: (complimentary) This was probably my favorite part of the meal and would definitely consider buying bread at the bakery downstairs. -CLAM CHOWDER BREAD BOWL: The bread for this was good too! Though there were too many potatoes for my taste. The few pieces of clam we had was good. Also a little on the blander side so we salted this. Maybe I was expecting a lot since I've heard so much about the Boudin bread bowls. -CRAB MAC & CHEESE: I was really excited for this dish but it turned out very bland, though it had a good amount of crab. We added a lot of salt, and the bites with salt and crab were quite good.For the price that we paid, I felt like the food was too mediocre, and I didn't appreciate having to salt my food so much. Eating upstairs also meant that there was an option of a free tour, which we didn't get to take part in because it was closed for a private group. I wish they mentioned this or gave us another option, especially since it was open before we started eating. Our waitress also seemed pretty unenthused and we had the feeling that she didn't want to be there, so it didn't make our experience better at all.All in all, I would highly recommend going to the bakery instead if you must have the clam chowder bread bowl at Fisherman's Wharf, but now that I've had it I won't be returning.

I didn't have high expectations for this restaurant since I thought it was more of a tourist attraction type of restaurant rather than good food, but the orders I have placed really tasted good. The restaurant had a lot of people so it's a popular restaurant so we had to wait for our table. Unfortunately, the sourdough bread was a bit hard but I enjoyed the other dishes. We had the crab and shrimp pizza which was delicious. We also had the fish tacos, and the waiter said we could try one of each of what they had, and it was all so good. My mom and I were stuffed after the meal, and I think it was a decent price for the good food. For those who have time, visit the bakery factory, restaurant, bakery, and museum. This is a must visit building for tourists in San Francisco.

If you ask Californians what to give your out of state friends and families, I'm sure the majority of them would say Sourdough bread and Napa wine. And if you have out of state guests checking out what San Francisco is all about, Boudin should be on the list no questions about it.I don't care if you don't like sourdough bread, you just have to try it. Boudin SF to me is a breath of fresh air. I think most establishments in this area are overpriced. Here you can have a decent bite to it for less than $10 if you like. Look at the menu if you don't believe me. Where would you get that in a tourist trap area? A nice looking building from the outside and an artistic real bread decorations inside.There are two floors to choose from. If you want faster and cheaper options get in line downstairs. It can be challenging to find seats sometimes especially for a large group. But if you want a more expensive option ( still cheap for me considering the location) go upstairs. You can have wine, and a better view. The bathrooms are located on the same floor.Then after you devour all of it. Go to the bread making tour. I think they charge $3 now. We didn't get charged because we went in late closed to midnight. The only downside was that they didn't have anybody explaining anything. No presentation of any kind if you come late. There's still a basket of cut up bread if you like. The food is good for the price. Don't expect a lot of clam chowder. It was filling nevertheless. The sourdough bread tasted fresh. And thanks to the local ingredient called Lactobacillus SF. The strain only thrives in SF. The quote that can be attributed to Mark Twain that goes like this; "the coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in SF" maybe is the key.So much has been written about the weather in SF that it's fascinating to know it's the key ingredient in the tangy sourdough bread of Boudin.Try it with an open mind if you haven't. You'll be glad you did.

Ok so we usually love this place ! We came here again today and the food was great as always! We got oysters , crab cocktail, crab cakes, tacos, burger , and kids meals. Oysters this time were not good! I kept biting into pieces of shells on every oyster and they were giant which isn't a good thing in the oyster world. That's not my main issue tho. They employees are extremely grumpy and not one of them had a smile. Especially the hostesses! They just stand there and give you dirty looks as you wait for your table. Then they sat us and still had an attitude and didn't say one word to us. All the waiters were just walking around looking like they hate their lives! Very different experience from every time we come here. We spent over $400 here this time so it's a big let down we had such bad costumer service.

Can't give this place anything higher than 3 stars. To begin with, the staff weren't that friendly. We waited up at checkin for 5 mins and the lady on the phone didn't even acknowledge us. When we ordered our food it came out on a plate that wasn't that clean. And to top it all off, the sourdough bread bowl with clam chowder was mediocre at best.

My friends and I walked in on a Monday for lunch and decided to dine-in. When we walked to the top floor, the whole place was empty except for 2 tables by the window and they told us we were on a 2 hour wait if we wanted a table with a view. We didn't need a view and they said there was an hour wait on the regular tables. We ended up sitting by the bar, which I honestly had no problem with but even as we were leaving, only an additional 2 or 3 more tables were occupied. Where were all the people with reservations??Food:Clam Chowder Bread Bowl ($16) the soup and bread were good, though it got a bit overwhelming with the creaminess towards the end. If you think you can finish the bowl, think again. After finishing the soup, there's literally no room to fit in an entire sourdough bread. Also, if clams aren't your cup of tea, you can also choose to get lobster bisque.Tuna Tartare ($12) This was actually nice and refreshing dish. The tuna tartare was topped with small chunks of mango and drizzled with reduced balsamic. Then you get thin slices of crispy green papaya chips which is a nice contrast in texture with the tuna.

In spite of myself, I visited here because of my devotion to sourdough bread. As a former California Adventure passholder, I say it is okay to skip Boudin and Ghiradelli as you can find their famous Clam Chowder Bread Bowls and Sundaes back in SoCal anyway. Had I known then what I know now, I would have opted for other explorations of SF, but I digress. There was about a half hour wait to eat at the Bistro so my partner and I visited the bread museum just steps away from the hostess podium. You get free admission if you plan on dining at the restaurant, otherwise it is $3. The museum also has an unsupervised basket of sourdough slices for you to sample while perusing the exhibit. (I say unsupervised because I definitely took around 5 slices of bread and without being scolded, to my pleasure.)When we were seated, it took a few minutes for our waiter to get to us, and while he was efficient and quick, he wasn't particularly warm and inviting. There was a free basket of sourdough slices for the table, which I devoured, even after my initial slices from the museum. We of course ordered the Clam Chowder Bread Bowl while I ordered their Margherita Sourdough Pizza. Clam Chowder Bread Bowl was tasty, as expected, though the bread is not fresh as it is when ordering from California Adventure in Anaheim. The pizza was okay; I expected a more distinct sourdough taste from the dough, but it didn't show up for me. I wish I had ordered fish instead.The verdict is, I am glad I came just to say I did. I think I would have been content with a $3 visit to the museum and quasi-limited samples of sourdough slices.

Boudin is a well-known SF institution and many tourists make it a point to stop for the famous sourdough bread and clam chowder. I always tell folks to go to the Bistro restaurant that's upstairs rather than the downstairs cafeteria-style counter. You get the same food, with more options, plus the benefit of sitting down at a table in a quieter and nicer ambiance where you can take a moment to rest your feet and enjoy the view of the pier from the second story windows. Many times the downstairs counter and tables are busy and full, making it difficult to enjoy the food. I find the experience at the Bistro much more enjoyable and it's always a nice respite. I've always found the food and service to be consistently good. I totally recommend the classic sourdough bread bowls -- both the clam chowder and the lobster bisque are good. We also really like the warm crab dip which is always packed with large pieces of fresh crab -- super cheesy and delicious.

Long lines...you stand in line to order your food. It's quick but waiting to get your names called takes a bit longer. I ordered the clam chowder and the pepperoni pizza. Did take out so they give the bread separate. Took it home to heat and dipped the bread. My kids also loved the soup. I really loved it too. It was fishy and just perfectly seasoned. I could make t my meal next time. Worth the wait. Place was so busy I didn't get to look at the shop but seem to have interesting stuff. The breads are made into animal shapes so we looked at that for a bit. Check this place out and try out the soup.

No waiting for a great view at lunch at Fishermans' Wharf. That's right.. This place is elegant, upscale, comfortable, with wonderful wait service and delicious food. We had lunch here earlier in the month. The elegant dining room made the meal special, as did the wait service--our server was very attentive but did not rush us. I had many questions about the meal options, and he answered all questions to my satisfaction. The food I selected--taco trio (sourdough tortillas-wow..so delicious--with a variety of seafood fillers), salad and calamari appetizer were all perfectly cooked and delicious. My husband doesn't enjoy seafood, but there were plenty of options for him.The prices here are definitely higher than you'd pay downstairs, but for a special meal and a chance to get away from the bustle downstairs and in the city, this bistro serves as a nice respite.

If you love sourdough bread and are visiting SF, this is a good spot to add to your list. Is it a bit of a tourist trap? Yes. Can you enjoy a great bread bowl and view of the bay? Absolutely. A San Francisco establishment since 1849, Boudin makes delicious sourdough daily and you can watch them knead it and bake it into loaves and fun animal creations. Downstairs is their bakery and cafe, but head upstairs to avoid the chaos and enjoy better views. It's a little pricer, but you have a larger menu including oysters and calamari. The clam chowder bread bowl is a classic, but I also enjoy the crab and corn bisque bowl. You can order a nice bottle of white wine for the table as well. I often bring friends visiting here and it's in Fisherman's wharf, so it's a convenient restaurant for lunch if you're already exploring the area.

No waiting at the bistro when you go to the top of the stairs. Nice view and beautiful restaurant. The sour dough bread slices they give you are delicious. Just wish the butter was a little softer. I had the sour dough flour tortilla fish tacos. It was a tad small for the price tag of $17. But it was fairly delicious. It had only a small amount of cod. You could also choose from two other types of tacos. I wished the salsa for topping it had a little more spice to it. My lunch guest, she got the crab Louie salad and enjoyed it. Beautiful presentation. $26I almost wished I just ate downstairs and had soup and a bread bowl. It was a chilly day. Service was excellent.

A second amazing experience that was even better than our first trip here. My wife and I shared a dungeoness crab and shrimp pizza that was to die for and a dungeoness crab and artichoke dip appetizer that was amazing as well. We had a front row seat that was unusual, but fun at the pizza bar. The talented pizza chef was showing us his flair for twirling pizza dough. It was not cheap, but was a great time right here on the waterfront. Service was good but unremarkable. I would of course recommend this place to anyone who wants a quality meal in a great location.

So this is the fancy restaurant upstairs version of the boudin cafe. I kinda wish we woulda saved our money and just eaten in the cafe. Our waiter was super nice but seemed like he was super busy and would ask a question we would get 2 words into our answer and he would be off. We each had a bread bowl and we shared the Crab Louie salad which was delicious and the tacos which were ok. And when you tout a sourdough taco shell I expect a more sourdough flavor. All around an ok experience.

Minus one star because the service was terrible. We waited forever to order and get our check once we were done eating. However the food was good! Not exactly the best food I've ever had, but it wasn't terrible. We ordered the calamari, shrimp and crab pizza, clam chowder, and the spinach and crab dip. The dip was delicious, I totally recommend it. The pizza was a bit soggy on the bottom, but they put plenty of crab and shrimp so you're getting your money's worth.

As far as tourist traps go, this place probably takes the cake at Fishermans Wharf. From weird overpriced gift items downstairs to the overpriced menus upstairs, don't go in here if you're eating/buying on a budget. Our bill was over $50 and we got a bowl of soup and three spicy shrimp tacos. The only reason this was a three star review instead of a two star was because the bread really is all the rage. The hype is real when it comes to the baked goods, especially the sour dough.

Exceptional, white glove-like service from the second you walk up the stairs. Impeccable service from the bartender, who ended up doubling as our server. A hearty sourdough basket started us off right. Excellent kids options, delicious seafood staples (crab cake sandwich was on point) and stiff cocktails made it all worthwhile. Pro tip: If the wait is ridiculously long, scope out a table at the bar and get served from the same menu. Ok, it's touristy, but when in SF, why the hell deny yourself a guilty pleasure?

My boyfriend and I went here on Saturday evening. We called and made our reservation around 3 hours before and got the exact time we wanted, which was nice.Our food was great, as always. I had angel hair pasta with no shrimp and my boyfriend got steak. The pasta was perfect, and the steak was great (but too small).One star is docked because our waitress, I think her name was Julie, was not good. She seemed tired and/or unhappy the entire time. She came to our table to take our order, never asked how things were going, never refilled our water or bread, and didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. When we were done eating, she literally just dropped the check off and picked it up (no words were said.)But this didn't ruin our meal. We still had a great time with a great view of the wharf!! We'll be back.

Our absolute favorite part and why we would come back was actually the bartender! We both work in the industry so it's always cool to meet someone who does the same. I forget his name but he's tall, has dark long curly hair and wears glasses. HE IS HILARIOUS! Definitely a highlight of our trip. Will definitely be back for that pizza and hopefully he will be working again as well. Thank you!

We were passing by the restaurant and noticed tons of people dining with the famous bread bowls in front of them and so we decided to fall for the tourist trap like everyone else. Instead of sitting on the first floor, we decide to go to the second floor and got a great view of Alcatraz. Our server wasn't rude, but wasn't friendly either. He didn't give any recommendations on any food items so I jumped on Yelp to look at pics and see what people here are raving about. Hubby and I decided on the Squash Bisque and Crab Sandwich. The food was great and the bill came to $42 - pricey yes, but I guess I expected that price at a place like this.

Well....i looked at the menu and no chili bread bowl asked the waitress they jus dont carry it the chef doesnt want it on the menu. Heres what i want to know you have a Boudin buliding with bakery n cafe and upstair is the restaurant. But no chili i just would like to ask the 1 owner of this establishment WHY??? What if there was others that didnt want to eat the clam chowder or corn bisque. On top of i would rather eat down stairs than upstairs jus because of this... and downstairs is way cheaper than upstairs by far. So whoever you are (owner) please fix this.

I was less impressed by the bistro than the one on pier 39. The clam chowder was over hyped and left wanting for a thicker, more creamy, smooth flavor! We had a mai Thai that was a true mai Thai with a great flavor! Our waiter was sub par.. he was trying too hard to be a happy good waiter but you could see right through his facade and just didn't present hisself well. He acted like he really would rather be anywhere else.

Service was terrible. Our waitress never refilled our drinks. We were never asked to see a dessert menu and were a party of 7 and we ordered two desserts for all of us to try. However, she only brought two spoons even though we said we would share. When we asked for more spoons she took too long to bring them. She was not attentive at all. I ordered the crab bisque and I was very underwhelmed. It didn't have any crab in it, super salty, and was only vegetables. Price to ratio was not worth it.

We had our wedding lunch reception in Bistro Boudin's museum bakery room and let me tell you: it's one lunch I will never forget (aside from it being our wedding day and all). The views of the Bay were breathtaking and the food...sublime, fresh and tasty. Our guests were completely in awe of everything and they honestly couldn't stop talking about it months after. Elisabeth and Lauren were a joy to work with throughout the planning process! We had a destination wedding so we were going on a whim when choosing our meal spots. I found Bistro Boudin through here and decided the menu and ambiance had exactly what we were looking for. They were incredibly organized, knowledgeable and prompt. I'm not much of a planner but they put my mind at ease on everything. We even had a few vegetarians and guests with extreme seafood/shellfish allergies and they tailored the menu to make sure they were taken care of!Back to the food *trying not to drool over my keyboard*: we gave our guests the choice between...Appetizer: Clam Chowder Sourdough Bread Bowl or Classic Caesar SaladMain: Old-Fashioned Cioppino, Roasted Mahogany Chicken or Grilled Vegetable HarvestDessert: Sourdough Bread Pudding and Valrhona Chocolate CakeEverything was fantastic! If you are from out of town and want to host a lunch or dinner reception, I can't recommend Bistro Boudin enough. They were part of making our day special and memorable.

Our first experience of the famous chowder in a sour dough bowl. While we were a bit nervous about being in the heart of the tourist district we took the advice of other reviewers and had dinner here.Had to wait at the bar for a table and the off-hand staff here was the only negative of an otherwise great experience. Once at our table, the service was excellent as was the chowder and bisque and complimentary sour dough to start. View of the Bay and Alcatraz makes this a fabulous dinner location.

I can see why people give this place good reviews but I can't say that I feel the same way. We stopped by Fisherman's Wharf to explore the area and came across Boudin. Prices were very high. Waiter was attentive, which was nice. Food was decent but I don't know if it's worth the money. It's an upscale restaurant tucked away among lower price establishments. Depending on the type of dining experience you are looking for, this could be a very nice place to eat. For me, it was more of a one time thing.If you do come, I recommend the fish and chips.

We went twice during our recent visit. First visit: We stopped in just for dessert and some apps. Service was great and quick. Second visit: We were seated but we're not given a child's menu for our 4 year old. I asked for one and the server brought a dessert menu. Honest mistake. I asked for the menu again and he went to grab one. When he returned he seemed flustered but took our order. I asked for water twice and never received it. He never came during our meal to check on us. He was not very attentive and it was disappointing. The complimentary bread was delicious, not a fan of their chowder (I know, I know!) my husband ordered the beef stew and that was killer! I ordered the lava cake and that was delicious. Unfortunately the poor service is what kept it from getting a full five stars. Hopefully that server was just on an off day but we would be back.

Very disappointed! We ate at the bistro upstairs expecting a really nice meal. Our waitress recommended the sole fish with mashed potatoes and spinach. It was the most flavorless dish I've ever eaten. Others at my table were disappointed also. On top of that, the waitress didn't check on us, didn't bring water until she gave us the bill. Bad service, bad food, bad attitude. Maybe we should have stayed downstairs in the cafe and gotten the famous chowder instead!

I will be super nice right now while writing this and give them a two rating. I started off with soup. The soup was warm, not hot, no chunks only cream (maybe I just got unlucky) and when I asked for Tabasco I had to walk all the way to the bar and get my own because my server disappeared :/ I was completely turned off from this place. Also I had a server who seemed unhappy.

Fresh seafood check, day drinking check, view of Alcatraz check! Although similar yet more expensive than the other restaurants/stands nearby, being able to enjoy a delicious and relaxing meal indoors with a great view is worth the price, not just cause it's a well-known tourist spot.

Food was just okay. Prices were pretty high and the greeters were full of themselves. We had reservations and didn't get a table until 10 minutes after our reservation, arriving 5 minutes before our reservation time.Service was fast, and the food came out faster than I thought reasonable, making me think a lot of things were pre-prepared and sitting on a line.I was impressed with the bakery downstairs so it was disappointing to find this upstairs.

This review is actually for the deli side... I had the half grilled cheese, and bowl of tomato soup. I have to say the tomato was thick enough to have some depth, and it had fresh chunks of tomato in it ( love that part, we aren't kids anymore) it is also served with amazing croutons that maintain their crispy nature for a surprisingly long time. The grilled cheese is served on sourdough bread (huge slice cut in half) which was toasted to perfection on both sides no less ( I've found it's actually hard to find an establishment that can do this). Although there is no "table service" there is a bus person to clean the tables, and will often take your tray for you. There are several tables to sit at... My self shared a table with an older couple, who turned out to be great company. They have a great assortment of salads, sandwiches, and soups if you're just trying to catch a quick bite to get back out to the tour activities ( or if you have to go back to work).

Having been to Boudin a number of times already, I've reviewed the downstairs bakery, but didn't realize until recently that the upstairs restaurant is listed separately.I've dined at the Bistro a few times already, most recently with some family tourists. But I suppose everyone still kind of feels like a tourist when stepping into Boudin, which is fine because it's always worth a visit. Once you secure a table with the host/ess, your pager gets you into the museum for free.The restaurant features a variety of seafood dishes, salads, meat items, and their famous bread bowls. The complimentary sourdough made in-house is always a nice introduction. I had the Linguini Pasta Primavera, which was good.The bar has a limited draught beer selection, but a list of bottles are available. I don't remember seeing a separate bar menu, so I assume everything on the main menu is available to order.Service is okay (it will always be busy), prices are expected given the area. The location is so convenient, with windows from the dining room that overlook Fisherman's Wharf. If you're spending a little more time at Boudin and want to sit down for a full meal, the Bistro will suit your needs.

We had the cod fish and chips. The fish was very good. The ambiance was great. Very nice inside. Service was also very good. The bread was amazing. Price was a bit high, but you are at Fisherman's Wharf in San Fran at a very pretty restaurant.

Bistro Boudin is a super-overpriced tourist trap in the Fisherman's Wharf area. For $16.95 I got a Chicken Caesar Salad which was a handful of chopped Romaine lettuce with about half of a cold chicken breast cut into strips along with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese flakes that were so tiny they could barely be detected. Despite the fact that one of the renowned Boudin bakeries was right downstairs the sourdough bread they served us was cold and borderline stale so the pieces were dry and difficult to pull apart and tough to chew. I suppose the only redeeming factor here is I got to see the worst San Francisco has to offer its visitors and everything else looked like up from there.

I love sourdough bread and Boudin's is great. We stopped here for a late lunch after taking a boat tour on the wharf. I had the crab cake sandwich, which was pretty good. Others in my group had the clam chowder or the crab and corn bisque and both were well liked. However, there was a long wait to get our food and since there weren't too many other people there at that hour, I was surprised.The bread museum is complimentary if you eat in the upstairs dining room (otherwise $3 per person). You can watch the process they use to bake their bread and read a little about their history. It was interesting and worth the detour.

Service is horrible, took awhile to get seats even though we have reservations. Asked for ketchup and my drink for the pass 10 min and I get an ok, at the end of the meal still no ketchup nor my drink. Ask for the bill that took another 20 min when the tables is pretty empty.

We got to the restaurant and were told that we would have to wait 30 minutes to be seated, but what's really cool is that they offer museum tours for those that are waiting to be seated. Either way, we got seated in about five minutes which was very convenient.When we got to our table, our waiter was really busy with all the tables around him, so he took about 5 minutes to come around to ask for drinks (the waiter was really apologetic about it and really kind as well) but it actually gave us enough time to pick out our appetizers and entrees.The food was VERY good, everyone in our group of friends loved what they had. I had the Crab Macaroni and Cheese and the flavor combination of everything was perfect. There is a restaurant policy that the checks can be split more than 4 ways and being a group of 5, two of us were just going to put our meals on one tab but our waiter was super helpful and was able to split it 5 ways for us anyways, saying he's done it before for even bigger groups but he's gotten reprimanded for it by management, which I think is very incorrect, so thanks to Gerry for being awesome about that! He even threw in free drinks for our group for making us wait those 5 minutes at the beginning.Overall, the experience was fantastic and I am absolutely going to make sure to bring back more of my friends and family because of the amazing service we had and especially because of the high quality food!

First off I hate writing bad reviewsSo if I ever write one, it's because it was really really bad. This restaurant and food itself is not bad, but having HORRIBLE service can ruin your whole experience. This was my first time coming here and i was initially excited until our table was waiting 30 something minutes without any type of acknowledgement.Our waiter didn't ask to take our orders and we literally had to flag him down for water TWICE. When we saw that he was free he went to take other peoples orders and cleaned up other tables as if we weren't there. I swear I'm not a snob or anything. But if were gonna pay 20 dollars a plate I Better get SOME service. After being ignored so long we went to complain and had to switch waiters. When our food came out, It was okay. We had two clam chowder bowls, a cheese plate, and a burger. First off the clam chowder bowls are not worth 15 bucks. The consistency was super watery. The cheese plate was 22 dollars. When it came out, I felt like this was something they would feed a miniature village..Maybe if our waiter wasn't so crappy our we would've been more tolerant. Also they gave us a "sorry his service sucked" baguette. Thanks but our food didn't Taste any better. SERIOUSLY no hate, but the truth.

Pricey but worth it. We had an awesome view and amazing food. Ugh drooling as I write thisWe had the ceviche trio. Fish is a little difficult for me coming out of veganism but I was assured it was really good. The shrimp/mango/avocado one was AMAZING!!!French onion soup a little too cheesy but standard and good. Crab mac n cheese - S O G O O D G E T T H I STotal before tip: $66.changeSo yea $78 for two people without drinks is a little steep but if you're on holiday do it but get the classic clam chowder in a bread bowl. Service is great too which is always a plus. They probably have a good manager or maybe it's the SF air

Bistro Boudin is not a place to be missed by the ordinary tourist in San Francisco, being the original place and all. The area is pretty noticeable and lies in Fisherman's Wharf. The Bistro is a combination of a shop and restaurant, selling sourdough bread and it's ingredients as well is other stuff. Upon arriving my group ordered the signature clam chowder in a sour bread bowl, which was delivered in a mere handful of seconds.The famous clam chowder in a sour bread bowl did not fail to deliver! The clam chowder had the perfect amount of soup and clam, and the bread was just sour enough to be remarkably delicious. One major complaint however is that the water was $3 (I was here in August so this is not definite), which was highly expensive. TL;DR:Pros:-Got food amazingly fast-Outdoor seating-Simply the best sourdough bread and clam chowder-Combo of restaurant and shopCons: -Expensive drinksFinal Verdict: FOUR STARS

Clam chowder bread bowl is awesome. The upstairs restaurant is incredible, very nice ambience and staff. Bar is gorgeous. I come here often and only wish they were open later.

I frequent boudin pretty often because their happy hour is one of the best in the city. Their oysters are top notch and the raw bar specialist, Darius, makes the entire experience 5 star quality. Come and see him for great service and hospitality, he always greets me when I arrive making me feel right at home!

Wow, there is this huge restaurant and downstairs there is a bakery and take out meals. Downstairs they have a dessert waffle that's not on the menu upstairs. One of our 7 really wanted that dessert waffle. No where is posted that you can't bring food from the take out upstairs. I waited in the long line while the rest of the party was waiting for our table. I got upstairs and was rudely informed by John that the food from downstairs couldn't be brought upstairs. Really, they aren't making enough money off all the tourists with their over priced menu items that you can't bring a dessert upstairs. Grab food downstairs and find a table somewhere else.

After a long weekend with childhood friends, we decided to end our night in Fisherman's Wharf. While walking through, we stopped in to see how bread was made at Boudin and ended up eating at the Bistro on the second floor. I really like the fact that you can come and check out the museum while you wait for your table. You really learn some interesting things about this place. Once our buzzer went off, we were walked to our table. The place is nice, low lit lighting, cool ceiling fixtures and big table tops. Our server, although very nice, was a bit clumsy. He wasn't very efficient throughout service and double charged my credit card because of a math mistake. For dinner, I started with the crab cake appetizer for $16.95. Let me tell you, so worth the high price! This is hands down the best crab cake I've had to date. Lots of crab meat and not a lot of filler, served with a roasted corn salad and whole grain mustard aioli. ON POINT! My meal was the Anchor Steam shrimp and chips for $24.95. The shrimp had an Anchor Steam beer batter, served with cole slaw and homemade tartar sauce over thin cut fries. The batter was a little too dense in my opinion and made the overall dish seem stale and not as crispy as I would have preferred. Also, the fries were just blah, nothing really set them apart. I wished everything else was like my experience with the crab cake but overall, I had a good time. This iconic SF landmark is definitely worth visiting again when family/friends come to visit. Come check them out!

Bistro Boudin is located in the uber-touristy area of Fisherman's Warf, inside the giant Boudin bakery/store/museme/restaurant right next to the iconic warf sign. If you are strong willed enough to make it past the fresh sour dough bread and goodies in the store, and then again past the cafe (the bread smell is strong in this place), up the stairs is Bistro Boudin- and you will be rewarded for not filling up before. The views are great from here- you can see across the bay to Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the sun sets are beautiful! On top of that, the food is fantastic and the service is decent. You'll be served all the sour dough delciousness that you want at the table (free bread and butter), and almost all of their entrees involve sour dough in some delectable form or fashion. For me, my choice is always the Dungeness Crab Mac and Cheese. I mean, Ahhh Mahh Gahhh I've had dreams about this dish it's so good. It's also a huge portion, so if you're not too keen on the price (it is a $$ restaurant) you could easily split this dish with a friend and both be full.Service has been decent the few times I've been, nothing spectacular but there are long stretches of time when you're waiting for your drink to be refilled, or more bread to arrive. Be prepared to flag down your waiter/waitress if necessary. I always make this my first dinner when visiting SF, and can't wait to come back and have the amazing mac and cheese! Until then, i'll enjoy it in my dreams....
