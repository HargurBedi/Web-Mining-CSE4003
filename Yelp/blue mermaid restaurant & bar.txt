I was more disappointed in this place then less. It wasn't spectacular and their menu was highly priced. The clam chowder was yummy but I've had better. I was excited to try their crab cakes but they were pushing $38 so I skipped. It's fun for the atmosphere and if I did come back it would be for cocktails and appetizers. Not my favorite by far.

Extremely disappointed in this restaurant within a 5* Hotel.2 out of 4 mornings the restaurant was out of common breakfast items.Food overall is good but service is terrible. First my underage niece was told to leave the restaurant because she brought an ice cream in where the staff said she had to go because it's the law. You can't bring in food items from outside. Next, we figured it was just bad service one off incident, but when eventually we were allowed to enter and order our food it took over an hour to get our food and it wasn't even busy. While my husband ordered clams they gave him a full sized fork rather than a clam fork, which was very surprising as this is supposed to be a seafood restaurant and any server should know a full sized fork does not fit into a clam.Anyone is way better off going outside the hotel to fisherman's Wharf rather than eating at this place.

I consider this to be a nice little gem in the super touristy haven that is Fisherman's Wharf. It's nice because it's near all the sights of the Wharf, but it's a little off the beaten path and doesn't have the inauthentic touristy vibes that many places on the main drag reek of. I've never had the clam chowder, but the crab and corn chowder is DELICIOUS. It's the reason why I've never tried the clam chowder... I know it's good and see no reason to divert from it. I'd recommend getting it in a bread bowl, of course. Additionally, the cocktails are great. I've always encountered super personable bartenders who can make great cocktails and great conversation, and they've got a nice bourbon selection. Thumbs up!

I was expecting way more.Everything was mediocre. I came in craving clam chowder. I ordered a.m bread bowl of New England clam chowder and there was hardly any clams and it tasted like pickles. There was so many chopped up pickles in it.The waitress only checked on us once so we waited longer than I liked for the bill. There was hardly anyone there so I felt like she just didn't really care to serve us. Not coming bk. There are way better places to eat in Fishermans wharf.

I had a really lovely dinner here out on the patio while traveling for business!I was sight-seeing on Fisherman's Wharf, as I suppose most patrons are, and wanted seafood sans kitsch. Blue Mermaid delivered that. They aren't right on the water (in fact, they're tucked away at the end of the street), but that didn't mean I couldn't sit outside and enjoy the weather. My server was attentive, but not overbearing (which is nice, since I was eating alone.) I had a nice glass of wine, some delicious oysters, and an amazing chowder in a sourdough bread bowl for what I thought was a reasonable price. You're in a touristy area and it isn't as though this is a no-frills spot. I would happily be back, if I return to the Bay Area.

My girlfriend and I were looking for a nice place to sit outside for a quick snack and we stumbled upon the Blue Mermaid. It was Sunday afternoon and there was a decent amount of people on the patio. The host provided a warm welcome and quickly walked us to a table on the patio. Our server was just as friendly and welcoming. My girlfriend ordered a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and I added a beef slider to go with my bowl. The slider was an excellent combo with the chowder. She liked the proportionate amount of clams and potatoes in the bowl. We were both grateful for the kind and speedy service that our server provided us with on that day. 5 stars for both the service and the food. We'll definitely be back for more.

Visiting SF and randomly chose this place for dinner. My server was very friendly (and offered advice on a few things I asked about in terms of SF neighborhoods and such) and he was very attentive. Food was good and I noticed that all of their draft beers seemed to be made in CA! This is also a restaurant that participates in the Healthy SF program (which I had to Google) so there was a small tax on my bill but I don't mind. Everyone deserves healthcare and the service industry rarely offers positions with benefits. So, major kudos to CA (and Blue Mermaid) for that one.

Ate here three days while staying at the attached Argonaut Hotel. Good food as far as hotel restaurants go and seemed to have locals eating as well as hotel guests. Highly recommend the Mexican omelette. The chorizo, pepper, onion filling was the best part of it and made the dish as good as it was. It was so good I ordered it all three morning in a row.Average service, nothing special but nothing bad about it either. Hotel guests can also charge the bills to their room. Seemed like they had decent dinner specials as well each night, but only dined for breakfast myself.

We came here for lunch yesterday when my sister and her friends were visiting. We sat outside on their patio and it was wonderful. They have fire pits and with nice weather, it's a great scene. However, I did take note that we were seated with no cutlery or napkins. When they took our drink orders and I requested them, they were not brought for at least 15 minutes. Beyond that the rest of the service was fine. Everyone enjoyed their food. I got the chicken sandwich and garlic fries. Chicken was a little dry but fries were good once a little salt was added. Overall, it was okay. Not sure if I'd go back since, it is at fisherman's wharf and there are a ton more overpriced OK restaurants.

The food was good, but it wasn't spectacular or anything. We had the seafood tower which is the Saturday special. The food was super fresh, but it was all very basic. We ordered the crab dip as an appetizer, and it was a bit heavy on the celery. I couldn't see the outside seating area, but the inside wasn't too crowded. The waitress tried to be attentive, but she was just too busy for the most part of our visit. I understand that a price tag comes with seafood, especially on the wharf... but I just don't think it was worth the money. The tower, the app, and 2 drinks cost us around a hundred dollars. I feel like they just need to add a bit of pizzazz to their food and maybe overall presentation. There's def room for growth here. Also, one waitress claimed the "new" recipe they use for the crab dip is spicy?? It's for sure not. It's a bit dull honestly.

Went gear for early dinner. Was looking forward to sitting down having a great appetizer and some clam chowder in a bread bowl. The restaurant didn't have any appetizers. The chowder came to the table barely warm and tasting like it came from a can. Kinda disappointing for San Francisco. My daughters friend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which looked amazing and was good. The waitress was awesome and nice. She exchanged the clam chowder for their lobster corn chowder which was hot and not too bad in tasting. If it hadn't been for the waitress the experience would haven been way worse.

Took my family here last year for a lunch on Fisherman's Wharf, honestly didn't expect much, but I definitely left very satisfied. My niece and nephew never had a bread bowl with clam chowder and they were amazed. Overall great experience, from delicious food and drinks, to friendly staff. We sat outside on the patio which made it even better in a sunny San Francisco day.

Vesta and I used to go to Houlihan's for popcorn shrimp every time we went to the Wharf. The atmosphere is nice, the servers friendly and it was like a tradition with us.However, since coming back to America after a decade on the sea, Vesta and I decided to try the Blue Mermaid, cuz a guy at the In and Out said their popcorn shrimp was to die for and sailors and ex sailors alike just got a thing for mermaids. So a good recommendation combined with a place called the Blue Mermaid, we had to go.And it's good that we did. We spent quite a bit of time there. The popcorn shrimp really was to die for and we had wine too. Then some more wine, then we decided to stay for dinner and we had fish and chips.And remember, I told you we lived on the ocean for ten years? We've had fish and chips in a lotta places, including all over England and the last time I had fish and chips this good, that Vesta didn't make, was in a place on the wharf in Auckland that served 'em in newspaper.So, will we go back to the Blue Mermaid? You bet your bottom dollar, your top one too.And yes, it is a bit pricy. But, you know, you don't gotta stay and eat if you don't like the prices. I would never, never ever, downgrade a restaurant's rating, just cuz it was expensive. However, as far this place is concerned, the fare was worth every cent.

This was our second time coming here after participating in the Special Olympics 5k Dash and Polar Plunge. It was quite chilly today so we were looking forward to some clam chowder.I like the location, it's not in a sketchy area and its amongst other restaurants that seem pretty busy as well. All of the clam chowders have pork in them except for the Manhattan, which is what I ordered and it contains mostly red bell peppers, shrimp,clams, and other veggies. Some chowders could actually be made gluten free as well for those on certain diets. My family and I also ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was very good! The marinara sauce was surprisingly spicy which we enjoyed. My brother's Caesar salad was way too fishy in my opinion... But we enjoy this place and will probably be back next year after we take the Plunge! ;)

We came here for lunch on a Saturday and sat out on the patio for an early lunch. The weather was nice and the patio is well heated.I had the grilled ahi tuna BLT. The tuna was of good quality and just nicely seared on the outside and good and raw on the inside with good ratios of lettuce and bacon. I will say that the tomato was a bit meager for me. The sandwich was reasonably priced considering the proximity to Fisherman's Wharf.Service was friendly and attentive.

This is a fun place to sit on a patio and relax with a cup of clam chowder and an adult beverage. The daytime menu is pretty limited so be warned. It fits in with my San Francisco tourist strategy which is: walk around and look at things; eat and drink somewhere that has its own restroom. The clam chowder is a good enough reason to stop in even if it's not your primary destination.

Everywhere for breakfast had a line around the corner...started walking towards the wharf and stopped here for corned beef hash and Bellinis... Had a gorgeous breakfast by the fire pit and didn't have to wait or sit elbow to elbow. Didn't get to try their crab corn chowder...maybe next time. The corned beef hash was spectacular and the eggs were perfect! Service was ok... Had to ask for water 3 times and my friend's omelet was lacking in cheese but otherwise this was a great alternative for a hungry group and the ambiance was great. Perfect location to eat before walking the wharf/pier.

Stayed at the hotel attached to this restaurant and had breakfast here. The food was ok. My husband had the eggs Benedict that he enjoyed I had the steel cut oats and a side of bacon. Bacon was pretty undercooked. I ordered a Bloody Mary (that is listed on the menu) and our server told m my hey didn't have the stuff to make it. As the meal went on we realized he didn't really feel like working that day. When we asked for ketchup he nearly slammed on the table as he walked by. This is really a take it or leave it place. With all the other great places within walking distance I will be leaving it from now on.

My husband and I had dinner here. At first glance, the prices seemed high. The music was very loud and the selection wasn't very diverse. He ordered the fish n chips...$19. Not worth the price. Thee tiny pieces of fish and under seasoned garlic fries. I had the chowder trio. Although the New England was nothing like a traditional New England chowder...too watery and not enough clams. The California chowder was my favorite and the corn and crab was second.I would only come back for the chowder.

What can I say about the Blue Mermaid. The location is amazing. The hostess was extremely kind and became instant friends with my wife because of there shared red hair. The waiter was persistent but not overly persistent. The atmosphere was amazing with the outside seating and small fires warming everyone all over the patio. The food: I ate the fish and chips and it was perfect, so was the cup of clam chowder I started with. My wife had cod and polenta for a starter. The polenta was so good she couldn't finish her cod, though she said the cod was as good as the polenta. I highly recommend the blue mermaid. For a causal dinner or romantic night out.

I went to Blue Mermaid for the first time and I'd say it's a fancy place. There are beautiful candles on the tables, a clean bar, seatings are nice, etc. I love that I could come here without feeling overdressed when I want to dress nicely. The chowder was the bomb but it filled me up so quickly. I think the menus should be updated; they should add non-alcoholic drinks so customers don't think alcohol is the only thing they serve.

Went to this place during my recent trip to SF. I heard so many great things about it being one of the best for its chowders. Let me tell you, was not disappointed at all. I either have good luck in having people recommending good places to eat or I have good taste. Its located near Fishermans Wharf so its a great place to eat when you're a tourist because its next to many things to see. We went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded and we got in right before they closed for dinner. The staff was very attentive and friendly as well sine they knew we were tourists.We went solely for the purpose of the legendary chowders. We tried the sampler trio and each one was delicious that we ended up ordering a bowl of the Manhattan clam. They do provide fresh bread to accompany your soup which was a nice bonus. Overall satisfied.If you're ever in this area, it is a must go to!

Would leave zero stars if possible. Actually can't comment on the food or drink as we could not get served. Walked in a about noon on Saturday the 17th and sat at the bar with a friend. A woman walked behind the bar, would not make eye contact and made herself tea as she chatted with what appeared to be a bus boy at the end of the bar. She walked past us at least three times. Another gentlemen came up, walked behind the bar, grabbed something and left. After 15 minutes of no eye contact, no words, no acknowledgement we left. Very disappointed!!!!

My friend and I were making our way to the other end of Fisherman's Wharf and to Pier 39 when we spotted the restaurant sign for Blue Mermaid and the words "chowder" in the headline. It was a sight for weary travelers like us! We were by the bay, so a nautical themed, and mermaid loving place that beckoned us for some warm chowder really appealed to us.We ordered our meal, and it was served to us within minutes. I ordered mine in a bread bowl, and it was probably the best dish I had all day. There were morsels of crab in every bite, some sausage, corn, and other creamy soupy goodness in every spoonful.I will definitely be back, and this is a new SF fave for me.

As soon as we sat down we ordered popcorn shrimp bread and a drink. I think that's the only reason we received our food at all. It was completely empty when we first arrived and gradually filled to 3/4. Our waiter was very polite and nice, but goodness gracious he was horrible at providing service. I asked for a straw and waited so long I got up and found someone with one. Ok fine no ones perfect. He didn't refill our drinks at all! My husband got up and found someone to give us water. When he finally came back I asked for a dessert menu that never came. I just got up for the third time to find someone to give us the check. The shrimp was really good but we definitely won't be coming back.

Their selection of chowders was worth the tripto touristy Fisherman's Wharf.Mind you,I did have to brave a bevy of peoplewho, for whatever reason, do not knowor are unaware of what the purposeof a crosswalk is.Then,there was the parking.Well, I actually lucked on parkingso no complaints there.In fact, no more complaints.Blue Mermaid is a warm and cozy spot in the Argonaut hotel(by the way, I heart Kimpton hotels)and the food they servesis super fitting of their location near the Wharf.Their seafood is fine,but again, their chowdah is the real treat.They have a varietyI have never heard of before,and they also offera chowdah sampler.It wasgood.Oh, their blondie for dessertcomes a close second.So be sure it's someone'sbirthday *wink, wink* to get this amazingcomplimentary dessertand make sure to tipa little extra for them being so nice!

Seems weird to some that I prefer corn chowder over clam chowder, but I just do.It wouldn't be the first time that I went against popular foods here in SF.Came in with my buddy who just got married to try their chowder and some shrimp cocktail and some crab salad.All were good. I really thought the corn chowder here was a standout, hence the 4 stars.Enough spice, not too watery, not too creamy, enough corn and smokey bacon. Great!

Really liked this place! The bartender was really nice and we actually made it for happy hour, which I would come back for if I'm ever in the area.I did the sampler (12$) with New England chowder (wanted to play it safe with at least one), mussel and sausage (a little too tomatoe-y for me), and the shrimp and red pepper (really liked it!! The red pepper is just bell pepper, so it wasn't spicy, which was a relief for me. Lol).I also tried the splash bros (came in a martini glass, PRETTY strong, but still had a nice taste to it. Definitely did it's job. Lol) & the primms cup (came in a mason jar with a handle, super cute! It was really good, maybe because I was already kind of tipsy from the first one. But if you want your money's worth, both were happy hour & were 6$, ask for light ice). Oh, btw, you have to sit at the bar in order to get happy hour (we went on Monday where it's 3 to close).Nice inside & it wasn't too crowded or loud, which I liked, but maybe that's because it was a Monday.

Use to always come here for special occasions during high school. Very pricey place though. Fortunately, I never had to pay . Love their calamari!

Stopped in for lunch after reading that the crab and corn chowder was delicious....and it sure was. Probably the best lunch I have had in a long time- I also enjoyed the oysters and a cold brew. I sat on the patio on a beautiful California September day and thoroughly enjoyed my experience.

The service is excruciatingly slow, constantly empty waters, under seasoned cioppino and very expensive at that. Wanted this place to great :/

In the mood for clam chowder and was very happy with the California clam chowder. The atmosphere was quite pleasant with the rustic brick building and lots of birds chirping, but no birds on the patio.

Very nice atmosphere on the patio. We stopped here for brunch and enjoyed both the ruben and their American breakfast. Wait staff were friendly and helpful.
