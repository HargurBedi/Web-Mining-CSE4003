I had dinner here with a small group; the location was chosen out of convenience, as a friend had warned that the food isn't very good. But it seemed like an easy place to meet up and the menu struck me as tantalizing. Unfortunately, what should have been tasty was mediocre and greasy (although not atrocious). Macaroni and cheese was swimming in grease and lacking in any complexity. Other dishes looked to be similarly large and plain - maybe more akin to something found at applebee's. The cookies were enormous, but a fair amount was left on the table, as we just weren't interested.

This place is awesome for many reasons, and not just because it's within walking distance of where we live. It also fits double strollers (a rarity in Hayes Valley, unfortunately). But I've yet to have a bad meal here. Tons of options and very eclectic (which can sometimes be bad), but everything here is genuinely good! From the French toast to the chili, to the humongous ice cream sandwiches made with Three Twins ice cream. The orange juice is prepared fresh and there's a ton of speciality drinks that also tickle my fancy (such as the lavender lemonade). Portions are generous, and won't leave you wanting more.This place is also child-friendly, but also cool to check out with a group of friends wanting a chill place to go for a drink (or a group of parents looking for a place to go with their little ones). Service is pretty awesome as well. Only word of caution: don't bring outside food here, even if you are ordering in. We learned the hard way, although the staff were still awesome and very nice about it. A+ all around for me!

Stopped in for a mid afternoon snack to hold us over until our late dinner. Me and the hubby split a cup of chicken lime tortilla soup. Pastrami sandwich and a slice of pecan pie. It really hit the spot!! The soup was hardy with a nice lime tang. The pastrami was tender with just the right amount of fat. Ummmm! And the pie was a perfect sweet ending. Cool place with a rustic vibe. You order at the counter and they bring it to you.

Love it here. I've been twice to The Grove on Fillmore but this was the first time at the Hayes location and it definitely lived up to its name. I got the breakfast burrito and added chicken apple sausage which was for sure a good choice. It's also HUGE which I love because let's be real, nobody wants to pay $12 for a tiny little burrito.Go...

I feel like they raised their prices. It's gonna be $15 with tax for a dish here. I had the breakfast burrito today and it wasn't that satisfying. Just eggs and beans. They had some tomatoes as garnish..should have been in the burrito. But of course you don't come here for Mexican food do you? I am trying to refrain from using the word "overpriced" in my Yelp entries, but this was "overpriced." That's just the way it is..

Hmmm. A green tea and a slice of rather stale banana bread was $11 at this casual order-at-the-counter cafe. When your tea costs more than your coffee, you're doing something wrong. I took it to the back corner to eat, and noticed a fair amount of food bits on the floor next to me. It was an early Sunday morning and the staff was just standing around - I'm surprised they didn't clean it up. One good reason to keep things tidy is to prevent rodents - a mouse crawled out of the floorboard and helped himself to the leftovers. Shortly thereafter a couple of ladies sat down at the next table. Not wanting to hear a high pitched scream, I warned them of said murid (it's a word, look it up). They quickly moved to the other side of the place. All in all...not a great experience.

Friendly staff! Good food! Love the decor! Can't say anything bad about this place- they serve breakfast all day, fresh squeezed OJ and home made lemonade, salads, beer, a little of everything... my favorites are the eggs Benedict/ chicken pot pie/ French onion soup! Come check it in Hayes Valley!

This place is nice and super busy. I have eaten here few times when it's little bit less busy than yesterday. I recently cut off all the dairy products from my diet. When I ordered the salad as you can see in an image I attached it looks super fresh and delicious however what sort of disappointing was that dressing at the button under all the veggies. It wasn't a really good surprise for me to dig in and find it there. I honestly need to remember that restaurants do put dressing on the salads. I prefer lemon vinegar and I am good to go. I am absolutely do love the watermelon cooler. I would ask for less ice bc it does melt into it quick and kills the flavor. I would also make sure you are reading your receipts bc I was charged twice for my salad and not even hummus which was what I ordered originally.

Great hangout!I am mad, so mad! I used to work in the Hayes Valley area for years and all that time there was parking lot where The Grove now stands! I move on and got a job on another corner of the town and boom! Pops out another branch of The Grove right where the parking lot used to be! How frustrating!! But, fortunately even in those parking lot days, I did often visit The Grove's other locations and must say that I always enjoyed the food, the coffee and the setup. All locations offer a comfortable hangout for 2 or more people, or for a single person who wants to eat, drink and read a book.Today I tried something new of their menu. I had a pastrami sandwich which reminded me of my New York City days when I traveled all the way across town to stop at Carnegie Deli just to have a pastrami sandwich, sometimes with a matzo ball soup. Well Carnegie Deli is now gone, but I am happy to report that the pastrami sandwich at The Grove is pretty good too. It even comes with a big pickled cucumber!!By the way, if I am not mistaken, they now have three locations in San Francisco. So check them out before a parking lot pops up in their place!!

Postmate review!I was craving some salads and it was raining outside so decided to Postmate and give The Grove a try. I ordered the Nicose Salad and some side apple sausages. When it came, it was nicely presented so that's a good sign. It had good amounts of tuna, kind of dry though. Dressing was a nice vinegar touch. Sausages were decent, not bad, it's like the ones you buy at Costco.I wanted to try this place for brunch, but of course after NYE, all the hung over drunkies were in line, but will try next time!

The Grove is a walk up & order your food. They serve a wide variety of comfort food. I have eaten her twice one time pretty good. The second time was not so good. The most recent time we had a poorly made Chinese chicken salad. It was bland & lacked dressing & had little chicken in it. We also had a cheesesteak and it was NOT even close to a classic cheesesteak. It was thickly cut beef, non melted cheese on a panini. The previous visit I had a decent tortilla soup & good pastrami sandwich with chips.

Came here on Christmas Eve for brunch. There's a huge selection of food available with breakfast served all day. I ordered the avocado toast side. Unfortunately, there was miscommunication between me and the cashier and I was charged for the egg and avocado toast. When I went back to see why my bill was so high, they fixed it automatically! I also noticed that they do a fantastic job of maintaining the place. Water cups are constantly refilled and plates are taken away in a timely manner. Everyone is super friendly!The avocado toast was good but it wasn't very toasty. You can see the slightly burnt marks and the looks of melted butter on the bread but it certainly didn't take like it. It was too cold and my avocado was already beginning to brown, so that doesn't seem fresh. Also there was chunks of salt that I ate. Granted it wasn't a huge amount but it would have tasted much better if it was sprinkled more evenly. I don't think that was the best and not for $4.50. Based on food I would give it a 2. However, due to the service, I would bump it up to a 3.

Such a terrible experience. After getting caught in the rain I ran into the Grove to grab something to eat with friends. My friends got in line (which was all the way to the door) while I made my way to the bathroom. I was immediately stopped by someone that worked there who asked me what I was doing. I explained that I had to use the bathroom because I couldn't wait with the line being so long. He very rudely informed me that a lot of people do that and I had to wait to use the bathroom until I made a purchase. We ended up going next door and getting Thai food instead. I have eaten here before since I live in the neighborhood. I won't be going back again based on being treated like I was a bathroom thief.

Came here on a late Saturday night. We were hungry quite late and were looking for something casual and cozy. This place, upon entry, was amazing! It felt like you were in a cabin and had a great atmosphere. I loved the various seating arrangements - chairs next to a fire, benches, tables, and booths. It's a nice variety. If you're just ordering dessert and coffee/tea, you can sit near the fireplace and enjoy it. We were hungry, so we ordered food. It all sounded pretty good. We ordered the BLT, taco platter, and the Lime Chicken Tortilla soup. The workers were all super nice and willing to help out, since it was our first time.The food was really disappointing. If it weren't for the great ambiance, I would have given this place 1 star. The food was so bland and gross. It didn't taste like much. It felt like something you would order at a cafeteria or at a hospital. I had two tacos left and chose not to take them home...who throws away tacos?!

I had lunch here last week with my team. Firstly, the line can get pretty long at noon, so I would advise getting there a little before if you don't want to wait.I had the Berkely Bowl Salad $11.75 (with chicken +3$). While it took a while for my order to come out (due to how busy they were), it was satisfying and tasty. Fortunately for me, this lunch was on my boss's tab. While I enjoyed my meal, I would not have liked it as much had I just spent over 15$ on it. The manager also came out to our group and personally apologized for how long our table's orders were taking to come out, and brought out some free bread for us to share while we waited.The atmosphere here is cool, and there is also a small outdoor seating area. This would be a nice place for a beer on a sunny afternoon. I would go back for a cocktail, but probably not for the food.

We go to SF Jazz a lot so we wanted to eat dinner close. I found this place by looking on Google maps. I loved the menu and all the pictures that people put up on here (thank you) I had the grilled cheese, salad greens, and the French onion soup. It was good but the soup was a bit salty for me. But still good! My hubby had steak enchiladas. I saw Abel, an employee on Yelp and saw him when we got in line. What a great guy! He told us how he has been there 3 years and loves it. The employees are awesome here! It truly is San Francisco's living room!

This is one of my go-to places when I'm not sure where to go. The menu has a large variety with lots of unique, delicious salads as well as other items. The food is always satisfying and their dessert section will make your mouth drop. As the desserts are jaw droppers, I wouldn't say they are spectacular but will definitely do the trick when you're craving something sweet! I've never had one of their homemade ice cream cookie sandwiches but I will definitely make sure to try that next!

Wow. I have never had this type of service at a restaurant before. We come in after a show at the Davies a symphony Hall. A lot of customers were there after us so it was busy.1st offense: my friend ordered a Salmon eggs Benedict and it never came after 30 minutes when all of our other food from the group had come out already. When we asked about it the hostess/server said she would check on it. Several minutes later she says they are working on it. Then minutes later she returns checking up on us and the food still didn't arrived. She tells my friend "you won't be paying for it". The hostess then returns with a receipt of the voided transaction and a complimentary cookie. She apologizes and starts walking away. I ask her if the food will be out any time soon. She replies "they aren't going to be making it, I'm sorry. I wish I could do more". Our entire group looks at her in shock and our jaws drop. How is a restaurant with 800+ reviews able to get away with this? I say to the hostess "I'm sorry, are you saying at this pint now, you made her wait over 50 mins for a "free" cookie? That can't be right." My friend is so upset she starts crying. Then I believe a manager comes by and asks about the status of the salmon eggs Benedict. He goes back to the kitchen and watches the cooks make the dish. 5 minutes later the dish comes out. Wow.2nd offense: I ordered a $10 grilled cheese sandwich, out comes the $5 kids version (white bread weak grill marks not crispy) with no condiments that the dish was supposed to accompany it. (Chips and pickle for adult version or apple slices for kids version) I ask the hostess what version of grilled cheese I got. She says "that's the kid version" I tell her I had the adult version and she tells the cooks to check on it. They then bring out the same sandwich. The hostess tells me "I'm sorry, the kitchen told me they ran out of the bread for the adult grilled cheese, so here's another one of the kids version". Again, I am flabbergasted and take the sandwich because I am hungry STILL WITHOUT the chips. Not even apple slices? Ha!Needless to say we will NEVER come back to this place. I understand if a restaurant is.m busy and may take time to get the food out, however if you are gonna stay in business you need to get your orders correct and if mistakes are made please address them in an appropriate manner.Please excuse typos because I am very upset about this experience.

We ordered take out (living 1 block away) - ordered one breakfast burrito and one eggs Benedict and two coffee drinks - total was $40 something and we added a tip as well. They forgot a side and it took asking several people to get the rest of our order. When we finally got home and cut into the $14 eggs benedict, we were disappointed to find the eggs were not poached, but fully cooked like a hard boiled egg. The quality of the food here is definitely not worth the price!

I had a good experience here. I actually came here alone to grab a quick dinner before heading to the airport. Cafes and diners are my favorite types of restaurants so this was great.I had their BLT sandwich with added avocado and a side salad. Sandwich was so good. A little too toasted on the top and bottom which hurt my mouth a bit but I've noticed a lot of cafes in San Francisco make their sandwiches this way.Great atmosphere. Good service. Lots of seating. Much enjoyed!

First time here and I would have to give this place 5 stars. Came here before going to the symphony for a performance. Had order the chicken pot pie and lavender lemonade while my bf order the mac'n'cheese with bacon. Food was pretty good. A little downside of chicken pot pie was it's a little soupy but overall still good. The lavender lemonade was delicious! My brother said the lavender was strong but I don't think it's strong. I would probably come back if I'm in the area to try the other items on the menu.

Nothing to rave home about which is shocking compared to its Fillmore location. I ordered the Guacamole Chop with flank steak... my steak was all fat and pretty much still mooing on my plate... salad was primarily romaine and not even the leafy green pants rt. Nice people at the front, easy to get a spot, spacious but food wasn't anything to rave home about. Would Recommend the Mac and cheese though.

The Grove is a great option when you are not sure what you are in the mood for or it is an odd time of day to eat. I live really close to the Grove and while I usually never set out to come here specifically, I find myself here quite often.Their breakfast is, IMHO, their best menu. I have had many of their scrambles and sandwiches and they are all really good. My boyfriend loves their Bread Pudding with Fresh Strawberries. They have solid coffee and are generally really quick with getting the food out.Lunch and Dinner are also okay, my main complaint is the portion size. More specifically, I think they are somewhat expensive for the amount of food you get. The Grove isn't expensive at all, but I do question the value. The food is tasty, though, and it is possible to get a good meal for $20, but you should order sides if you're hungry. My favorite dish: the Berkeley Bowl salad. So good and so light.The Grove also has really good dessert. Their Carrot Cake is something I dream of. I haven't had a chance to try their pies yet, but I am always tempted from how they look.The other nice thing about The Grove is that they are open late (11 on weeknights, 12 on weekends) so it is a good place if you need some late night grub. The food will not leave you feeling bloated.Overall, a fine option if you are in the area or with a lot of people, but maybe not worth seeking out.

I really drank more than I ate here, but overall it was great. I definitely recommend the bloody soju mary--I never would've thought of that combo, but I couldn't taste any alcohol at all! Food was also fairly tasty--you can't go wrong with the salmon platter. I wasn't a huge fan of the cookie though, which was definitely a monster cookie (size of my hand!), but it was thin and much crispier than I imagined, rather than soft and chewy. Atmosphere is absolutely amazing though, and comfortable enough for me and my friends to hang out and have great conversations in. This is definitely a nice meet up spot if that's what you are after.

I like that they are dog friendly so my group of 4 were able to grab some food while sitting outside people watching -- that's always fun in SF.

Food:Always fresh, tasty, and made well. I've come here a few times now and haven't been disappointed. This time I ordered the apple chicken salad and beef tacos. The salad's cheese was too strong for my liking, but overall it was a good salad. The tacos were well made and the meat was seasoned well. (7.6/10)Ambience:This joint's got a cool feel to it. Kinda urban mixed with cozy. The one thing that can be a hassle is the seating. Since it's not too big of a spot, I wouldn't recommend a large group.

I am a fan! I came here today for a business lunch. It was tasty. I first was struck by how homey it feels upon entering. The woman handing out the menus was friendly and welcoming. You grab a menu and order at the counter here. I ordered a BLT. They have thick cut bacon. Holy yum. The bread was perfectly grilled panini style. Everything was fresh. I have to shout out the two bus guys as well they were funny and attentive. He made some funny jokes and I made some right back. Next time I am out in SF in this neighborhood I will definitely come back to try out some other items. They have some massive looking cookies and serve breakfast all day. This place is a winner!

Pretty good food but nothing to rave about. I came here for very late lunch on a Sunday (~3 pm) and it was pretty much empty. This was a good thing though because it meant we found the table we wanted immediately and were served our food pretty quickly.I ordered the mac and cheese which came with a small side salad. I actually really liked the salad. All it had was mixed greens but the greens tasted fresh and the dressing was mixed well. It was also perfect to cut the grease of the mac and cheese. Don't get me wrong - I loved the cheesiness of the mac and cheese and enjoyed the flavor but you could literally see the grease pooling at the bottom of the serving dish. So as much as I liked the mac and cheese I had to stop eating it after I ran out of salad. I liked the food and it was definitely a filling meal for $13, but if I were to come back I would probably try a lighter breakfast option.

Not my fave Grove.They don't have paninis:, like the one in the Marina used to have:/, and the Berkeley bowl was a little stingy on the goodness (only a few garbanzo beans).The red velvet cake tasted kinda old, like it's been sitting there for a minute. Disappointing end to this meal. I wanted climactic, memorable, epic even. Denied.On the plus side, they have wine and yummy coffee libations. Convenient location.Elevate your game, Grove.

We have here an order at the counter cafe, complete with colorful chalkboard menus above the register, or extensive laminated menus behind you, as an employee pointed out. Check out the baked goods! Once you order, bring your number to the table of your choice while waiting for food to arrive. They'll bring over utensils as well. Self serve water to the left behind you after ordering, next to napkins, sugar, straws, etc. Highlights:My sis got the standard smoked salmon eggs Benedict with a very fluffy English muffin and a side of delicious rectangular hash browns, sliced & crumbled in center, a gentle disarray of perfectly crisp edges, yet soft in the middle. I would get a side order with my meal if there's a next time!Crispy bacon and chilled rotisserie chicken for the Cobb salad, included green goddess dressing was sour. They didn't have ranch. Two slices of grilled bread adorned my salad, soft in the center!Chicken salad sandwich tasted homemade, kind of like comfort food for me, plus had the same kind of bread as my salad. Impressive presentation. Warm homey feel, lots of wooden structure, and decorated with wreaths and lots of red bows for the holidays.Friendly staff with genuine smiles, always a plus! Even with my questions about food, particularly the Cobb salad's contents. They clear up plates when you're finished. Some seats are lounge chairs with low side tables while others are wooden bench/chair combos. Quick turnover, especially with couples just stopping by for brunch cocktails and bites. Definitely family friendly for breakfast all day and lunch/light dinner. As soon as we stood up to leave around 1pm, some folks already claimed our tables.

It was my first time at the grove. I ordered a chicken pot pie which is $15 and is listed as an entree. The server brings it out on a plate and it looks to be sizable as the crust has inflated into a dome covering what I assumed to be a full chicken pot pie. I popped the crust and discover a tiny bowl of chicken pot pie beneath. Using the word bowl here is generous. I was more of a side dish you would keep peanuts in at a cocktail party. Sure the crust tastes good and so does the meager pie but now I'm still walking around Hayes St hungry as hell having paid $15 for what can only be considered a side or an appetizer. Sorely disappointed with the portion.

No wait for a decent brunch on a Saturday. That alone is worth 3 stars in SF. I had the avocado toast and it was delicious-- I would definitely come back and order it again. Mimosas were made with freshly squeezed orange juice-- yum! But pricey. The service was great, the decor was pretty terrible. We brought friends here and the decor really made us think twice about eating there. It has a cheesy Texas meets Disney meets Hard Rock decor. Why?!I'd recommend if you don't want to wait for brunch and you're not bringing SF visitors with you.

EPIC breakfast menu--and a pretty decent price point for a good amount of food. Two things took off a star:1. SO CROWDED. I know that's a good thing for them, but a line looping around the inside of the building made it a little awkward to sit and eat.2. Not very comfortable. Ok, this place is really hip, but the seating (while it looks cool) is not very butt-friendly--but maybe that's the point so get you out since they're so crowded?

Cute and cozy cafe with mediocre food and service.Me and my friend were both seriously surprised at how small the portions were. He got the grilled cheese with side of soup for about $10 and it was seriously smaller than a kids meal. My french onion soup wasn't ridiculously small, but it is still overpriced when you realize that Absinthe across the street charges $3 less and that is a more upscale restaurant.Also, the $3 side of ham is the equivalent size to one small piece of bacon. When I asked the server, she noted that this was alot smaller than usual and brought me out some more, but I'm still shocked that they would even send something out like that.Bussers were slow to clear off tables and staff didn't seem to be working well together. After our food came, we asked if our drinks were coming. We were told they were at the counter, but why did it take 10-15 min for them to let us know?3 stars because food was decent and came out quick.

Stop! Please, let me help you! This place is overwhelmingly mediocre. Please, do not subject yourself to this "food." The Grove is one of those enigmas, where I cannot imagine how they stay in business in a city like San Francisco, where there is so much choice of food that doesn't suck. Are ALL the customers first-time customers? Or have I been systematically ordering the worst items on the menu every time?I have eaten here 4 times. Each time I've given them the benefit of the doubt ("oh, maybe they were just having an off day"), because I really wanted to like the place. But it has never gotten better, and each time I left feeling cheated out of my money.The [few] positive things first: their drip coffee is okay-ish, and some of their other beverage options have been fine.Now, the bad. Here are some of the dishes they have ruined:- Spinach, fontina, and tomato egg scramble:Easy, simple dish. They somehow messed it up. The eggs were burnt! Singed to dark brown. The spinach tasted like it came from a can. The tomatoes were in the low quality "Taco Bell produce" tier -- basically white, with a slight pinkish tint. Everything about the dish was bad; low quality produce and impressively bad execution.- French toast. You should not be able to ruin french toast! They attempt to prepare it authentic style, with French bread. (Exciting, I love authentic french toast!) When I ordered it, they must have accidentally let the bread go stale for 2 weeks instead of 2 days. It was hard as a rock, literally inedible. It was a stone. I could not cut it or bite it at all, exerting my full strength with my fork/knife, or with my teeth. I sent it back (I never send things back, but it was not even food at this point), and the second attempt was predictably equally inedible. I left having eaten nothing.- Egg and avocado toast:Admittedly less abysmal than the others. The avocado was fine. The bread was this squishy nonsense that would be at home coming from the bargain bin shelf at the grocery store, nearby the wonder bread. Avocado toast needs only two things: excellent avocados, and excellent bread. If you can't do that, you shouldn't have it on the menu. But it was at least edible.- Fresh fruit platter:Predictably, all the fruit was not-so-fresh. The berries and melons were all essentially flavorless. The strawberries still had most of their greens attached, removed haphazardly, with bits of the greens stuck to the side of many of the berries. Lots of other berries had bits of dirt on them. And nearly all of the strawberries had the thing where they're white all along the tops, and only the bottom of the berries had any color. Obviously, they tasted bad. Again, if your fruit quality sucks, don't offer a fruit plate.In fairness, I will mention that my friend got the chicken pot pie, and said it was fine (not great, but not awful). He hated the rest of his food, however, and agreed that he wouldn't bother returning.I wanted to love this place. The decor/atmosphere is decent. The all-day breakfast menu is alluring. There are several locations around the city. So convenient! Sadly, the food has been beyond abysmal each time I've stopped by.Don't let the misleading Yelp scores (3.5 at the time of this posting-- wtf?) fool you as they did with me. This place is not worth the sadness calories.TL;DR: Overpriced, very mediocre food. Terrible quality produce. Astonishingly bad food preparation/cooking. Sort of okay atmosphere. Their menu is expansive and over-ambitous, and they fail to execute even the simplest items, like egg scrambles or french toast. Maybe an okay place to quickly grab a coffee and web surf, but not a place to get real food.

I really enjoy the grove. It's a cute place that is very instagramable. They have some good grub, are great for brunch and breakfast foods. If you are in Hayes valley I would definitely stop by and get some eggs Benedict, or a club sandwich. You won't be let down. The portions aren't huge, but it doesn't matter, because they make up for it with the quality.

Stopped in for a quick bite after the Giants game. Had the French onion soup and she had the bread pudding. Both very good.The grove is a great local spot everyone should check out. There's no wifi but it's a good place for a meal with friends.

I'm really surprised by the low reviews for this restaurant. I work right by Hayes Valley and The Grove is one of my favorite dining choices in the area. First off, the rustic wooden decor gives off an airy, comfy living room ambience feel, which is very fitting for the hipster heavy culture in this neighborhood. There are lots of tables for two and larger communal tables. Plus there's super cute outdoor seating available. They've certainly stepped up their customer service -- a greeter welcomes you and hands you a menu at the door, the cashiers are knowledge and bubbly, and the servers are efficient and friendly. The food is colorful, flavorful, and delicious! Their menu options are awesome here -- filled with a variety to tickle anyone's pickle. I personally love the salads. I used to get the Tuna Salad, which is not on the menu anymore. I also love the Steak Salad which is HUGE and truly what a steak salad should be... Generous portions of juicy flank steak strips over fresh mixed greens, red tomatoes, potatoes, and blue cheese. Loves it!This is a lunch worthy place for sure -- prices aren't bad either. You definitely get a good bang for your buck here! Cookies are ginormous as well, and that ways gets an extra star in my book! ;)

I liked it, but definitely didn't love it. It's ok for a quick dinner before catching an event at the Nourse Theater, but I wouldn't go there otherwise.I think the chicken pot pie is their best dish, so worth trying it out. They have good selection of beer on tap, and a few wines, but I couldn't find any cocktails.

A pretty nice environment, but I wasn't there long so I'll keep this brief. I got the cubano. The side salad was a good side. Simple, not demanding attention. The Cubano.... The pork was SO DRY. It made me sad. The ham was super thin and the cheese was decent. The mustard worked well with the cheese and ham, but the pork was the main part and it was flavorless and dry.... The bread was buttered and grilled, but honestly it was too tough as it scraped up the roof of my mouth.The workers are nice and friendly. I could probably hang out there, but the Cubano was quite disappointing. I'm sure the other items they have are better. But this sandwich gets a 2....

I went here the other night for a quick dinner with 2 friends- we waited in line for about 30min, and our food came in 10min. It was obvious that they were very understaffed that night, and for such a busy night they maintained exceptional customer service AND the food + pie was delicious. I recommend the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with bleu cheese. However, their entire menu is perfect!

Hummus- taste was strong and complimented well with breadMy group of friends enjoyed their food as well. The steak burrito was great they said as well as the eggs Benedict . See you again SF. Back to LA FOR NOW :)

Love the Grove! It's an easy spot to meet friends since 1) you pay at the counter, avoiding the split-the-check ordeal and 2) the menu is super lengthy, but everything is delicious! It does get quite crowded but I've always been able to locate an empty table.I've tried several breakfast offerings and salads and I think the Cobb salad, Asian salad, and granola with fruit & yogurt are reliable go-tos. They also have a ton of drinks and desserts to choose from -- the giant cookies are so yummy! I do kind of wish they had options with smaller serving sizes though, I end up leaving pretty stuffed more often than not.

The eggs Benedict with Salmon or Dave's way is absolutely delicious. You will not be disappointed because the hollandaise sauce is made with love. Pair that with a Mamosa for $8 more and you got yourself a brunch deal!

Despite the long lines, this isn't an oasis.Yes, it's run by San Franciscans, but so are many other restaurants.Should I give you guys brownie points for my lackluster panini and salty onion dip?Heck, I'm a San Franciscan, born and raised in SF, but no one gives me 5 stars.Even after munching on my own food, then pushing it aside because the dip was way too salty and I finished my small panini, I turned to my friend's hotdog when she said she couldn't finish it all.Sure, I'll eat it, I said.Meh, and ho-hum for the hot dog.I literally could have bought the ingredients from Whole Foods and have made this myself.And I'm the worst cook you'll ever meet.3 stars for average food.

This place isn't too expensive but for what you get, I was really disappointed. I got the Chicken Pot Pie. The service here was really good. The host (person by the door) was super nice and friendly. He bumped the review up from a 2 to a 3. The pot pie looked really good, but that's about it. Once you open it, the dough isn't as flaky and cooked as you want it to be. At some parts it's still a bit doughy. The soup itself...was so salty. It was actually really hard to eat because of the salt level. It was so salty, but also had a flavor I couldn't put my finger on. My friend tried it and he nailed it perfectly. "It's so salty, and they tried to hide the salt with pepper." That is basically what happened. It was drowning in pepper and salt. Not a fan. I ate maybe 1/3 of it and gave up because I just couldn't take it anymore. Really unfortunate. The bathrooms are really clean and nice though.

My favorite thing was the cucumber ginger spritzer! I had the grilled cheese with bacon. It was just okay. The salad that came with it was also just okay. I'll try the brunch, but I'd have to say the yelp stars are accurate so far in my experience.

This is a pretty big 'all wood' restaurant in a convenient location of Hayes Valley. It is quite cheap, around 10-12$ for an entree/salad/sandwich of good sizes.The quality is average to good.There was lots of people in line for lunch on a Sunday but there are lots of cashiers so it goes fast. The actual restaurant was packed as well but we managed to find a spot easily, people eat fast there, it seems.I had the Asian Chicken Salad. I couldn't really tell that it was "Asian", besides the roasted peanuts and cilantro, because there was hardly any dressing. I had to ask for more on the side (one of the waitresses forgot when I asked, so I had to go back and ask). There was a good amount of chicken breast, which was good, tender pieces. I think it would have been better hot though as it was served (very) cold. A pretty big bowl with lots of roasted peanuts too, served with two pieces of toasted bread.The salad was ok but I wouldn't crave it and want to go back for it or anything.My husband had a Turkey sandwich and it was ok as well.

Updated review
I'm sorry but the new (manager I assume?) is so rude and unwelcoming and pretty much harassed us until we got sick of her asking us questions (3 times she came to our table asking if we'd be getting anything else or something similar) implying she didn't like us sitting and talking after only having coffees that we left. Unbelievable. As I work nearby I consistently go there and even take to-go orders so I don't feel like it's inappropriate to visit when I want some coffee with a friend as I give them plenty of business regularly. I'm appalled at her behavior from the moment we arrived telling my partner he couldn't take a seat until he placed an order first but he was waiting on me to arrive. It was terrible and If she is the new manager, I won't be going back there again. Sorry but your food is not THAT good and there are plenty of other choices in the area.

I have been to quite a few restaurants and good food is not cheap! But this isn't the case at The Grove everything is under 14$!! And delicious fancy but with a home cooked food with a nice view of the street the music is great and the feel is City social scene with a cozy warmth I had the cheesestake it was delicious super cheesy packed with juicy tender meat and my husband had the meatball sandwich superb the bread toasted and filled with more cheese! And last but not least my daughter had French toast GIANT of French toast! WITH strawberry. Dream come true, affordable Without the sacrifice of quality!!!!

What? How have I not written a review for The Grove Hayes yet? lol. I like this Grove location much better than the one downtown (I've never been to the Fillmore one though). It's close-ish to my boyfriend's apartment, so it's one of my go-to places for brunch on the weekends. This place gets busy, but so far it has never been so busy that I've been unable to find a seat. I particularly like the small outdoor seating areas. It's not much to look at, and it's just composed of some tables and chairs, but I like being outside in general. Easy to get to, a short walk from Market St in the nice Hayes Valley neighbourhood, near other restaurants and stores. Plus, it's close to Smitten if you want an icy dessert after ;) The staff is friendly and service is generally fast. Overall, a really good place to hang out with friends or your significant other.

I really enjoyed my meal here. I got the chicken pot pie with cranberry Apple pie for dessert. The chicken pot pie was amazing! And huuuge. I finished every last piece of it. The crust was buttery and flavorful and the chicken pot pie was seasoned just right; it had a variety of veggies in it and the chicken was incredibly tender. The cranberry apple pie was really yummy, too. It had the right amount of tart and the crust was firm at the bottom and flakey on top; just the way I like it. The atmosphere was really robust and lively. U love that the place is surrounded by Windows, giving the place a ton of natural light. They even have a fireplace inside with a lounge area. It reminded me of a ski resort in Tahoe. Super cozy and inviting! Def coming back.

Charging an extra $2.95 to add Chicken Apple Sausage to a Breakfast Burrito but then having to go on a search and rescue mission to find any of said sausage?C'est un brunch faux pas.That's French for "WHERE'S MY CHICKEN APPLE SAUSAGE AT?"(I know, I'm classy.)

I love this place. The location is good for pre/post symphony/ballet. The ambience is nice and the food is yummy and reasonably priced. But, the best part is Joanne, the hostess. She is so friendly and genuinely interested in how your meal is. She also dug through the garbage to pick out something we accidentally left on a plate. She wouldn't let us do it. And, she did it with a smile and without judgement. We will be back again, and again.

Who knew there would be a ski lodge themed cafe in Hayes Valley that serves, wait for it, ski lodge appropriate food and beverages?When you walk in you immediately become drawn to the couch and fireplace section in the center, then you probably notice the light woods throughout, animal hides and pillows on the benches. Of course much like at a typical ski lodge you walk up to the counter to order your food and from both of my experiences here, service should come with a friendly warm smile. Their fare includes grilled cheese, tomato bisque soup, salads, steel-cut irish oatmeal, house made granola, breakfast platters, and of course fantastic hot chocolate(appropriate for most of the year given SF's finicky weather). There is ample seating situated in a large space so walk on in and kick back from a hard day on the urban slopes of SF.
