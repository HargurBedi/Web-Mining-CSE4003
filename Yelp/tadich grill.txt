Possibly my best dining experiance thus far in San Francisco. Theres a reason this place is the oldest on the west coast and the 5th oldest restaraunt in the country and the amazing food and service. I ordered their famed cioppino seafood soup and several cocktails. It was chock full of shrimp, oysters, scallops, 2 fish fillets, etc and a side of delicious garlic bread as well as the regular fresh baked bread they give with all orders. I expected a soup to be light but I was stuffed and couldnt even finish it. Everything tasted amazing, the white coated service, classy atmosphere, and interesting conversation added to the experiance, and the unique cocktails were strongly mixed and left me feeling good on my bart commute home. Will definitely be back soon.

I like Tadich Grill's old school vibe. It always has a good, family style atmosphere covered with very nice folks; both waiters and customers.We have occasional seafood cravings in my household and Tadich Grill is a great place to satisfy these cravings. I love the menu, dishes are usually simple and the seafood is the star. It might actually be a little bit too simple for some folks but I like the bare bones seafood experience with some fish and steamed/boiled veggies. Rockefeller oysters are amazing. I tried a couple of different things on the menu. I liked the halibut steak and the whole sea bass. It is definitely a $$$ place but the quality of food is upscale.They don't take reservations and wait for a part of two is usually at least 20 mins. You can wait at the bar and get some drinks while waiting for your table.

After a fantastic lunch at Kokkari, we wanted to have some drinks in the area. Our friend, Valerie, suggested Tadich Grill. Just the other day a work colleague asked me about this place. During the many years we lived in the city and the Bay Area, we had never made it there. So I was excited. When we entered, we let the staff know we wanted to sit at the bar and have drinks. We were sent to the back. There were three open seats followed by many bar seats which were labeled closed. Since we weren't eating ( it was mid afternoon) , we were told we could not sit down and were sent back to the front where there were no free seats. Again we asked about drinks and were told that we could get something and stand. We decided to leave and ended up at Harrington's where we spent several hours and quite a lot of money. This place is resting on its laurels.

Came here again with my parents and sister M. again. M. treated us for our bdays. Thanks to her. I was looking for something good that was cheaper--not possible...so I ended up getting the dungeness crabcakes. They were nice and it came with rice and a lot of veggies. Also had some of the creamed spinach good. I wonder though if some of the dishes could be 5-10$ cheaper. Meal is not economical and the interior experience is not that nice. Well, the history is special. And the menu is interesting and the food is dependable. Oh yeah, bread dishes!

Go for the old school ambience- a seafood oriented old school diner, they serve classics and the servers have an old world finesse you see in Europe. They know how to chat. Know how to make suggestions. Check on you perfectly without being intrusive. First of all, I love that the whole bar is first come first serve. This is by definition a tourist definition and I am not beyond doing touristy things. What's annoying about most touristy places is that your overplanning super party tourists try to pillage all the seating so locals and solo diners get screwed. After about a 20-30 minute wait, I snagged myself a seat. I enjoyed it because the process was fair and equitable especially with solo older men who seem like they're from here and just enjoy the food. The self seating process is by far a highlight. The bartender is old school and professional - asked for an old fashioned and asked what whisky I wanted which is most def how every place should do it rather than resorting to rail whisky like most joints these days. I ordered bulleit, and they had it. It was strong and no frills. As for the dinner menu- I say it's pretty solid. Given the choice between a grilled fish dish and the cheesy casserole dish of broiled fish and prawns, the server pointed me to the cheesy dish (forgot what it's called) and I appreciated it. Nomally I don't eat cheese and I don't like gimmicky food which I was afraid this was going to be. But it was absolutely solid. And for about 20 dollars, the portion was generous and delicious. There was almost a New Orleans vibe to the food and service - they just do it right and don't pay attention to trends. Unfortunately I didn't have room for my creamed spinach so I had to ditch it after a few bites, but that was also good. Once again, no frills creamed spinach, steak diner style - just plain good. The decor was kept the same throughout the years and it was absolutely gorgeous. I wouldn't eat here all the time if I lived in the Bay Area (I hate waiting) but definitely worth trying out as a tourist and bringing your out of town friends to experience golden age dining.

A couple of my local friends really like this restaurant and recommended that I check it out. Since I was in town for the SF Marathon, I came here on a late Saturday afternoon. I was dining solo and was able to find a seat at the bar. All of the servers looked very professional as they were all wearing white jackets. I ordered their Seafood Cioppino and the server started me off with some bread and iced tea.*Seafood Cioppino*This was some good stuff! This signature house special included clams, mussels, prawns, scallops, bay shrimp, crab meat, and white fish. It also came with garlic toast. If you like seafood, this would be excellent on a cold day.The service was fantastic. My server was the best and he kept refilling my iced tea without me asking him once. This will now be one of my go-to places whenever I'm in town. I will definitely be back! The only bad thing that I can say about this place is that it is closed on Sundays.

Everything was too salty. I was super eager to try this place because a lot of sources talk about the history of this place. We were quickly seated at the counter tables which were first come first serve on a Tuesday night. More crowded than expected. The wait staff seemed to consist of mostly older gentlemen which felt like it aligned with the overall story of this place. We had a light dinner. The Boston clam chowder was pretty salty and I've had lots of clam chowder before. It was probably bottom 20%. We also got the Tadich Platter and several items there was too salty. Couldn't really finish the platter though it was nice variety. I wouldn't come back here again though because there are a ton of great seafood places in the city. The vibe and atmosphere bumped up this place to 3 stars.

Walking into Tadich Grill, for me, is like slipping on a comfortable robe knowing that I'm going to enjoy every moment!We are talking food here but there isn't quite the right metaphor needed for how I feel about this place.I first encountered Tadich Grill back in my graduate school days. I was asked to go to dinner with some big muckity muck on behalf of the school, with the bill being paid by someone else. I had no idea about this place but I remembered the food was good and comforting.Years and gainful employment later, I find myself returning to Tadich Grill. When it's busy it look reminds of classic San Francisco dining...it should having been around for more than 100 years.The sea food choices are great and their specialties are just fine. While service can be spotty when busy, I've found that when one waiter falls down on the job, another jumps in to take their place. Not a bad thing.Better still I'm surprised by their dessert, with the bread pudding being a personal favorite. And the drink choices are wide and varied with plenty of top-shelf choices to wash everything down. In short, I suspect I'll be back again and again. I took my spouse recently and she loved it...forgot I took her in the past and insists on coming back.Sounds like plan to me!

Fell in love with this place the moment we walked in. The service was exceptional, from the bar to our table. We had the crab cakes & the Cioppino....and it was Perfection! There was so much flavor & plenty of seafood in this dish. The crab cake was my appetizer & the Cioppino was my main course. I was struggling to finish everything because I didn't want to waste one bite of these heavenly dishes. FYI, if you're able..ask to be seated at one of Marion's tables, he was phenomenal & has worked there for over 30yrs!

A classic. An institution. A feel-good place that is the kind of restaurant every major city has...the place where the established, old timers, celebrities, politicians, businesspeople etc. seem to gather for cocktails. The bar at Tadich is at 100-foot long and you can enjoy dinner seated there or you can be seated at a white-tableclothed table for fresh grilled fish, raw bar and steakhouse styled salads and appetizers. The cippolino is fantastic and is in a tangy red broth. the Dungeness crab cakes are over the top delicious. Great for a business lunch or dinner, especially at one of the semi-private booths or just for drinks at the bar. No reservations accepted so you have to wait for a table, and no American Express.

I been wanting to try their seafood cioppino for the longest time. Finally, I had the chance to and was completely disappointed. They are generous with the seafood but the soup base was not for me. It was salty and not flavor profile I was expecting... I did however, enjoyed their garlic bread but that was not the star of the dish. Service was pretty good for lunch hour.

Been coming here I think forever but not as forever for the restaurant as it really has been serving food forever. So last night after stops and starts with a meeting I stopped here. Starting at the bar with the perfect small martini and the banter from the great bartenders that told me to f***k the cancelled meeting and just enjoy the place. Well, since I haven't been here for a few years I certainly made a great choice. So after a couple of those super cocktails I went down the counter for dinner. Now the counter is great and don't forget those great booths in the back that make this place special. So ordering I had the great steams clams, the great bread that is always present and the amazingly fresh fried seafood platter. I mean the food ordered was perfect. The service awesome and the only ding was my mistake ordering the custard rice pudding for dessert that had way too much nutmeg. So, this place remains great and it may be a few years again til I get back but I am sure it will be just as good as ever.

Came here for an early weekday dinner with a coworker. We came because we heard that Tadich Grill is one of those SF institutions and has been around forever.We shared the calamari appetizer and chowder. I had the famous seafood cioppino and he had the lamb. All portions were very, very generous, especially for SF. I don't think any of us finished anything that we ordered. All the seafood was super fresh. I had a ton of different seafood in the cioppino. Side note: I really liked how they had large lemon wedges just sitting out on the table for you. The service was very attentive. We came in around 6:30pm and didn't have to wait. Warning, they will not seat you until your full party is present.

If you know people coming to San Francisco and are asking for recommendations on where to eat....... this is definitely the place! First of all, they have the best seafood cioppino in the city!!! 5 stars just for this dish. It's a huge portion filled with scallops, clams, prawns, bay shrimp, crabmeat, and white fish. The garlic bread that accompanies this dish is great for dipping in the red cioppino sauce. I've also tried the breaded veal cutlet, pasta, and vegetable. This was more than enough food for one person. The breaded veal cutlet was soft and easy to eat. I have also tried a bowl of the Boston clam chowder. I wish it came with oyster crackers on the side but it was very good. The noise level is loud on a weekend night. Sometimes I felt like I was shouting to the person sitting right next to me. I'm not sure how it is on weekday nights. This restaurant is definitely good for groups. There is a big bar area where you can grab some drinks while you're waiting.

Our dinning experience was very enjoyable celebrating my mother in-laws 86th birthday. We walked in and were immediately seated despite the packed-midweek dinner crowd. Quality of the food and service is a testament to the restaurants commitment to SFO's dinners and why they are still around. Waiters and staff were all pro's and really on the ball despite the crowd.I will definitely return to Tadichs whenever I visit SFO. Cant beat consistency, it endures.

I have been dining at Tadich Grill since the mid-eighties. After a move east my dining experience has been sadly limited to one or two annual visits. I like the predictability and the very professional service staff Tadich Grill specializes in. Some newer trendier restaurants could learn a lesson or two. The menu reflects seasonal offerings such as halibut or petrale sole. I had mushroom raviolis in a horseradish cream sauce, which was delightful.

Old school but still very cool. The menu is traditional, with lots of seafood and hearty meal options. I loved the size of the portions and how many fresh vegetables came with each meal! It is pricy, but when you see how much meat or fish you get, it makes sense. While waiting, I sat at the bar and the bartenders were so much fun! They were engaging and happy, talking me into a shirley temple which is random but reminds me of my childhood. Also, space is rather tight! I would love to sit in one of the more private booths.

This place is a classic. Locals still come here despite the presence of clueless tourists wearing their baseball hats inside.Our service was perfect. The waiter provided recommendations and was professional and friendly.The complimentary sourdough bread was delicious. The oysters on the half shell were plump and juicy (although one had a teensy bit of grit).If you don't order the cioppino, you're a fool. Yes, it is crazy expensive like everything else here. But it's wonderful. The crab cakes are terrific, too.This is the third oldest restaurant in the country and the oldest restaurant in California. Long may it live.And remove your stupid baseball hat. You don't need it inside the restaurant.

I really wanted to love this place because of the historical significance of the restaurant and the good reviews. I got the clam chowder, such was excellent, and the crab and lobster thermador. The crab and lobster thermadore had a very strange curry or saffron taste to it? Not sure what it was but I expected a thermador to be the tangy, garlicy, bread crumb, creamy goodness that you attribute to thermadors. I couldn't really get past the first few bites. To their credit, there was a ton of crab and lobster, but the sauce was watery and bland. It just wasn't good, especially for near $40.

We came on a Saturday night around 7pm and was lucky enough to find street parking for free! When we walked in it was super crowded and people were just lining up against the wall to wait for a table. There is open bar seating and it's based on the honor system on who came first. We tried putting our name down and even that was difficult because it was just a crowd of people at the front. No waiters were around to take down names. Thankfully I stood by the wall and there were two seats open at the bar and I was able to get them since no one wanted it near me! We sat down at the bar and our waiter gave us a very detailed old school menu. I ordered the cioppino of course and my partner ordered the crab cakes. The cioppino came piping HOT. Filled with crab, fish, scallops, shrimp, baby shrimp, clams and mussels. Even though it was around $35 for both of the dishes the cioppino was def the better of the two deals. In terms of taste, it was okaaaay. I mean the broth was tasty and it was packed with seafood! But it's one of those where you have for once and I don't think I'll ever crave for it again. Crab cakes were okay as well, nothing to rave about. The sauce on top made the dish really heavy and it came with rice and steamed vegetables. Overall, dishes were decent and I can see why you should come here for the old school vibe. I would recommend coming here at least once to experience a restaurant that's been open since 1849 but the food was decent. Not AMAZING. Tip: look out for open bar seats!

Tadich really has some of the fewest vegetarian options of any restaurant that I've been to in quite a while. I had some oversized French fries, a steamed artichoke, and some bread.Drinks are cheap--$8 for cocktails or so--but are made with not-quite top-shelf ingredients, like no-name bourbon and Cinzano vermouth for my Manhattan. The bartenders are enthusiastic, though.Tablemates enjoyed their seafood-heavy dinner, though, and the cioppino admittedly looked tasty!

Nice front of house service and of course fabulous historic / folklore atmosphere. The food was less than uninspired - bland and composed of clearly very cheap ingredients. The waiter, a white haired gentlemen who looked the part, hurried us along, upselling every one in our party of 6, gave negligent and misleading wine descriptions clearly just trying to sell, and was generally unsatisfactory. What I will remember of this experience is the great old decor and the laughable food sold at an exorbitant premium. And The careless service. Not a bite of food was memorable. If you are seeking a strong whiff of a golden era, and also want to eat well, be treated graciously, and taste quality exciting dishes to boot, make the trip to LA and go to Musso's.

This place had a long wait and even this hangry girl decided to wait it through. I came with a party of 5 on a Saturday night around 6 pm and the wait was around 45 minutes. I heard this is the place to go in SF if you want seafood or meat. After being seated I looked over the menu and decided on the cioppino. When the cioppino came out it was absolutely glorious. It had big chunks of seafood and the cioppino broth was absolutely divine. The portion itself was enormous too that I had leftovers for the next day. I had a bite of the steak which was also perfectly grilled. The food here is amazing and the servers here were good about getting people in and out so no one lingered for too long. I would definitely come back here for seafood and grilled meats.

The original cold day restaurant!You see the above on the front page of the menu, but let me assure you that cold, freezing, warm or hot, one may stop for a meal here and leave fully satisfied! I am not going to beat around the bush, I stop here for the Cioppino! Every single time I tell myself, "try something different", and at times I have, but Cioppino is what I drool for and it is what brings me back! My second favorite is their fried calamari, but the portions are so generous that I can only indulge in this tasty appetizer if I have a hungry friend or two with me! Now let me tell you about the Seafood Cioppino! This is their signature dish. all the goodness comes in a large plate and is based in a delicious tomato based sauce. What is "all the goodness" you may ask? We are talking scallops, clams, shrimps, mussels, white fish, and on and on! Oh that sauce though! Just deep the sourdough bread in it, let it get soaked, put it in your mouth, close your eyes and let your taste buds tell you all about it!Here is a tip, if this is your first time and it is only 2 or maximum 3 of you, sit at the counter and engage your server in a casual conversation. You may learn a thing or two about Tadich Grill's history or even San Francisco and food. Most of the servers have been there for years and can answer many of your questions.At the end, if you have any room left, I recommend the Bourbon Bread Pudding and a cup of coffee (or tea).Oh, and do not forget to read the history of the place on the front page of the menu! It is short and fun to read.

After working nearby for a bit, I decided I needed to stop by sometime. A Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 was perfect for no line. While the whole experience was kind of interesting and something I'm really glad I did (once), the food was just serviceable - it was stunningly bland and plain. I will give it that the bread pudding was pretty good! The old-timey service was kind of fun to experience, along with the old-fashioned silly frills of the oyster plate and our drinks, but I can't see coming back.

A quintessential old school dining experience. Super friendly and exceptional service. Delightful interior and wonderful seafood San Francisco style without pretension. We saw everyone from well dressed diners to tourists get a taste of SF to office workers getting some dinner before heading home. We came early on a Friday evening bracing ourselves for a line. But as it turned out we were ahead of the wave and were seated right away. We had side cars and oyster on half shell appetizer, while we decided what to order for dinner. The waiter brought a quarter round of a great looking bread. I had to resist having any to save room for the main event. We ordered the cioppino and the grilled crab cakes. The cioppino was amazing. The broth tasted of all the fish, shellfish, and tomatoes. All the fish and shellfish were cooked perfectly. It is as if they were still underdone when the dish left the kitchen and cruised to a perfect finish when it arrived. It is a filling dish, so go easy on the bread or you won't be able to finish the yummy cioppino! The grilled crab cakes are also quite delicious. Grilling is a nice change from deep frying. The crab cakes are like two fists on the plate. The side of vegetables were so so and needed to be a little warmer. The bread is really really good. Thick chewy crust and deep wonderful flavor. Just want to say again we had exceptional congenial service from David113.

Quintessential San Francisco. Over 20 plus years I have successfully tried every dish at this amazing neighborhood eatery. The staff is professional, efficient, non-intrusive and even friendly - provided you have thick skin (local inside joke).The feel and vibe here is just something you have to experience. Try the counter for something different. I wish I could give 6 stars for this darling of San Francisco dining.

SF's "original Cold Day restaurant" certainly knows how to warm you up and leave you feeling full! Ever since I set foot in the City for work, Tadich Grill was on my bucket list to try. I'm so glad I finally came in for one of their best-known dishes, the cioppino. One of the first things I noticed about the dish was the sheer amount of portions, which were *cue Trump voice imitation* YUUUUUUUGE! They definitely don't skimp out on clams, shrimp, crab meat, scallops, and the other seafood. Also, the tomato broth is piping hot and very hearty. However, as great as the broth and the seafood are, I really loved the garlic bread that came with the stew. It was perfectly toasted, and although at first it looked to be overly saturated with garlic and olive oil, it tasted just right. Perfect complement to the tomato broth! Compared to the other cioppinos I've had, this one is the best BY FAR. Sure, it's a little expensive (I believe it was $28, excluding tip and tax), but the portions are worth it. You WILL leave full and satisfied! I'm glad I had the opportunity to dine in one of SF's oldest restaurants, even if it was for lunch. I'll be sure to recommend their cioppino to anyone who is in need of something that's NOT ramen to warm them up on a cold day.

This place is great. Common sense and no pretensions.They don't take reservations. I got there at around five, and got a seat at the long bar immediately. But within half an hour there was a huge press of people crammed into the entry waiting for a seat. The restaurant has a no-bullshit policy for seats at the food bar. Three different times during my meal when groups of FiDi types with rolexes and rolled-up shirtsleeves and hair gel tried to sit down and order a drink while waiting for a table, the waiter shooed them away and told them to wait with everyone else. The staff yell up and down the bar and hustle back and forth with plates and refills. Since they're going back and forth down the line it's easy to flag down your waiter as he passes if you need something. At the bar, you sit down, get bread, order fast, get your food fast, eat fast, and get out fast. I don't mean that I felt rushed, but the staff was quick and efficient once I decided what I wanted or when I asked for the check. My waiter was super energetic and friendly, like some kind of fantasy-novel innkeeper, bustling from one task to the next, jolly but busy and short. He'd take down an order with a few scribbles of a pen, say "Done!", snap his pad closed, and hurry on down the line. And lo and behold, a few minutes later he'd reappear and present the person's food with a flourish.My food was great, by the way. But you can get great food in many places in SF. This place has a really unique, fantastic atmosphere.

You got to love the old fashion decor. Cozy private-ish booths. Dark wood all around. A long wooden bar in the front. This is what I would call a traditional restaurant. I been wanting to dine here because of it's history and known as one of the oldest restaurants in all of America. The food was good but yeah nothing like over the top. It's consistent I would assume because it has been opened for over 100 years. The menu is huge, so many things to choose from. My friend and I started with the **Steam Clams. So happy they have clams rather than just mussels. The clams were cooked perfectly and that garlic broth was very tasty. Can dip bread in it all day long. We also got a single order of their **Crab Cake. Yum! Crab in every bite. For entrees, my friend got their **Cioppino. Very tasty. Not the best I had but it was good. I got the special, **Crab and Shrimp Casserole. Loaded with cheese, crab, prawns and rice. So yummy. Heavy tho but so good. We ended the night with their **Bread Pudding. Its made with bourbon and very sweet. It was good but not amazing. The staff was friendly as well as our server. I will definitely come back because it's just a cool atmosphere.

Heard and read about Tadich all over Yelp and knew we had to take a chomp while we were in SF. Yes, the wait was long, but we spent the time having some drinks around the corner. I must say that the wait was worth it. We ordered the filet, Spaghetti, sea bass, and cioppino. The standouts were hands down the sea bass first and the cioppino second. That damn sea bass just melted in my mouth. Pretty awesome. In addition to the food, the service was excellent. Completely game for banter while being a total gentleman. Love this place! While you're there, get the carrot cake too!

Bloody Mary Review - As the oldest bar west of the Mississippi and the third oldest bar in the country, Tadich Grill has its food, drink, service and especially its bloody mary down to perfection. Indulge in big tomato flavor all day, every day. But for that added kick, just ask for it spicy. A dash of hot sauce and a swirl of horseradish make this cocktail complete. Why go? A classic bloody mary done right. | Price: $7.75

A mixed review. Been wanting to go here for a long time. As other Yelpers have indicated, staff seems to be in auto-pilot. Took my 80 yr old mom for lunch today around 2:15. Place was clearing out. We got sat at a two table and it was still a bit noisy. We waited about 10 mins to be acknowledged and offered water or drinks. My mom had previously gotten up and stepped into one of the many booth-like areas and felt the noise level was much less. I told the waiter my mother was having a hard time hearing and asked if we could move into the more private 4 table. He flatly says they are reserved for 3 or more followed by an insincere "sorry". I get it. Keep the 4 tops for groups of 3 or more. I also expect context to govern over rules in well-run businesses. It's a tweener time, plenty of room, and we're looking for an accommodation for hearing/age. We walked past 5 empty 4-tops on our way out...We had the fish and chips. $23. Very good. Good tartar too. Food was a 5. Service was a 1-2. Avg 3. Try it for the food but don't expect a waiter that gives a sh**.

Very disappointing in service and food. Paid a visit while in the city on recommendation from locals. It is apparently an institution but we felt our fish was overlooked, (simple grill and a mixed seafood plate)vegetables from a frozen bag that were cold and flavorless and the service was slow and inattentive. Don't waste your money. There are so many fabulous restaurants in the city.

A staple of the SF culture. Though it is a small space, they seem to make it work. For such a high price, it would be nice to be able to make reservations. That would be my only beef with TG. The calamari was really tasty and the meat ravioli didn't disappoint. The bar tab will curb your drinking. $32 for 4 beers is a bit steep, especially for local beers like Anchor. Just show up early to get on the list. Off hours are probably best if you don't have a lot of time to wait.

I read somewhere that Tadich Grill is believed to be the 3rd oldest restaurant in the USA. The Mr. and I love food in general, and we particularly enjoy eating in historic restaurants with excellent service. Check, check, double check. Tadich Grill ticked all of those boxes. The Mr. had crab cakes and I had the seafood cioppino. I had a taste of his crab cakes and they were very good, but the *star* of that meal was my seafood cioppino. The cioppino was chock full of seafood, in a broth so delicious I could have eaten it alone. The homemade garlic bread that came with my meal, was just perfect for sopping up that amazing broth. It's a good thing they put a bib on me! :) As tasty as it was, I couldn't finish it. I have to admit the Mr. was very glad I left him some, and he gladly polished it off for me. While in San Francisco, the Mr. and I had many great meals, but none better then our dinner at Tadich Grill! #Grin

*** In Short ***Long-standing SF restaurant serving up a variety of classic seafood dishes.*** In Depth ***I LOVE places that specialize in seafood dishes - unfortunately, I've found that SF tends to be a bit lacking in these types of establishments, and the ones I've been to so far have been none too impressive. Tadich Grill is no exception to this, but does a solid job of fulfilling any seafood cravings you may have, with speed (entrees come out impressively quickly), convenience (being centrally located and all), and variety (25 seafood-centric entrees, by my last count).So, if you're looking for something more classic, be it pan-fried, sauteed, fried, or cheesy casserole'd with a generous buttering, give Tadich a shot. If you're looking for something a bit more highbrow (like a pan-fried black cod provencale), well, you tell me when you find a place so I can try it too!***Accessibility Info***Venue - The venue is pretty spacious, though accessibility may be difficult for some, given that the place is always packed and the spacing in between their tables is a bit on the narrow side. The center of the restaurant is taken up by the bar, with your typical bar counter seating.Bathroom - Didn't try them.

I had not been to Tadich Grill in over 30 years. Tickets for 4 to see Wicked in SF and I was tasked with finding the restaurant for our pre show meal. I picked a hands down winner. Our meals were great! Service was spot on, and I picked the perfect place that had something for everyone in our party. Cocktails were expertly prepared. Decent wine list, but being from wine country we brought our own. Reasonable 20 dollar corkage for SF, and they provided great wine service for the fee.Impressive, yet unobtrusive service was a major plus. Historical ambience. 30 years was way too long to stay away! I will not let that happen again!

The cioppino at Tadich is the best I have ever had. The light red broth, succulent white fish, layers of crab, tender tuna steak, and prawns all combine for an incredible flavor I find delicious .The menu is extensive, although I've only tried the also excellent crab cake appetizer. The staff at Tadich may be a bit rough around the the edges for some. I suggest going strictly for the food and the rest will grow on you.

Favorite restaurant in San Francisco! We make a point to eat here every trip. Old style and oldest restaurant in California. No reservations taken so you just check in and Wall hang until your called. Seating at the bar is a must to try. Food is excellent. Service top notch. Must try and you will return often as we do.

I ordered the salmon fillet and it was excellent in quality and portion size. My dad ordered the red snapper fillet and when I tried a little, there was a piece of bone which kinda ruined it for me. Also, the bread wasn't warm at all and the butter was cold and hard, so that's a little annoying. Veggies were ok and the potatoes felt like they were a little old. In terms of portion, it's great. Don't expect having a soup or salad with your meal without having to pay a big price. Staff was friendly and attentive, and it's got that old school atmosphere which is nice. I was expecting this to be a 5 star restaurant considering this is a pricey restaurant, and only worth visiting once in my opinion.
