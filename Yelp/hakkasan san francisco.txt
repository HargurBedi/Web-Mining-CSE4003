Full disclaimer: We went to Hakkasan as part of a group, so prices weren't an issue (to us), the menu was set, and we were in a private room.Okay, whew, now that that's out of the way. The food here is unreal!! So creative and delicious. There is so much depth of flavor, and unique smells and literally food as art. We started with various dumplings, which were all amazing and came out in tiny steamer baskets. Next we had egg fried rice (really the only thing I wasn't super impressed with), pumpkin and duck dumplings in the sample of adorable pumpkins, lettuce wraps, clay pot chicken, stir fried beef, a lotus root and asparagus salad, and finally macaroons and incredible little chocolate truffles. It was a really great lunch, and the family-style service made it a fun way to interact with the other people in our group after sitting in conference sessions all morning.

Let's start out with the obvious: this isn't Panda Express pricing by any stretch. It's in Union Square, it's a large restaurant, beautifully styled, and it's a see and be seen kind of place. They have locations in Dubai, Miami and London. You get the picture. Don't expect a $10 entree. We knew what we were getting into. The $15 cocktails were excellent. The truffle scallop noodles, roast duck and smoked ribs were all great. The duck and pumpkin appetizer and asparagus and lotus veggies were good. The desserts (banana cake and chocolate dumplings) were fine but I wouldn't get them again. Our waiter and the rest of the server team were attentive. The waiter brought my husband the wrong sake (a hot one, when a cold one was ordered). When questioned the waiter said that's how the sommelier recommended it be served, so my husband drank it - but when the bill came, it was clear that the wrong hot sake had been served. Other than that - it was a good night. I'd go back again.

The golden week menu is to die for, try the beef gnocchi! Great shanghai dumpling were delicious along with the crispy shrimp for little eats. Tiger prawns were unique and tasty. Food quality and ambiance was top notch, minus one star for sub-par service. Our waiter seemed newish, he didn't really provide the "Michelin" star service one would expect from such an establishment.

I can now say I've had bougie dim sum...For some reason, my family and I have been doing it big for everyone's birthdays this year. 2017 is the year of spending, I guess. So we found our way to Hakkasan. The bill came out to approx $400 for 6 people, so that's actually not too bad, all things considered.We decided upon 2 orders of pumpkin puffs (these look like actual small pumpkins, but don't be fooled!), 2 orders of the dim sum sampler ($28 ea and comes with 4 different kinds of steamed goodies, 2 of each), truffle duck ($51 - not my fave), sweet and sour pork (flat strips of pork), Hakka noodles, cod (this is the best, it melts in your mouth), i forgot what it's called, but it was the pork belly dish (looks like adobo, but again, don't be fooled), and the steak cubes...also forgot the proper name - ha, I'm terrible!Overall, you pay for your experience. We made reservations for 8:30pm because that was the only opening left. You take an elevator up to the second floor. They seated us probably 15 minutes sooner because we got there early. Our waitress helped us order, they clear your table between appetizers and entrees, and for dessert on your birthday, you get a macaron! I really liked the table set up, the ambiance of the place just makes you feel classy, and let's not forget, you get a hot towel at the end of your meal to wipe your hands.

Along the hustle and bustle of Market Street, it's easy to walk past Hakkasan without noticing it. That makes it all the more fun to take the elevator up to the second floor of the One Kearny building and enter a swanky, softly lit restaurant. The gold and deep blue accents add to the luxurious feel. I came here recently with some of my favorite coworkers and we were in for a real treat. Everything we ordered was delicious. From Roasted duck pumpkin puffs to Truffle braised noddles with crab to Grilled Sea Bass with Chinese honey, each dish had its own exquisite flavor. Every course was also plated beautifully, including the decadent desserts. We ordered the Asian pear tart with hazelnut cream and the chocolate dumplings. Ginger tea was poured around the dumplings, adding even more flavor. The evening slipped by in a moment with the wonderful company and fabulous food. And while the menu is pricey, it's perfect for a special occasion. Now to find more reasons to come back and celebrate.

A hidden oasis of fine dining, luscious decor, and polished service. Perched above the bustle of Market Street, Hakkasan is a real treat yo-self spot. As soon as you enter, the smell of incense wafts and pretty plates of dim sum are wisked around. The bar area is gorgeous with deep blue accents, while the dining rooms are separated by intricately carved wood panels. Everything about Hakkasan feels plush and decadent. Food-wise, everything we ordered was a winner. Dim sum dishes come with 3 pieces, and they're gorgeously presented. Loved the shrimp and chive, and purple taro. The duck salad was very unique and not at all gamey. Ideal for a business lunch, celebratory meal, or romantic hideaway. Hakkassan is classy through and through, and the food is divine. The kind of place that makes you want to have wine with lunch, because you're just that fancy.

Perfect for a date night or special celebration. In my case, I came in with my family to celebrate my sister and her husband getting married at SF City Hall just down the street prior to our meal!Dishes are pricey and on the smaller side, but the quality and flavor is there. The dim sum platter was one of my favorite dishes that we tried, and although it's not 100% authentic, it's incredibly delicious and perfectly presented. In fact, it's uniqueness gives it an exciting edge over the standard dim sum! My family and I also really loved the pork belly. The meat was incredibly succulent and melted in your mouth. Divine is an understatement.Service was lovely, and the ambiance was beautiful. I will definitely be coming back, and am looking forward to that day!

First off: definitely returning for lunch, lovely respite from the work day in FiDi if you can afford an hour to chill and take in some bougy dim sum.Celebrating our 2 year anniversary me and my girlfriend took in the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter and the crab & scallop truffle noodles over a Sophie Saison and a Hitachino Ale. All choices were absolutely spot on. I will always get the dim sum if I come here for lunch, and though the truffle noodles were formidable and delicious: explore I will next time. Favorite and most unique dim sum was the peking duck, not going to find that one in your favorite family dim sum joint. Rest were great, but I couldn't help but compare them to some bomb local spots in town that are much lower price point. Look forward to our next visit!

I was taken here for dinner by a customer and it was quite ok. I would not call this place excellent but the food and service was ok, nothing special. We had a bunch of dishes to share and they were all quite nice but nothing really made me go wow. The duck, prawns, salmon and dumplings were all enjoyable but nothing more. The wine list was quite ok and my cocktail was also ok. It was quite busy when we arrived and the staff were quite helpful in getting us seated. The service at the table was a bit slow. It's a relatively expensive place to eat and I expected more. Given the choice of Asian fusion in SF I would probably not come here again. However if someone invited me again, sure why not ;-))

I heard about the upscale Hakkasan restaurant chain through word of mouth. Since I was in SF and staying nearby this location, I had to try it out. The interior was very sleek and modern with great lighting. The bar area setup made me feel like I was at a fancy nightclub.I ordered a Hakka steamed dim sum platter (scallop shumai, har gau, Chinese chive dumpling), the stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye with Merlot, and a selection of house made macarons. The presentation of the dishes was fantastic as you could tell much effort was put into the plating. The food tasted as flavorful as it was appealing to the eye.Between the brand name and their Financial District location, the prices were certainly at a premium, much more so than what one would pay for similar quality Cantonese cuisine in nearby Chinatown. Go to Hakkasan if you want to experience a high end atmosphere matched by high prices. If you want good dim sum without making a serious dent in your wallet, then go to Chinatown.

Food is really good, especially the duck stuffed pumpkin cake. The black pepper beef is great, but the portion is not big enough. The dim sum is good, but a little bit pricey compared to other restaurants. I like the dining environment, really ideal for friends hangout or a date.

Came here twice within a week and made reservations both online. You definitely should make reservations when coming here because this place gets pretty packed and I think a lot of people who walk-in has to wait for awhile. The restaurant is on the second floor and they have a nice decor here. Everything on the menu is on the pricier end for Chinese food. The first time I came here was last Thursday and we got seated right away for our 7pm reservations. We were given our menus and the drinks menu. My friend and I both got the Hakka drink (definitely a recommendation!!) to start off with and some water. After 10 minutes, we ordered our food. We started off with some calamari, dim sum platter, sanpei chicken claypot, egg-stallion fried rice, stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye, and some pak choi veggies! Everything was super delicious! The dim sum platter came with the shumai's, hargau, dumplings and black pepper duck dumpling! The platter is a bit on the expensive end just an FYI. Sanpei chicken claypot was also another good one to try. The chicken had some sweetness and spicy flavors mixed into one! Egg-stallion fried rice was also another favorite of mine and although it's super simple, it definitely goes well with all the dishes. Calamari was okay. Nothing special to be honest. The ribeye beef was to die for though! It was the cherry on top. It was definitely my favorite one out of all. The stir fry had some garlic and it had this crispy noodle looking thing which was pretty good. Overall, the food was excellent and service was great. The waitress/waiters checked up on us every so often. The food came out super quick which they also deserves a star for that. Quick service is always the best and I will definitely come back again on a special occasion.

This is a really nice restaurant in the heart of San Francisco. I came here a while back with friends and the ambiance is great and all the waiting staff is really attentive to your needs and are ready to answer any questions that you may have. I really liked the food and the service out here it was awesome. The buns they give you with your lamb appetizer dish is sooooo damn good it is sooooo soft that you would want to take it home and go to sleep on it. The flavors of all the dishes were really good as well. the only reason why I gave it a 4 star is due to the portion. I found the portions to be really small for the price. Other than that I really liked this restaurant.

I refuse to pay top dollar for dim sum when I know I can have the same or better for less than half the price they charge; I forbade myself from coming here for a long time. Surprisingly, I came with my in-laws (for mother's day lunch) who probably feel the same way I did and they were pleasantly intrigued by everything. First of all, the decor. SEXY. They have a full bar. If I come here at night, I know I will get so LIT.My recommendation is: DO NOT GET DIM SUM because nothing stood out (and trust my palate, I've eaten dim sum all my life), but do get the specialty dishes they have that you would not normally find at Chinese restaurants.Chiu Chow-Style Sea Bass in Clay Pot with Chinese celery and salted plum -Really good flavor and quality Sea Bass in thick hearty sauce. This one was very good and something I've never had. A good dish to share among a group.Truffle Braised Noodle with Crabmeat - Thin noodles that were packed full of truffle taste with 2 large pieces of scallops too. This was my favorite out of all the dishes we had because the smell of truffles is one of my favorite things to smell!Crispy Duck Roll - Crispy on the outside, flakey dark duck meat on the inside. Can't get any better than this!Will I come back? Sure! And I'll be sure to be smart about what I order.

Decent drinks, modern vibe, a nice quiet place to get a drink. Starting to empty out at 10pm on a Saturday, tons of space at the bar. The drinks are fine, but it's very overpriced. I wouldn't necessarily come back with friends as there are way more vibrant (and affordable places) nearby, but it seems like a good place for a business lunch or dinner. * Goodfellas Old Fashioned ($15) - 4 starsThey smoke the glass by actually lighting a piece of wood on fire!  * Smoke & Spice ($14) - 4 starsJust what I needed, a drink with a nice kick.  * Rhubarb Remedy ($13) - 3 starsToo sweet, even for my sweet tooth.

After a not so great experience a few months ago, we decided to give Hakkasan a second chance. Megs- the General Manager was so accommodating for my husband and I and our server Elizabet was one of the best we have ever had. We LOVE the truffle duck, always the best thing on the menu. I also highly recommend the Shanghai dumplings as a starter. We always get a side of the Hakka noodles. My favorite part is the hot towels at the end. I think Hakkasan is on the up and up in San Francisco and my husband and I will definitely be back!

My girlfriend and I stopped by Hakkasan the other day to grab drinks and we loved it! I've actually dined here a few other times with my colleagues, but I can't explain how delicious the drinks are here. The food is very delicious and everything is of great quality. I cannot emphasize enough on how good the drinks are. They are well thought out and well crafted. Each one is made with love and by love I mean, they have a heavy hand. lol I ordered the lychee martini and they are so delicious. They are in a great location and easy access from downtown. Reservations are pretty simple and the service here is always great. Cheers!

This review is for Lunch:From outside, you would never expect to walk into a place like Hakkasan. When you walk into the building, you are instructed to take the elevator up to the second floor. Once you walk out of the elevators, this modern, trendy, and swanky restaurant greets you. I can imagine what's it's like at night when the night owls are out in full effect. However, it was during the day, for lunch, with coworkers so the vibe was completely different. The restaurant was freezing! By the time lunch was over I couldn't feel my toes, but the service was outstanding. Our water glass was never empty and our servers were very attentive. Food was great. They definitely have some unique dishes and the presentation was phenomenal. However, I couldn't justify paying 3x the price for the typical dim sum items that you can get at every other restaurant and they taste the same. The table ordered a bunch of items and they were all very good. I highly recommend the roasted duck pumpkin puff. Duck was perfectly seasoned and was complimented with the crispy puff. Overall, this place may be pricy for dim sum, however it's mainly for the atmosphere and some of their dishes are actually worth it.

Came in for lunch and seated promptly, despite not having a reservation. This place quickly filled up during our meal, the staff was busy throughout the restaurant. They probably could've used more servers, but I digress.What a great meal we had! We each started off with some eggy hot and sour soup. Our dim sum included: crispy duck roll, morel crystal dumpling (steamed), and chive flower dumpling (steamed). Everything tasted great! Loved the meal and I will definitely return.

Ultimately I had a nice time at this restaurant, and think it's a great place to try something new and different in a nice atmosphere with a group of people or on a date. I did find the menu a little confusing, it really could've used more information or maybe even photos just to help you wrap your head around how big or small each dish is. Went with a large group and was able to try many things. The Seabass was very well received at the table, as was the lotus root with carrots and shaved asparagus. We were disappointed in the truffled noodles. Their dessert menu was unique and diverse.

Okay, so I'll start by saying that Hakkasan wasn't what I was looking for. I came here for lunch one afternoon looking for dim-sum and yelp suggested Hakkasan as it was pretty close to my location. This is not an authentic Chinese restaurant, but rather an upscale restaurant with a cantonese bent. The Chicken and abalone shumai was pretty good as was their Sea bass daikon roll. The sticky rice in lotus leaf was really good. The Chinese green vegetables were not bad. However, their salt and pepper squid was way over-fried and not at all what I was expecting. It did not taste good at all. If you come for dim-sum order several dishes, because the size of the dishes is pretty small. The Jasmine tea here was delicious. Contrary to what has been written in the reviews, I found the service to be quite good. A bit reserved and formal, but not at all snooty. The ambience is excellent. You also get the feeling that all of the ingredients that go into the food at Hakkasan are top quality. However, if you're in the mood for authentic dim-sum, I'd suggest finding some restaurants near China town.

As you youngins say, this place is sexy AF!This is swanky as swanky gets. Dark wood, low lighting, sexy bar area ;-)All eyes will be on you when you enter through Hakkasan's space because you won't feel self-conscious in your black bodycon dress since everyone else will be dressed to the nines! Isn't it nice to go to a SF restaurant where folks made the effort to put on clothes other than the usual hoodie and jeans combo that's oh so tech style?!Enough ranting, let's talk about that eye catching bar. From drinks to design, it wows. The hypnotizing cool blue color of the bar will cast a weird glow on your cocktails, but the taste of your well made drinks will be amazing. My non-alcoholic shiso spritz is light bodied and refreshing. And if you're into pretty looking cocktails, the Floating Goddess will surely satisfy: Grey Goose Vodka, muddled blueberries, elderflower and grapefruit juice. Do notice the sexy stem of your cocktail glass. HAWT damn.Food items are meant to be shared and it will be to your advantage so you can get a sampling of the whole menu, This being Chinese food, expect choices to be heavy on pork and duck. I loved the crispy duck rolls, stir fry black pepper ribeye in Merlot sauce and crispy pumpkin puffs. My personal favorite was the seared foie salad and I would've loved to have this all to myself since there were fat chunks of foie in there. Of course, we had to order the 8 piece Hakka dimsum platter priced at $28 (!) It's certainly the most expensive dim sum I've had and my Chinese dad would NOT have approved at all, but it had scallop siu mai and black pepper duck dumplings. Desserts are not to be missed, especially the very special apple tart. You'll have an incredible dining experience at Hakkasan and the prices may not feel like so, but you know that coming into the restaurant already. I just bought a bunch of date night dresses so I hope that's enough HINT for the fiance to bring me here for another sexy time!

Hakkasan has a reputation for serving Chinese/Cantonese food with a Western touch in a polished, swanky environment. My first visit here came recently on a Saturday evening and our reservations were early enough to allow me to soak in the refined setting they have so carefully built without the intensity of the masses that were sure to follow after we had already finishing our dining experience. I started off my evening with a cocktail of course(Bitter Fortune - Junipero Gin, Aperol, grapefruit juice, lime juice) which was served in a long stemmed cocktail glass, and it was quite the stiff treat. We went family style and shared several enjoyable dishes, notably the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter(scallop shumai, har gau, Chinese chive dumpling and black pepper duck dumpling), Crispy Pumpkin Puff, and the Whitebait Fried Rice. You do not come here to fill yourself up with value priced authentic Chinese food but rather an Eastern cuisine experience with a Western twist. Setting your expectations properly will go a long way towards having an enjoyable experience. Our waiter was wonderfully charming and polished. Although I may be somewhat reluctant to return for dinner, I would not hesitate to try their lunch menu which I understand is more Dim Sum centric.

A very unique experience in a town overrun with restaurants, this place delivers on beauty, mystery, and club scene. Most importantly, the food was very good. I've had many dim sum feasts but this place has elevated the humble dim sum to high art. My favorite dim sum here was the pumpkin duck puff. Not to be missed is the cod in champagne sauce, delicate and delicious, I swear they snuck butter into that champagne sauce. The service was impeccable and cocktails were very good. I really felt transported by the whole experience and then like a time traveler, the spell broke when I took the elevator back down to Kearny and Market street.

Wow. I definitely did not grow up eating this well. I would recommend everything that I got to try: lobster soup/bisque, duck confit salad, whitebait fish fried rice, snow peas (super fresh and sweet!) with mock chicken, & braised beef tenderloin (very scrumptious). The amount of food we ordered was sufficient to keep us full, though our wallets a little light afterwards.Honestly, the food's not truly authentic Chinese but rather Chinese-inspired dishes with Western flair (trust the Yelpers - don't come here to get the dim sum platter, but rather get the unusual/exquisite dishes); however all the dishes were delicious and exquisite. Excellent drinks all around too - definitely be sure to get the Hakkasan, Spice of Life, and cedar smoked drink (can't remember the name). I highly recommend making a reservation now!

TLDR: Great lunch menu deal. Amazing food and atmosphere for a great price.Finally got around to coming here on a Monday off. The place is upstairs in the building and you have to take the elevator to get there. The atmosphere is very fancy and expensive. I actually felt a little under dressed going in.My friend and I both ordered the $30 set meal (of course) but we picked different items from it.Seafood DimSum: I think this was my favorite. It came with three individual pieces and each one was delicious. Most dimsum will have pork with their seafood dishes but this one was 100% seafood. The scallop shumai had a whole scallop in it, it looked beautiful and tasted awesome.Claypot Fish: Ordered this with the egg fried rice. Flavor was really good but I a little tired of it halfway through because of how strong it was. Coupled with the egg friend rice, I was a little overwhelmed by the constant flavor. This might just be a personal preference though because I always have issues with eating a lot of foods that are very umami.Macaron: They brought us six for the both of us. Each one was different and we wanted to try them all so we cut them in half. I don't usually like Macarons because I feel like they are a little over hyped taste wise. These ones were pretty good though, and trying each one to figure out the flavor was really fun.Overall definitely the lunch menu is definitely a steal. The quality is more than worth the price. If I do come back, I might just end up ordering the dim sum though because that was my absolute favorite.

The interior was very pretty and the service wasn't bad. Why did I give it 2 stars?Well the food was pretty mediocre. Maybe I'm harsh after eating Chinese food my entire life but to be an acclaimed Michelin star restaurant, I guess my expectations were a little high.Also, the menu has some lies in it and the employees were pretty stubborn.We ordered their angelroot steamed chicken. If anyone has ever eaten or even smelled angelroot, you would know of its strong scent. (People literally thought it was poisonous because of the smell until someone tried it out) When the chicken came out, there was no scent or taste of angelroot and when we confronted the waiters, they were resilient on the fact that they had indeed put angelroot.

First time here first class all the way. Excellent attention to detail gorgeous interior and a dining delight. Staff are on top of everything and describe the menu fantastically! Food is amazing and delicious our server was great in recommending pairings of food. Rather pricy but worth it. The only let down was one of the tofu dishes which was a little bland but all the seafood dishes were divine , the short ribs mouthwatering, desserts were rather small and not for sharing. Drinks were good and the flow of the food was spot on. This is a great fun place for dinner and I would definitely come here again. Make a reservation it's right on the corner of market and Kearney on the second floor

I went to Hakkasan for the first time a few weeks ago with a co-worker from India. She had the assorted dim sum (veggie style) and I had the prawns. The presentation was beautiful and the ambiance was chic and hip. Definitely a place to take IG photos. Both items were delicious, but I have to say, they were certainly over priced. The dishes were just as good as other Chinese restaurants, but I guess the price matches the atmosphere. I'd come back again if my company pays for it. LOL

My 4th time at Hakkasan was just as exciting as the first few, thanks to the pricing and speediness of the "Taste of Hakkasan" weekday lunch! We came in today and were pleasantly surprised by how large the portions were considering the 3-course pre-fixe was only $39 a person. While I wouldn't dare pay that much ANYWHERE else, really, a place like Hakkasan is usually $$$$, so that's quite the bargain to try a solid sampling of what this place has to offer! As always, the staff provided the expected purrs of "very good, sir" and "that's my favorite" for every order uttered, but were also personable and warm. The lunch vibe was a little less stuffy, with folks dressed in holiday sweaters and jeans in place of the usual suit and dress seen here. Plenty of brogrammers guffawing and saleswomen toasting could also be spotted dining out on their SF lunch breaks- familiar sights for me as a FiDi office worker. Each of the courses were SUPER tasty! It was my first time trying their dim sum and I was surprised by how good it was. My favorites were the flaky puff pastries and the ribeye with garlic, along with my "Hong Kong Dusk" cocktail. The only things that weren't mind-blowing for us were the macarons, and the fact that I called ahead to specify "special occasion" which they forgot. Oh well! The food and experience otherwise made it worth the price tag, especially to celebrate said special occasion. I would definitely come back, though probably not until my bank account has time to recover from the holidays. If you're looking for the most economical way to sample a fancy shmancy restaurant, Hakkasan's weekday lunch prix-fixe is definitely your way in! Have fun, keep your pinky up, and try not to drool too much from all the dim sum deliciousness under your nose.

Hakkasan is up-scale and delicious. You'll love the truffle braised noodle (never had anything like it!), crispy duck salad, poached beijing peking dumpling, taro and crab croquette (YUM), and the roast duck pumpkin puff!

More of a 3.5-- four star food, but rounded down because the prices were just a bit much in some cases. My favorites were the clay pot sea bass and the truffle and scallop fried noodles-- the fish was perfectly tender and flaky, and the sauce, while thick and heavy, had a hint of acidity that helped break through the richness of the flavors. The truffle and scallop fried noodles were absolutely delicious; while I felt like the crab meat was a bit extra and didn't add much to the flavors of the dish, the truffle and scallop flavors complemented each other beautifully, and I loved the addition of different varieties of mushrooms mixed with the noodles. For dessert, I really liked the matcha mousse, which came with a very fragrant tea foam and a few cream puffs.The dim sum was pretty normal yet exorbitantly priced and the pipa duck, while fried perfectly, was also quite overpriced for the portion size. Overall, good food and ambiance, but you're definitely paying for that and more.

Lunch review -Food: We got the 3 course lunch special ($30 per person) that comes with an app, main, and dessert. We each got different apps and mains to share and they were delicious. We had two different types of dim sum, pepper beef & prawns. For dessert we got some yummy macarons!Service: Everyone was very nice but the service was really slow. Given that we came in for lunch during a work week I would expect faster service (wouldn't be able to come here during a 1-hour lunch break). So we had to take our macarons to go!

A last minute find while looking for somewhere to eat. We were able to get a 5pm reservation later that afternoon which was perfect for us. Food was delicious and well presented. I really appreciated them bringing out my kids' meal right away as they were starving! Also appreciated all of great vegetarian options! Noodles, dumplings, tofu, veggies...I was quite pleased. We had the veg sampler dumplings (minus the one with egg), Hakka noodles, and the tofu dish. Even non-veg hubby liked the dumplings & noodles (but not tofu). Overall food was good, cool vibe and a fun place to try in SF. One star down for the waiter. He was kind and polite but not warm and friendly. And if you're veg be specific about what you will eat (like any other restaurant) as the waiter didn't clarify and we ended up with egg in our food. I guess I just expected more here...

I was excited to try Hakkasan's SF location for my first time. We had early reservations on a nice Saturday night. When we were seated, I noticed the interior was modern and tastefully done. Our waiter, very happy and polite, immediately took our drink orders. I went with the Floating Goddess(Grey Goose, blueberries, elderflower, grapefruit juice) and the waiter joked he knew I was going to order that drink. The drink was very strong and fruity enough to not taste too overpowering.We decided to go the family style route and shared a bunch of dishes. I enjoyed the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter which had a duck dumpling, scallop shumai, chive dumpling, and har gau. This Dim Sum platter for dinner was fun to have. Another fun dish was the Crispy Pumpkin Puff, which tasted like a traditional Dim Sum dish that I don't remember the name of but that has a deep fried outer coating with a chewy/starchy pork filling, but in this case with a pumpkin flavor twist. Finally, we had the Whitebait Fried Rice which was chewy and not too oily. Overall, my first dinner experience was quite good but in the end I feel Hakkasan is more about the experience than the actual food which is fine as long as you're prepared to accept this before coming. I would be curious to try their brunch menu and see how that experience stacks up with other fine dining Dim Sum restaurants.

We were in town visiting and heard that this place was great and it lived up to the expectations. We had more than 4 people so we did one of their set menus for $88 a person. The food was so good but definitely be prepared to eat a lot! I should have skipped lunch for more room. The atmosphere is really great. Only thing is it was so busy that I feel like we didn't get much attention from our waiter for what we paid.

Very disappointed with last night's dinner experience. The staff were aloof, no customer friendly care here, they gave us the impression we should be honored to be served by them, very bizarre! As for the food, very average and then to cap it all off we were presented with a rather large Check! Extremely overrated, we will not be returning anytime soon!

I knew I shouldn't place too much expectation when it comes to Chinese food at US, but people say so many good things about Hakkasan that I have to try it.Had just basic dim sum (har gou, Shanghai mini bun, pumpkin duck etc). The shrimp and pork was great, but when it comes to artisanship, it's like Meh. The har gou skin was not silky enough, and the outer layer of the pumpkin duck is not fully cooked. Plus, everything was a bit too salty. Will probably come again for the entrees and main dishes, but the dim sum was just not my style.

To celebrate opening its first location in London 15 years ago, Hakkasan is offering a limited time menu series called "Only At". Each of their locations has an exclusive menu, and I was able to preview the Only At San Francisco menu.Most of the dishes on the menu were really delicious. My favorites were the crispy duck salad, Szechuan style cold pork belly rolls, lamb tenderloin with buns, and three-style mushroom stir fry. My number one favorite, though, was dessert. The Asian pear tart was beautifully plated. The pear sorbet was sweet and refreshing. The chocolate-hazelnut cremeux and miso caramel were silky. They were topped with a continuous paper-thin ribbon of super sweet, crunchy pear.Beautiful ambiance. Delicious food. Will be back again.

When it comes to comparing higher-end Chinese food and authentic Chinese food sold in the nooks and crannies of Chinatown, there's honestly not much of a difference except one LOOKS better. Hakassan's food wasn't an OMG moment because I've had so much Chinese food in my life at 1/6th of the price that is arguably better! However, the food here is still great and it's a nice restaurant for dates or dinners with friends/SOs. Ambience is so cool and it's on the 2nd floor!Things I tried:Eggroll: Crispy on the outside, savory on the inside. Loved that they had a good meat to veggie ratio and don't be shy on the sauce. Fried Rice (not pictures): Probably the most disappointing fried rice I've had for the price. Given it's served here, I kind of expected more flavor but meh. If you order it, make sure you eat it with the other dishes. Braised Pork: Nicely flavored and tender. Almost can't go wrong with braised pork.Mapo Tofu: I love mapo tofu but this one wasn't spicy at all :( It's definitely more Americanized in that it's sweeter and the tofu isn't soft like the traditional mapo tofu. But still good (esp. with that fried rice..)

Pricey but the quality of the food is amazing! The restaurant is beautiful and the service is extremely attentive and nice.My favorites were the baked lamb chop, stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye, and jasmine tea smoked spare ribs. The meat was so juicy and tender. The grilled sea bass was buttery and slightly sweet. It practically melted in my mouth. The truffle braised noodle with crabmeat and scallop was good although I thought the other items were better. For dessert I really enjoyed the black sesame and chocolate dumplings which was extremely unique and the coconut sago pudding.Overall I would definitely be back but only for a special occasion.

Loved this place! The restaurant is on the second floor, and immediately you're greeted with amazing service and a sexy atmosphere. They made Chinese cuisine exotic, which is a combination I'm definitely not used to but love. Our hostess, bartender and our waiter were super sweet and really took their time to explain the menu. I ordered the hot and sour soup and vegetarian mapo tofu. Neither blew my mind, but it was good! You can order rice or noodles as your source of carbs and I ordered both (don't judge). I can't wait to come back and explore more of their menu.

Hakkasan is my favorite Asian-Fusion restaurant in SF- the food is even fresher and made with better ingredients than the NYC location. Get the veggie dumplings as they are so unique and not your typical dumpling. The sticky rice for lunch is super yummy. What I love most about this restaurant is that being on the 2nd floor, you get a beautiful outlook onto Union and the trees, which is rare for that part of SF.

We ordered the Hakka dim sum platter and the sampei chicken claypot with Thai basil leaves. The dim sum was tasty especially the shumai. The other ones were okay. It comes in two pieces each and 4 different types (total of 8 pieces). As for the sampei chicken claypot, it came out sizzling which was pretty cool. Sweetness was just perfect, but I'd recommend paying a few bucks to get jasmine rice otherwise it can be salty after several pieces. The service was alright and the ambiance was really nice. The food is a little on the higher end of the price.

I was lucky enough to go to Hakkasan with clients and coworkers. A party of five meant we could do lots of sharing! Family-style dining is encouraged here, although they do also offer a businessman's special three course lunch menu for the reasonable price of $31 M-F. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the famous Kearny building. There's an elevator so don't worry about having to roll yourself out of here after chowing down! The scent of incense was very strong as we exited the elevator, but luckily that didn't permeate into the dining room. Y'ALL THE DECOR. Not only is the ambiance really nice, but Hakkasan boasts an absolutely gorgeous contemporary design with an Asian influence. Service was great. Our sweet waitress was very patient and was especially helpful with the menu and our assorted dietary restrictions. She was all over it so thanks to her for enhancing the experience!On to the food... per usual we WAY over-ordered! It's easy here to go overboard, just a heads up. DIM SUM (which came three pieces per order for the most part):- Chicken and abalone shumai ($29): honestly, our least favorite of the dim sum which was mostly due to texture. These came three to order and were served in a steamer basket.- Char siu bao ($5): three lovely BBQ pork dumplings in a soft, doughy wrapper; also served in a steamer basket- Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling ($5): classic fried dumpling shaped like a half moon, and exactly what you'd expect!- Roast duck and pumpkin puff ($8): FABULOUS tender duck stuffed inside of a pumpkin-flavored wrapper. Highly recommended! - Pan-fried turnip cake with dried shrimp and Chinese sausage ($6): note - these are made with shrimp and pork so keep an eye out if you're veg! This was one you could order just one piece of because it can easily be cut and shared. Really delicious with a great soft texture. - Crispy prawn dumpling with plum sauce ($7): show-stopping fried prawns with large crispy "tails" made from crispy fried wontons (possibly?) and served in a chili garlic-style sauce. Delicious!NON-DIM SUM ITEMS:- Crispy Duck Salad ($28): TO DIE FOR!!! Get this or regret it forever.- Braised free-range chicken ($19): the chicken still had the skin on and quite frankly was very bland. It tasted boiled. Arguably the least favorite dish of the entire experience, and a rare miss.- Szechuan Mabo tofu with minced beef ($15): fantastic! The tofu was not the soft, silky kind I expected but larger and firmer chunks. We also ordered a side of scallion fried rice, which they served for us, to eat this with. Very yummy - like Szechuan comfort food! - Four vegetable treasure in sweet Szechaun sauce ($17): basically a vegetable stir-fry. It was a nice difference from all the carb-heavy items we'd ordered. - Truffle braised noodle with crabmeat and scallop ($30): excellent but heavy on truffle flavor. Not that it's food specifically but there is a list of hot teas available for anyone who wants something warm. We split a pot of Classical Beauty (oolong tea). All the teas are served by the pot. This one was really nice with a bold oolong flavor. Overall - recommended!

Hakkasan is a semi pricey Chinese/Asian restaurant. You're paying a little more for the pretty setup of the food. The cocktails were different and refreshing. They tasted good and had a nice little kick of alcohol. They're known for their colored dumpling set which was actually pretty bomb dot com. The braised oxtail was melt off the bone goodness. I didn't really like the "jumbo" prawns. It wasn't terrible, just wasn't the best dish on the menu. For our anniversary they gave us some macs. I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try some of their other "must-have" items.

On the corner of Kearny and Market lies an exquisite, seemingly upscale electric blue bar and dining fortress, so hot an elevator must raise patrons to the second level. Secured a Saturday reservation a month in advance on Open Table for 6 at 6:30pm. Beware the $50/person no show/48 hour cancellation policy for 5+ guests. We arrived 15 minutes early and were seated immediately to the right of the bar. It's a bit more intimate in this area. Upon further investigation, i.e. on the hunt for the restroom, we noticed the left orange seat side was brighter with views of Market street, more social with thin delicately crafted metal room dividers (easier to look through the bar scene). Our area's view? An abundance of foliage. Ask for the left orange Market street side, if possible.Typing up a list of what to order in advance is my specialty. No accurate pricing until I glanced at the menu. It took my friends a while to decide. I chose:Hakka steamed dim sum platter: 8 pieces for $28*2 each of: har gaw-- first piece I ate! Yum, thick almost emulsified shrimp enveloped in a sticky gelatinous rice coating resembling a shell. *scallop siumai with orange masago eggs on top-- tasty, figured the scallop is in the middle? *green wrapper enclosing shrimp and green chives-- loaded with colorful ingredients inside, carrots?*black pepper duck dumpling was sweet--least favorite of the 4Crispy duck salad for $28. Definitely get this! Bottom layer of duck fried to a gentle crisp similar to soft shell crab in Japanese spider rolls, fluffy mountain of wafercress/alfalfa sprout looking greens, plenty of pine nuts & pomegranate seeds adorning the dish, a few smidges of tart grapefruit, and two paper thin crisps of lotus flower. It's pretty large. They offer to toss it but the need to capture a photo relinquished their duty to our table. My friends ordered one as an app while mine arrived as an entree. Not knowing how to toss it correctly, the sweet salad dressing permeated my senses. Everyone else thought the salad appealed to their salty tastebuds. Egg & scallion fried rice was good! $8 for a portion large enough to feed 2-3 people. We ordered two. Tried the pork belly clay pot. Lots of fat, luckily my friend gave me a meaty piece. Not bad. Omg the black truffle oil duck was astounding. I had the last bits of meat and soaked up some of the truffle oil. I'm used to white truffle oil so this one tasted heavier, but still fantastic!7 pieces of assorted macarons for $15 ended the meal. We had a tough time deciding if we'd all get one and share the remainder *cough purple black currant/cassis cough* or if we'd take a bite and pass it along. Surprisingly, that flavor was better than some others because it wasn't as sweet! The fragile meringue-like tops/bottoms were too sugary. Cassis & passionfruit had edible glitter on top!*Flavors: Pb strawberry jam Lemon poppyseedBlack currant cassisPistachioBlood orangePassion fruitGreen teaService was great! Dean M. and staff made us feel welcome and appreciated. Helpful with dish questions and we never felt rushed. I'd like to try out their lunch special one day-- $25-30 for steamed dim sum, entree, and macarons!

This restaurant is devoted to quality, even beyond my expectations.Of course we've all known the Hakkasan in Vegas as both a club and a restaurant. But I had never experienced the restaurant, and was happy to see that there has been one in my local area of SF for a while.I was so psyched to see some of the pictures on Yelp! I couldn't wait to go!I told myself I would be trying only the non-alcoholic drinks, since they have a huge variety - but that didn't happen. Haha. If you check out my photos, I got a couple drinks. The first one, which is green with cucumber and kiwi, was my favorite. We ordered the corn and crab soup which is similar to an egg drop soup. It was very good and flavorful. It is a one person serving.Also got the appetizer of dumplings. Multicolored and pretty! And delicious! My least favorite was the brownish one, but that doesn't mean it was bad - just not as good as the others. More of a rich, deep taste. It was also very mushy compared to the others. We couldn't really pick it up with chopsticks without splitting it in half. It was most likely just the most fresh dumpling, and that's why. They were served with three sauces, and all mixed together were very good.I got the tofu claypot as a main dish, and my boyfriend got the yellow curry. We were both very happy with our meals. However, we were surprised that the rice we ordered was only a single person serving. However I eat very little rice with my meals and gave it mostly to him. It was fine, and the server let us know as he brought it out - he offered to get another.At dessert time I was super excited because I THOUGHT I had ordered one of the big bowl pudding dishes (with the break-away top) that I saw in the pictures of Yelp.... however they came out with a banana bread type dessert? Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, and we didn't complain. But I was a tad disappointed... However at a really nice restaurant like this, I hesitate to say about something that's just a small miscommunication. Besides, it's just an excuse to come back for what I originally wanted! Haha. :)By the way, throughout our whole meal, the manager kept coming around serving us as well. He kept checking in and was nitpicking his servers. I love it! You could tell he was passionate about his job and the restaurant.I really want to come back here on another date night. It's so exciting to have such a quality restaurant near us.

This is the 2nd location of Hakkasan I've been to, and it was at least as good or better than the Miami one. First we started with drinks at the bar, and we tried some kind of 12 year old Coffey Grain Japanese whiskey that was fabulous and they do 2 oz pours. We moved to our table, and started with our favorite from Miami, the duck salad, and I think it might have been meatier and crispier this time. Our next dish was tea smoked spare ribs which I highly recommend if you like a unique smokey flavor with a glazey BBQ sauce. Our final dishes were spicy shrimp, which had a nice kick without being too hot, and the pork belly hot pot with cloud mushrooms (highly recommended). For dessert, we had these dumplings that looked like regular ones but they pour ginger tea over them and they have chocolate inside and one coconut one.Recommended. Pretty reasonable prices too, we shared a decent bottle of sake and it was about $75 a person, without cocktails.

Best cocktails and bourbon I've ever had the pleasure to taste.The food! We ordered so much, but I seriously inhaled everything. From the ribs, to the dim sum, to the lobster.. I can't even contain myself just thinking about it. I've tried to go back on many separate occasions, but keep forgetting they close on Sundays. I'm drooling just thinking about my next visit.The ambiance indoors is A+++ as well. It's like a cool little night club strictly for dining and drinking. The bathrooms are really.. really cool too.

Asian fusion is usually a fine line between innovative and too westernized, but Hakkasan walks this line well, with inventive, beautiful, and absolutely delicious food. I came with a group of 5; note that most dim sum items are sizes of 3, occasionally 4. Service is very good, but nothing special. Last time I came was for my birthday, and they did give me a complementary macaron with a candle, which was lovely. For those interested in a detailed rundown, we ordered:Roast duck pumpkin puff (must have) - first, they come out looking like these adorable little pumpkins, so A+ for presentation. The taste is also very unique, with a crispy pumpkin exterior enclosing a savory and juicy mix of duck. The pumpkin is slightly sweet and so good. Pan-seared Shanghai dumpling (very good) - tasty, not greasy, surprisingly light potstickers. Goes great with either vinegar or the chili sauce provided. Lotus beancurd roll (very good) - super creamy, rich filling wrapped in beancurd. This one definitely exceeded expectations - the texture was amazing and very unique. Char siu bao (very good) - I'm usually not a huge fan of bbq pork buns because the meat can taste cheap, fake, and over processed. But Hakkasan does it right, with fresh, savory pork tidbits in a thick sauce. The wrapper is also soft, fluffy, and subtlety sweet. Daikon puff (very good) - again, A+ on presentation. These little puffs come out colored and shaped like carrots. Adorable! Taste matches the looks, but layers of buttery, flaky pastry wrapping hot, chopped daikon. No overpowering radish taste, just warm flaky deliciousness. Jade lobster daikon roll (okay) - the chunk of lobster in the middle of the roll was kind of tough. Overall I thought the daikon and lobster did not complement each other that well, and there wasn't a very distinct flavor. Prawn and pak choi dumpling (good) - your standard dim sum dumpling. Skin was appropriately thin, filling appropriately tasty, but nothing spectacular. Scallop shumai (okay) - I've had better (and more affordable) shumai. The scallop didn't really hit that meaty, juicy shumai taste I was looking for. Stir fry black pepper rib eye beef (must-have) - this dish is just amazing. The beef bits are bite-sized, tender, juicy. Each bite is a punch of spice and flavor. Pipa duck (very good) - thinly sliced duck topped with crisped skin and a thin layer of fat. Comparably good to Beijing duck in China. Truffle braised noodle with crabmeat and scallop (okay) - probably can skip out on this one. The noodles were very thin and fine, oddly crunchy. The truffle taste was interesting but sadly did not justify the price tag. Green tea mousse (must have) - creamy green tea mousse paired with cute little vanilla cream puffs and raspberry sorbet. The tartness of the sorbet paired well with the sweet vanilla and mild green tea. Caramel and chocolate cremeaux (very good) - rich chocolate and ice cream, a satisfying finish to a savory meal. Assorted macarons (good) - an assortment of interesting flavors (blood orange, peanut butter jelly, lemon poppyseed, black currant, green tea), but the other desserts are likely a more unique and better representation of Hakkasan. Overall very good Asian fusion, with unique and tasty food. Of course, more expensive than your average Dim sum place.

Outstanding!We tried a number of appetizers and a few other dishes -- each was flavorful and well prepared and presented. Service was excellent. The drink menu includes a large collection of wines as well as signature drinks and interesting beers.

Awesome is an understatement. Everything from decor to ambience to fare to fine dining is all wrapped up dim-sum style.Beautiful appointment of design and staff and service. Love is visibly detailed here. I've decided to make this my monthly jaunt to perpetuate my self love affair.Indeed, one feels warmth and exclusivity in one fell swoop. I went in lightly and exited fully with just having sampled the duck salad, which was everything. My goal is to sample one item per visit to acquaint myself with luxury and livelihood in one fine bite. See y'all on Labor Day weekend, as I've already booked my reservation and my hotel stay.1mo later...See...I like to be treated like royalty, regardless of little or large remittance. Victor takes the time to know the name of each guest. Can we say minimum 25% to 50% gratuity, boys & girls?

Everything from value, quality of food, and service was excellent. We had only tried the lunch menu and price was very good for the food we got.Portion was perfect, but pls keep in mind we are not used to American's huge size. Alcohol was very expensive though, as typical of fine dining. If you skip the alcohol, the lunch price can be best value.

As classy as the Las Vegas nightclub.The Taste of Hakkasan lunch menu, at $29 for three courses, is a steal. It's offered 11:30am - 2:30pm, Monday through Friday, reservations accepted. After taking the elevator to the second floor (where are the stairs??), you'll find that the restaurant is not that crowded at lunch.We started off with a pot of the ORCHID PAO CHUNG TEA, $8 per person, which contains a bit of caffeine. I had never had orchid tea before, and this was a delicious first.The lunch menu allows you to choose one appetizer and one entree, and it defaults to macarons for dessert. My friend and I opted to share the STEAMED DIM SUM SELECTION (scallop shumai, har gau, and prawn and Chinese chive dumpling) and the FRIED DIM SUM SELECTION (roasted duck and pumpkin puff, crispy prawn dumpling, XO scallop puff). Both sets were equally delicious--definitely a step-up from your traditional dim sum eateries. Also, don't bother asking for kitchen scissors like we did. After a confused look, our server brought us back a butter knife to help split our dim sum items :PFor our entrees, we shared the CHIU CHOW-STYLE SEA BASS IN CLAYPOT with Chinese celery and salted plum and the STIR-FRY BLACK PEPPER RIBEYE BEEF WITH MERLOT. The sea bass dish was generous and delicious, and the sauce went well with rice. The beef was saucy, chewy but not tough. Between the two, I preferred the sea bass. Each entree comes with pak choi (aka bok choy) and your choice of steamed Jasmine rice or egg fried rice. Go for the egg fried rice.Lunch ended with a steamer of 6 randomly picked macarons: pistachio, PB&J, salted caramel, cassis, lemon poppy seed, and blood orange. Their macarons are delicious, and 3 per person is super generous.Our waiter was a bit hard to flag down at times, but the service was courteous, and the ambiance is great.fyi, it seems that they discontinued their secret menu a few months ago, which was supposed to have cheaper, off-menu dim sum items. At least their $29 lunch set is no secret ;)

My co-worker took me here for birthday. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have gone because it's super pricey. So, thank you Co-Worker!Needless to say, the price includes the ambience, the service, and the excellent dim sum which all adds up a pleasant dining experience. Everything we tried were superb and beyond. Each dish was creative, intricately plated, and unbelievably fresh. It's definitely a special treat for a special occasion.

On the anniversary of my start date, my Manager and VP took me out to lunch as a celebration. Having the power to think of any place of my choice, I wanted to check out Hakkasan! I've been to its counterpart in Vegas and loved it; was curious to see how the SF location stacked up. I was surprised to find out that Calvin Harris was NOT at this location (JUST KIDDING), but I LOVED the ambiance I was treated to when I arrived. You take a short elevator ride to the second floor and are transported to a very upscale, sleek environment. The host/hostess station is the first thing you see, then the massive focal point known as the bar. Beautiful dim lighting in different colors creates a very laid back sort of mood. There are dining seats all around, great for small or large parties. The staff is super accommodating: you have your main server and server assistances all around. Someone for water, someone to help clean up and bus your table, someone to take your order. Lots of help throughout your service. Makes it hard to remember everyone's name but overall, everyone was cordial. We came in for lunch and I can tell you, THE BEST option for you is the Taste of Hakkasan. Only served from 11:30am-2:30pm, this 3 course meal includes it all and runs you around $30. Here's what I had:First course: You can choose from Steamed dim sum, fried dim sum or lettuce wraps. I chose the steamed options which came with three different types of dim sum: scallop shumai, har gau and prawn and chive dumpling. OMG, so delicious! My favorite was the har gau, full of shrimp, but all were great bites. Second course: You can choose from 5 items: fish, veggies and other proteins. I chose the Chiu chow-style sea bass in claypot with Chinese celery and salted plum G. BY FAR, my FAVORITE dish. The sea bass was perfectly cooked, lots of protein and flavored sooooo well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!Third course: There's only one option, the selection of macarons. They give you three various flavors. Very good for macarons, I wished I liked it more as an overall dish. No really a macarons type of person. WOW! I love this place! The service was on point, the food was bomb and not too heavy. I'm definitely coming back for dinner sometime. If it's as good as their lunch menu, then I'm in for a great experience for dinner!
