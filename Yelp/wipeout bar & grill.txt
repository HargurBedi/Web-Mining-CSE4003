Went here for a casual lunch and got the fish sandwich. It was a pretty standard fish sandwich but delicious nonetheless. The meal was filling and not terribly overpriced for the location. There is an obvious premium that comes with eating on the coast/bay, but my wallet didn't feel too burdened after dinning here. The service was good and our food came out in a timely manner. The whole restaurant has a SoCal surfer/beach theme which they even extended to the bathroom design. That's a lot of dedication. Fun and casual atmosphere with plenty of TVs showing various nature, beach, and standard programming. I had a good time and wouldn't mind going back.

Typical touristy restaurant. Only tried the wings and chili. Both were just ok. Tasted like Wolf brand chili and Tyson frozen wings. The service was good, though.Fyi: they charge a 5% healthcare fee.

This was a great place to eat right in the heart of Pier 39. If you like people watching, make sure to get a seat outside on their patio. They were definitely busy, but our party of four was instantly seated for dinner.The pizza was delicious, and the bacon cheeseburger was yummy too. All of the portions were pretty big, so expect to either share, have leftovers, or take some home. What drew us to this restaurant was the extremely large food portions we saw as we were walking through the pier. We turned around to have dinner there after seeing how delicious everything looked. We were not disappointed!We were not in a hurry and wanted to enjoy dinner... But just know that this restaurant typically stays busy. We weren't exactly waited on hand and foot, but we were okay with that, as we wanted a relaxing dinner. If you need something, make sure to ask your server right away. Also, this is the only restaurant bathrooms I have been in that allows both men and women in the same bathroom! I was a little surprised at first. Each stall is private, but boys and girls share the same bathroom--just be prepared.

Aww man! Why didn't I come to this place sooner! I've always passed by this restaurant while visiting Pier 39, never giving it any thought whatsoever! Come time for lunch during a busy weekend outing and this place was nominated as our new restaurant of the day. Wipeout Bar & Grill, why have you never caught my attention before? Wipeout, I see you've got a lot of surf food and beach snacks on your menu! Well I'll raise you a barnacle and a hungry stomach in exchange for your finest fried fish sandwich with chips. Throw in some chili for good measure and let me wash it down with your smoothest virgin ocean rum AKA water. Our chosen fare consisted of seafoods and meats! From Chorizo & Chicken pizza, Fish Fried Sandwich, to the Carne Asada Burritos, we definitely had a little land and sea action going on! We had an awesome waitress named Natasha and a patio table with great scenery and shade! Couldn't have asked for a better first time experience at Wipeout!I love eating seafood and on this particular day, I was craving it! Wipeout had a charismatic and fun environment! Our main waitress Natasha and all the other waiters who helped us were super friendly and energetic! In all, I would definitely recommend this place for their great selection of seafoods and other menu items, even if it was only for a Clam Chowder with bread bowl. Surfs up!

The boy friend and I wanted to try some fresh seafood and we decided to stop by at Wipeout Bar & Grill. It's located right at the entrance of Pier 39. We were craving for some fried fish and ordered the fish tacos and fish and chips. Both of our plates were huge and we didn't get a chance to finish it. The battered fish tasted juicy and yummy. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the tortilla for the tacos. It was bit on the dry side so I ended up just eating the fish. This restaurant seems like the to-go place for tourist. Crowded inside and out. Overall, fun experience.AS ALWAYS, NOM FOR LIFE!

It's a decent place to grab your all american favorites - Hamburgers, salads, fish & chips (ok, that last one isn't american but you get my point). They've got the basic favorites on the menu and plenty of drink variety for anyone in the family. The kids can get soda while Mom has a blended cocktail and Dad gets a beer. You can pretty much make every member of the clan happy with the menu here.As far as flavor ... well, the view is great and the prices are fair. The service is great too!

So a solid 4 stars for this escape from reality of San Fran. Took a party of 5 here this time. Been here many times, the food is always fast, hot and delicious.This time aground we had 3 people who have never been here before and they had smoked salmon, American burger and fish sandwich. I had an American burger the GF had a salad. This is a great place to eat, if there's a wait it's very short. They have a massive amounts of seating space.

Looking for a place for a late lunch while walking around Pier 39, this looked like a fun place with a great atmosphere and had food everyone could eat, so we stopped in.The verdict was very positive; the ladies enjoyed the soup and salmon salad and the pineapple chicken breast and pineapple burger were also tasty, and the margarita was also very good.A server can always make the dining experience better, and Natasha couldn't have been better. She was prompt, took our order which included slight deletions or changes on some menu items, was very friendly and helpful and seemed to really enjoy her job.We've eaten at a good number of Pier 39 restaurants while visiting San Francisco and we couldn't have asked for a better lunchtime experience.

4/5 stars for great atmosphere, strong drinks, and good food. This time around we sat at the bar just for drinks, but when I've been in the past with my family we all really enjoyed our meals. The reason for not 5 stars is because the bartender seemed very busy working alone, so we had to wait a while for our check since when we first ordered he didn't close us out or ask if we wanted a tab. However he was very friendly and again, the drinks are STRONG! Margaritas are definitely recommended!

Convenient and reasonably priced spot on Pier 39! This review is specifically for their to-go counter which is located right next to the main restaurant. You can't miss it. There wasn't much of a line when I went, and after I ordered, my food was ready in about 5-10 minutes. Also there's plenty of tables around to sit at and eat your food. I got the fish and chips. It was about $10 and came with 3 strips of fried fish and fries. Pretty standard fish and chips- I only wish it came with tartar sauce which is maybe why I didn't enjoy it quite as much. And if you're thirsty and don't want to pay $3 for bottled water (the standard around here), they do provide cups of water for something like 25 cents. This is not a restaurant I would go out of my way for, but it's a nice option if you're exploring Pier 39 and want to grab a quick bite!

The food (we ordered the nachos and some adult beverages) was great and I would eat it again. The portion sizes were great and the prices were reasonable. I had to give this restaurant 3 stars though because our server was a little slow and did not keep our waters refilled. The bathrooms were also pretty gross and didn't look like anyone at the restaurant was taking time to care despite several workers hanging around and talking.

I recommend if you don't wanna wait and wanna grab a quick bite it's better to order to go!I wanted the full experience but didn't wanna wait so long I'm so glad I came to San Francisco to experience different places to eat, I like the atmosphere my type of place to go to ; Laid back and chill

This place is located on the money spot. It will be one of the first restaraunts you'll see when you come to Pier 39.The restaraunt started to get crowded after 6:00 PM. The wait wasn't too bad, only around 10 minutes. We requested to sit inside, but all the tables were taken. Instead of informing us that there were no more tables avalible inside, our hostess continued to chat to his peers and escorted outside. This defintely annoyed my dad.We ordered the clam chowder and comboed it with a salad (you aren't allowed to choose other salads, you are only given the option of a house salad).We also ordered the bbq ribs because $11 for ribs sounded like a dream. The bread bowl was soggy and the clam chowder had barely to none clams! The cilantro-lime vinagrette was so sour, no one even touched the salad. And sadly, the dream was too good to be real. The ribs were small, barely had meat, and the bbq sauce tasted like pure honey.The servers were very busy, so waiting for the bill took around 10 minutes. I wouldn't come here again. Pricey, mediocore food, and slow service, there wasn't much to love

This place was nice. It is at the beginning of the Pier 39. We got there at about 12pm on a Saturday and it was busy however we got seated quickly. The food was reasonable for being on the pier. Surprisingly not overpriced for a tourist area. I ordered the Teriyaki Burger it was about $13 and a 23oz alcoholic beverage for $11. Good portion of food. Definitely filling. Not 5 stars because they took a bit to take our order and didn't really come to the table much. But once we ordered the food was served quick. I would recommend trying this place. Also they validate for parking garage.

OHHH BOY!! I cannot even describe how happy I am with the food and service at Wipeout Bar & Grill!! My boyfriend and I decided to visit Pier 39 and we actually walked all the way from Chinatown to the Pier (IT WAS A LONG WALK, TOOK FOREVER). Needless to say, when I got to the pier, I WAS STARVING!! Although I wanted seafood and a bowl of clam chowder, I decided to visit Wipeout because it was near me and I really couldn't walk any further before I put some food in my belly. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and close to the water, the tables were a little messy though because there were soooo many people! The place was jam packed with people that my boyfriend and I actually had to wait for around 15-20 minutes, which isn't bad. I ordered a strawberry lemonade because I am a lemonade FANATIC! My boyfriend ordered a burger, I forgot the name of the burger but it has avocado on top, bacon, and cheese. I settled on the BBQ chicken pizza and we also ordered the fried calamari. I am sooo sad that I forgot to take a photo of the fried calamari because the plate was HUGE!!! I am a big big fan of fried calamari and when the waiter brought the plate out, I almost fainted, it was pure bliss. I devoured the fried calamari, it was soooo delicious and yummy! When our entrees were brought out, I was already super full because of the calamari hahaha. My boyfriend gobbled up the burger in about 3 seconds, it was VERY TASTY!! The avocado and bacon really made the burger stand out. The BBQ chicken pizza was also REALLY REALLY finger-licking good, I would order both plates again. Overall, you can tell based on my gigantic review that I had a very good time at Wipeout Bar & Grill, and that I will surely be back! I highly reccomend this place people

Very basic fare, as far as American restaurants go. I had a chipotle chicken pasta that wasn't very flavorful. The waiter suggested a Mai Tai that I ended up ordering. I did not like it. It was extremely sweet, almost syrupy. I couldn't drink it. The waiter was very nice and didn't make me pay for it which I was very surprised about. I was disappointed in my lunch but I would go back and maybe order something different. My friend ordered the steak with the blue cheese and that was very good.

When you have a tourist trap area like Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf in the most popular part of San Francisco, one might always assume that food & drink prices are absurdly inflated. Not to mention, some of these restaurants offer only mediocre quality food. Surprisingly, this isn't quite the case with "Wipeout Bar & Grill".As far as getting to this restaurant (located in the heart of Pier 39), it is relatively easy to find as you will see giant wooden posts paired up with palm trees and surfboards, it almost looks like a place that should be in Malibu or Honolulu and not a cool climate like San Francisco. Forget about driving to this place; the parking garage is located a couple blocks away. My advice is to either walk, bike, take a cab, Muni bus, or trolley.This is actually my second time dining here, however it is my first review on the place. I came here with my lady and our friend (who was celebrating her birthday over Labor Day weekend). We arrived around 5:30pm (on the afternoon of Sunday 9/4/16) and were told by the hostess it would be about a 35-minute wait. Unfortunately, this place does not provide the portable buzzers when your table is ready; nor do they text you. Not a big deal but staying near the restaurant hearing for someone to call your name can be challenging, especially since it is very loud inside.And speaking of the inside, you will find a fairly large and spacious dining area complete with a very surf-inspired theme to it. Some of the tables are even carved out as surfboards. And for the serious surf enthusiasts, there is also a chalkboard that lists the daily surf reports as well as shark attack reports. One thing I didn't really care for were the bathrooms. A restaurant this busy only had 3 toilets (with private doors) that are used by men & women while the sink is located outside. That's a bit odd if you ask me. The outside has plenty of seating to dine as well as fire pits for those cold, foggy San Francisco days.Fortunately the wait time was only 20 minutes and we are all seated around 5:50pm. Our hostess (whom I forgot her name) was very friendly and had an awesome personality. We all ordered drinks, I was craving an iced cold beer so I went with a 20 oz. size of the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. To eat, I decided on their "Teriyaki Pineapple Chicken Sandwich" (for $12.95). This consisted of a grilled chicken breast, teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple and jack cheese served on a toasted bun. As my side of choice, I went the healthier route and went with a side salad w/vinaigrette dressing.As busy as this place was, all three of us got our meals out in less than 15 minutes; I find that to be quite impressive. Now onto the food.. I actually enjoyed every bite of my pineapple chicken sandwich. It was flavored very well and was a very generous portion that filled me up very well. My lady ordered their "Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl" and she loved her meal as well. However, our friend (who wasn't that hungry) only went with the "Coconut Fried Shrimp" (which was priced at $10.95) and was not satisfied how small the amount of food was that she got. My entree (that was only a mere $2.00 more) had way more overall food. So it really depends on what you order that determines if you get your moneys worth or not.Overall, "Wipeout Bar & Grill" is a decent place that won't burn a hole in your pocket. They do serve breakfast, a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar & several beers on tap), and finally a decent dessert menu. And speaking of desserts, our friend (the birthday girl) had Happy Birthday sung to her and got complimentary chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. So all in all, its a solid 4-star dining experience, not the best place I've been to but far better than some of the other overpriced touristy restaurants in the area.

First things first; it's Fisherman's Wharf. Are you a SF local? What the hell are you doing here? It's very crowded, very expensive, and lots of tourists really wandering around with paper maps, in circles, with little-to-no spacial or kinesthetic awareness. Your coffee will be knocked out of your hand by a clueless housewife from Nebraska. You'll be annoyed.Met up with a friend who was in town for a conference nearby, and she only had an hour so we were limited to this neighborhood, as much as we were hoping to end up elsewhere. Walked into Wipeout primarily because it wasn't one of the most expensive places in the area... and it was... fine.Food was good but not great. Setting was cute but not sexy. Waiter was helpful but not exceptional. Expensive for fish tacos, but not for Fisherman's Wharf.

I had such a great time here! I went recently and split the Blue Cheese Fries and some wings with my family (I think the wings were also blue cheese? Can't remember, but they were delicious and actually drumettes, which were fantastic anyway.) I'm afraid I can't say what beers were had because I wasn't paying much attention since I was happy with my Angry Orchard, but my brother really favored his and it was Magnolia something, I'm sorry I'm not very helpful but the staff was knowledgable so just ask them, depending on what you like. Although it was not the warmest of San Francisco nights, we sat outside people watched - they have a great little fireplace that kept us warm as well as our drinks! The fries were absolutely fantastic, unlike anything I'd had before, and the combination of green onions, blue cheese, bacon, and the rest of the toppings made it so delicious, couldn't complain. I also want to give props to our waiter Brian, who first off has some really cool tattoos. My parents were deciding between two beers and he offered us the ability to sample them, which was unexpected and delightful, and they came out promptly and were excellent quality. Brian also heard us talking about how it was my father's birthday and brought him a brownie and frozen yogurt, which was quite sweet, so just total applause to him, we really liked him. We also ordered the fries on his recommendation, so thank you Brian. All in all, this place is a good place for people watching, drinks, food, and service without being ridiculously expensive or feeling too much like a tourist! The restaurant's theme was beachey and Californian without being raunchy, and had enjoyable music as well. I'd recommend!

Wipeout is exactly what you would expect it to be when you look at it. A very mediocre, touristy restaurant with very high prices and very average quality. I went to Pier 39 because I was with my wife who had never been to Sam Francisco. After walking around for almost an hour, we finally decided to eat here. The beer list is maybe the best thing here. My burger had very little in the way of flavor. My wife's calamari was very salty. The fries were just average. I guess it's what you should expect from the location.

Of all the times we've been to Pier 39 this was our first dinning experience here and we loved everything about this place. We had lunch here on Thanksgiving Day and despite the crowds our server was all over it. We were lucky to get four seats by the fireplace. We chose to order off the menu from there since it was a beautiful day on the wharf. The drinks were great and priced right. I had the Sex on the Baker Beach and a mango margarita. The nachos was a big hit. The clam chowder bread bowls are a must! While the inside is cool, the outside dinning area makes this place stand out among the others. It's close to the front and offers great views. No reservations needed. I highly recommend!

Decided to play tourist today in San Francisco, even though we live here we rarely make it down to Pier 39. My 5lb yorkie named Willie and I decided to walk all the way from market street to Pier 39 by the time we got here we are both slightly famished (yay SF hills!). We noticed that wipeout had outdoor seating (I have dined here previously and have always had a good meal however being with the pup changes things a bit) we decided to give it a go-I've definitely learned that dog friendly restaurants are either a hit or miss - Wipeout nailed it! Our server Kimberly greeted us with a warm welcome and brought out water for Willie! I had the bread bowl salad combo- because who doesn't get clam chowder at Fisherman's Wharf?! Willie had a kids burger which was prepared puppy friendly without even having to request it! We both enjoyed our lunch and will definitely be visiting again. Thank you Wipeout and your kind staff for making Willies day out great!

Pizza was great, although the salad was brown and bitter and so being on the side of the water seems pretty ridiculous.

Attended the Spring Wine Pour at Pier 39 and was waiting for someone to join our party. Spotted this restaurant as it is one of the first ones you see at the entrance to the pier. Decided to grab a drink with a friend while waiting.Was greeted (or not) by an un-smiling hostess. Asked if there was some room at the bar for 2. There wasn't, so we were seated on the patio where at least we could watch the passerby. We were handed our menus and didn't get approached for another 15 minutes. Finally placed our order for 2 drinks and the Bacon Blue Cheese Fries. Asked to close out immediately after as we were sort of on a time crunch. Food and drinks took literally forever to come out. And each time the person bringing whatever over seemed confused or lost. With both the drinks and fries, the server walked by us, looked around with a puzzled look on his/her face, and then finally set down whatever they had at our table. Drinks were extremely watered down, tasted as if they put a teaspoon of alcohol in it. The french fries, however, were very good, as I had never had fries with blue cheese and I LOVE blue cheese. Also, despite the fact that we asked for the bill immediately after ordering, that took another 15 minutes to get to us. And then another 15 to receive the copies to sign. We were also not checked on once. Overall, fries were good, drinks were watery, and service was just a no. Will most likely never come back.

The place is packed with people and waiters are rushing in and out. They served us Hawaiian pizza, garlic pizza bread, fish and chips, though I think their garlic fries were the best. The restrooms were so confusing! I saw a male coming out of the restrooms and there were no signs, so I just awkwardly stood outside the door! The waiters were nice to us. I must admit though, this place is quite pricey for dishes that are not particularly spectacular or unique. Nonetheless, it's a great place to eat while touring!

This was a fun place to have lunch. Extremely busy during lunch hour and they have all your standard Fisherman's Wharf favorites such as clam chowder in a bread bowl, but with the added benefit of some Mexican dishes. A little overpriced but that was expected since it's San Francisco. They have one large co-ed bathroom which I thought was oh so progressive; So if that makes you uncomfortable in your private parts, then use the facilities elsewhere.

We specifically wanted chowder and it was raining. We went in here because of the large options of food for our big group. Food was ok. Nothing to call home about. I had the tuna bowl. The fish was so so but the coconut rice was great. I wouldn't come here on purpose again

On Pier 39 on Fishermans Wharf in SAN Francisco. We had breakfast here several times during our recent SAN Fran vacation. Their specialty is sourdough pancakes and WOW are they good!! Great sourdough flavor and a very tender pancake. Hubby had scrambled eggs and their own brand of hot sauce- which he liked enough to bring a bottle home to Iowa! The view looks right out to the ocean and the atmosphere is fun and beachy.

Mmm, yeah ... this place was just okay. Fisherman's Wharf is super busy and filled with tourists. With so many places to choose from we decided to give this one a shot. The spot is fun and has the quintessential beach theme to it. Our server was very nice and attentive.The food, however, was forgettable.I ordered the salmon BLT that looked appetizing. Too bad there was barely any mayo on it, making the salmon taste drier than it already did. (Points for adding a nice portion of lettuce, so I could get some green in.) My husband did say he enjoyed his fish tacos.The biggest disappointment came with our kids' order. The chicken tenders they got were so hard and over-cooked, I'm pretty sure the sea life wouldn't dare touch them. You could barely pull pieces of edible meat from each tender. Needless to say, our kids ended up eating our food.Like others commenting, it took a while to get our food and for the waitress to come back with check. I will say the waitress (likely a grandmother) did an awesome job of splitting up our kids' single meal on two plates, and bringing out their food before ours.Maybe this place had an off day. We won't be returning to find out. I guess I should've looked at all the three star reviews before picking this place.

Decent food. Nothing too special. The basic calamari and chips, fish and chips combos. Order to go on the side and you can get a nice size order of calamari and chips for $7.50. Which is a good price in an area where a hotdog could run you $5.50 plus tax. The calamari rings could use a squeeze of lemon to add some tang to them. But they were just ok. If you choose to dine in, the price doubles on the menu. Which is why we decided to just grab to go, eat in the designated area for to go food and head off to see the rest of the pier.

I wanted to like wipeout. I really did. The atmosphere seemed promising. We had a small group - 4 adults and two children. The surface of our table smelled like it had been wiped with a mildewed, food covered rag. The condiments (ketchup AND mustard) were totally rancid. Water glasses had food remnants on the rims. Silverware was still dirty as well.Service was incredibly slow. My children were never served their own drinks (that we ordered!) and we sat for 10 minutes after receiving our food for an employee to walk by for us to ask for silverware. Overall this place was a complete and total letdown. I am bewildered that this establishment has passed any health code inspections at all.we most certainly will NOT be returning.

I had some relatives visiting and we were up in San Francisco at the Fisherman's Wharf. We started to get hungry and everywhere had a really long wait. So we decided to eat here since the wait wasn't too long and they had a bar so that was perfect.This place isn't terrible, but it isn't outstanding either. The service was quite slow, even though they were pretty busy. However, we asked them for waters, but we didn't receive them til after out food came out, which also took a really long time. The server was not sympathetic, but it could have been because she was busy.I ended up ordering a Corona-rita (Corona beer with a margarita) and a half salad half clam chowder. The Corona-rita was pretty good. I have had it before at other places and this one wasn't as sweet, which I liked. Most places put too much sweet and sour and its like drinking sweet tarts. Yuck! The salad on the side was pretty lame, literally nothing special about it. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was ok, just like the rest of the meal, nothing special and a little bland.The rest of my family ended up ordering some pretty yummy looking things. Next time I will try the burgers or sandwiches.

Located in Pier 39, Wipe out is a quite busy bar&grill place however lines moves fast. We had a late lunch before our sailing tour. Menus arrived as soon as we sat down and the waitress took the order within the following minutes.We ordered a clam chowder soup in a sour dough bread bowl and a salmon salad. The soup is really nice, you feel the sour dough taste of the bread. We ate the whole bowl with the salad :) Salad lacks dressing, salmon was a small piece, a bit overcooked. Being busy, I assume they pre-cook and reheat that should be the reason why.Bathrooms are unisex but super clean. Considering the crowd, it is a good job.Tables by the window have pier view.

I probably will never order a fish sandwich or burger here ever again! Of course it's apart of the attraction and it's reasonably priced for the pier but my whole entire bun fell apart or crumbled. Although the fish inside was crispy and moist and my garlic fries were amazing the bun on my sandwich and my moms burger was done from the start. Her patty also had no flavor... good luck!!

The place was really was busy due to the fact it's on the pier. Customer service was good, our server was able to make a special change for my meal which was 2 tacos 1 fish and 1 shrimp and rice and beans.The Shrimp taco was pretty good, the fish however was a little under seasoned, but the sauce it came with made it taste a bit more tasty. The rice and beans had a certain taste I couldn't quite put my taste buds on.The Raspberry Tea was absolutely DELICIOUS! I should've ordered one to go. The calamari was on the tasty side as well, my colleague ordered the calamari and fries, the other had Salmon with veggies. I must admit that the veggies were cooked to the appropriate texture and seasoned delectably well!.I would consider going back, but definitely ordering something different.

Happened to find ourselves on Pier 39 and decided to grab dinner here. Crowded and Touristy, but we tried it anyhow. The service was good and I ordered the Skirt Steak. It had great flavor but was also the toughest piece of meat I've had in a long time, like trying to eat my flip flop tough. Wifey had the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl that was very good. The Garlic Fries were good. Not a bad place, but doubtful we'll be back.

Mediocre, at best. My nephew and I were in SF for a weekend & stopped here for lunch before touring Alcatraz. He ordered the cheeseburger (he wished we just went to In 'n Out down the road, instead). I ordered the pineapple teriyaki chicken sandwich. The teriyaki sauce was too sweet & not flavorful. The chicken was cooked well, but only flavored by the pineapple slice, which was probably the only tasty part of the meal. We both had the fries, which tasted like they came right out of an Ore Ida bag. Gross.service was friendly and pretty quick, for this New Yorker's patience!Definitely take a longer walk through Pier 39, to find someplace else, or take a walk to In 'n Out (if you're burger-bound & have the time).

Terrible service. Overpriced. Food was brought out cold and I know I mentioned that the service was terrible. Let me just reiterate. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE! Water was not brought out while waiting for our food. Not to mention the server forgot two of our orders for my niece and nephew. Mac and cheese was brought out cold. If it was cold why bring it out? It's common sense. This place deserves no stars.

Wilfredo was our server and I highly recommend him. Very attentive and willing to help with general questions about the area despite how busy the restaurant was. Food was good too but the service (for our server at least) was top notch! They even have charging stations too. Just ask your server :)

Generic seafood chain restaurant on San Francisco's kitschy Fishermans Wharf delivers decent food, good service, and a family-friendly atmosphere. I'm a foodie. So, maybe it's unfair for me to review a place like this. I have no real complaints about the Wipeout Grille, but there's nothing local or special about it either. I could be in Galveston, Pensacola, or Virginia Beach and find a restaurant that would be indistinguishable from it except for the color scheme. The menu is long on choices and short on interest: burgers, nachos, pizza, tacos, generically Asian bowls, salads, sandwiches, and sea food all in one place. The margaritas are large and nicely priced. The beer is lowest common denominator. Our server, Jana, was attentive and helpful. The decor was predictably fishy. The bathrooms were oddly unisex (toilets are private, with a shared wash area). Not a big deal, but I saw women in the line the first time and had that flash of terror a man has when he accidentally walks in the ladies room. I think I wanted something more distinctly west coast than I found here. We wandered in cuz we were really hungry and tired and it was near the entrance to the wharf. Four stars because they do a good job at being this kind of place. It's just not for a foodie like me.

We went to the Fisherman's wharf on Christmas eve and were looking for places to eat as it was getting late and were hungry...Most of the places were closed and this place had some decent options...so we went in..they said it would be 45min wait...so we put down our name and were waiting...After more than 45 mins we saw that several tables were empty and the waiters were just standing there...so I went to them and mentioned that we have been waiting for a table..the waiters spoke amongst themselves and told me they will go check...we kept waiting but few groups who cane after us got called..so I went up again and asked and the waitress again said she will check...finally after waiting for almost an hour we got a table and we sat there for about 15mins before our waiter showed up...very hungry we ordered appetizers and entrees together...We saw the table behind us get some appetizers before us even though they came later and we didnt even get drinks 30 mins after ordering... We asked the waitress she said she would go back and check..we asked her to at least get our appetizers......after 10mins she came back with our appetizers and she said she was waiting to brink all the orders together...we ordered nachos which apparently had been sitting there so we asked her to get us new ones...After all this experience..though my burger and my wife's pizza and my friend's entrees were OK we left disappointed since we had to wait almost 2 hrs to eat something though the tables..the food and everything was ready....One possible break this place could get was that it was Christmas eve where everything is closed and the staff was tired...Anyway go here on a non-busy day and u will enjoy the food and drinks..dont expect stellar service though :)

Ordered from the to-go area. Definitely waited more than 10 minutes for my calamari and chips platter. The calamari was mediocre. Seasoning was alright. There was a lot of breading around the squid, but the squid was not scare. There was a hefty bite of squid in each piece and they did not go easy on the fries. Overall a decent amount of food for the price you pay (~$7) at a tourist location.

Stopped in for a quick drink and lunch while at the peir. The dining room was festive and made for a good atmosphere for lunch. The outside view from our table was great also. We had fried pickles and a pepperoni pizza. The dipping sauce for the fried pickles was amazing! I ended up doing my pizza slices in it as well!!Good vibes overall. Worth stopping in.
