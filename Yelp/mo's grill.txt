So-so service, so-so breakfast. It was far from busy when we went in and it still took them a remarkably long time to pay attention to us and seat us. Like not even a "hey I'll be with you in a sec" or anything. And it's a small place and there were so many open tables. Two servers seemed not to be able to decide which one was getting our table so we were getting weird duplicate service like "are you ready to order?" Twice in two minutes. Like no we weren't a second ago and we still aren't.The french toast I ordered was yummy and super cinnamon-y but came out pretty room temp. Meh. California omelette was above average. Solid breakfast potatoes. The only bathroom had an out of order sign and when we asked she said it wasn't really it was just running slow and they didn't want people to use it...awk. It was fine.

As a traveler, reasonably priced meals are a must. You won't spend more than $18/person for a full and delicious meal. I ventured to Mo's in need of a good burger but I had a taste for pancakes. Unfortunately, they don't serve breakfast all day but that's no biggie. I order the bacon burger with fries and it was amazing, even without condiments.I came here post-lunch hour and was able to seat myself at the counter. Service was fast. Food was great.Only negative was the single unit bathroom.

I wish I included something in my picture that would show the sheer size of that breakfast burrito. It was HUGE! About the length of my forearm, jam packed full of stuff And covered in chili. I should have read the description a little more closely because I wasn't expecting the chili at all, but now I see the menu does say it's topped with chili. The innards were ridiculous as well, full of sausage, roast pork, ham, potatoes, and eggs. It was really good and enough food for three people. Very reasonably priced at around $10.The restaurant is pretty small, but our group of 7 was seated quickly. It was pretty busy even for a Monday morning! Service was very nice as well. I want to come back to try the burgers!

Saturday night, 830PM, got a table but then moved to the counter to hang with some friends. Got the Veggie burger and that comes fresh grilled onions, the standard toppings, and a fresh made bun! All food is cooked to order by hand. The burger itself was filling and really good! This place is medium sized and cozy. I hear the fries and milkshakes are worth the wait. Cool burger joint in North beach. Go to Mos!

It was my last day In San Fran and I had to get some food in my stomach due to a hangover. There's hundreds of places in SF and I chose this place, I don't regret it whatsoever. The line was kind of long and they don't have a host so you just have to wait until by the door for people to leave when trying to get a table. The food was great, I got the meat breakfast burrito, not realizing how freakin huge it would be I barely ate half of it. However I didn't realize the burrito had 3 types of meat on the burrito, it was still great. Service was great for such a small place. When I came in they were really busy and they did a good job tending my table.

Popped in after we waited at a cash only spot and were pleasantly supieses by the Salmon Lox on a bagel and a veggie omelette. The highlight here is definitely their potatoes. They are crunchy and packed with flavor! Filled us up until dinner.

So when they say rare, they mean RARE. This is the first time I've ordered something rare and actually gotten a burger where I felt slightly uncomfortable eating it. I've gotten in the habit of ordering very rare meat just to get something that is to my liking - a little pink in the middle. If you're like me, readjust your request to accommodate the rareness of their meat here. Otherwise, its standard diner food and its great! Service is great too!

My journey through the side streets of my adopted hometown continues and today featured Mo's Grill.This being my first visit to Mo's demanded my ordering their 'Best Burger', extra crispy fries, please.I was not at all disappointed by Mo's burger and fries combination. The meat was nicely prepared and very moist. Bun was as advertised: toasted on the outside, soft in the middle. Tomato and lettuce accompaniments were fresh and crisp.All in all, a great burger and fries experience served up by willing staff. I will return.

MO's have been a neighborhood favorite for as long as I was a kid. They're burgers are still good. But over time their hamburger patty are getting smaller. They use to fill up the whole bun and now they barley do. The burgers prices are expensive but I use to get what I pay for. Now I don't. They also took the pickle out. That is the best part. I would not recommend it if you are trying to get full. Because that does not happen to me anymore. This is the last time I will be coming here to eat.

My boyfriend and I were about three hours early to our Alcatraz ferry, so we decided to look around for a brunch place. After remembering that we had just graduated from college and that we are poor, we decided to travel away from all of the fancy restaurants near the piers and to the closest inexpensive diner.After walking up 400 stairs and trying to repeatedly break up with my boyfriend for making me exercise and not letting me call an Uber to the restaurant and who had suggested we walk there "in the name of fitness", we finally arrived at Mo's.At this point, I was no happy camper. I just had to exercise, which only happens about once every five years, and on top of that it was noon and we hadn't even had breakfast yet (and I require a full meal at least once an hour).Mo's is not fancy. The people who eat there are regular people, and not people who take pictures of their food #fortheInsta and wear cute outfits solely because they're about to eat brunch. I am a fan of places like Mo's. Mo's has character, and characters eat at Mo's. My boyfriend and I started our breakfast with an appetizer of french fries. "Are you sure?" the waitress asked. "Both of your meals come with potatoes". I assured her that we knew what we were doing, and then I ordered an eggs Benedict and my boyfriend ordered a breakfast burrito. The waitress looked concerned. She had never seen me eat before.The french fries arrived and they were, in two words- "the best". You know when you're eating with someone else and you try to push some of it over to their side of the plate to make sure you both have an equal amount? Or when you get to the last piece and you offer it to the other person out of politeness?Forget it. Not today. Not these fries. These fries were the BEST. These fries would have made weekend mornings in college a whole lot easier. I was about to order another plate of them, but my boyfriend who made me exercise reminded me that our other food was coming.Our entrees arrived and they were just as satisfying as the fries. My eggs benedict was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of eggs Benedict in my life- so trust me, I've had a bad eggs Benedict before. This was not that. This was GOOD. Very good.The most confusing moment of the day was when I took a bite of my boyfriend's breakfast burrito. It was covered in chili. Every flavor in the world was in that burrito. I can't even really describe what it tasted like, because it had so many flavors that I can't even narrow it. That being said, it was definitely not bad. Not as great as the fries, but definitely not bad. If you haven't eaten for many days, or if you've just completed three classes at of SoulCycle and you're rethinking the whole "skinny" thing, this is the burrito for you.To conclude- I'll be back for you, Mo's. I'll never forget your fries. You are one in a million.

Tiny little establishment, but packed full of goodness. Decided to explore SF for the day and got hungry around lunch time. Went on to Yelp and found out that Mo's Grill was near by and thought we'd give it a try! The place was small so there was a bit of a wait - about 20-25 minutes for us, which wasn't too bad. Watching the cooks was pretty entertaining and there was so much on the walls to look at. When we finally got seated, our waitress was very friendly and made sure we got waters right away. I decided on a cheeseburger and the boyfriend got an eggs Benedict. His portion, in my opinion, was a little small, but he loved it.My burger was huge, juicy, and quite delicious! It was cooked perfectly medium, like I asked. One of the best burgers I've ever had. I added a cup of chili on the side and it was great as well. My portions were so generous, I couldn't even finish it all. Our waitress came by to make sure everything was good and to refill our waters on multiple occasions. I definitely recommend this place for a great burger.

I ordered eggs and potatoes! Best potatoes I've ever had. They're boiled and then grilled. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We also ordered a Cesar salad. It was as if we were in Rome with Cesar himself! The chicken was nice and tender with a little bit crispiness! Great ambiance and we got out food in less than 10 minutes. I'll be coming back soon.

Unimpressed but not terrible. I would think any place that can afford rent in San Francisco has to be doing a good job with food. I don't expect the best service but I do expect good food. I had the "really good" or "really great" salad I forgot the name because we were making fun of it so much it was the "really alright" salad in my mind. And they served stale fries. The service was rude.

We were in the area and starving and couldn't find a good a good place for tacos so we ended up here. They have a very decent selection of burgers and I got the Belly Buster Burger with cheese, sauteed mushrooms & caramelized onions. When I got the burger, everything was overflowing out of the burger bun. The burger was huge! I added all the veggies (cept the raw onions), took a bite and even though the insides were spilling everywhere, it was so worth stuffing it back in the bun every time I took a bite. The burger patty was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, the caramelized onions and mushrooms were delicious and all in all, it made the perfect combination of a burger.Overall, totally recommend. Considering how big the burger was, I was surprised I ate it all - veggies and everything!

There's a reason I keep coming back to Mo's (I'm the Duke, what up) and it's definitely not for the murals. Food: Delicious, fresh, huge portions - burritos bigger than Chipotle'sService: Friendly, attentive - I've never had to ask for water/coffeeWait: Not bad - Longest I've waited is ~20 mins for lunch on SaturdayMural: It seems tasteful and fun until you realize a cow is teaching kiddy cows that Mo's has the best burgersI've only been here for breakfast/brunch. All the omelettes are great, the breakfast burrito is heavy but delicious, and the burger is solid. I'll probably be coming here until I can no longer eat solid foods.

I came here for brunch after refusing to wait in line at Mama's. It was a Tuesday at around 11am and the place had only a fraction of the tables filled. The one waitress quickly acknowledged us and sat us at a table. The atmosphere reminds me of a cross between a trendy and a dive diner. There's no frills, but the diner still had a great vibe to it.I decided to get the breakfast burrito with meat (there was also a vegetarian breakfast burrito option). This dish was MASSIVE. The burrito was bursting with peppers, onions, chorizo, and pulled pork. The entire burrito was drenched in a deliciously spicy chili. Topped with a little cheese and sour cream I was in heaven.My friend decided to get the egg's benedict which were also extremely good. The hollandaise sauce was probably one of the creamiest I have ever had. The biggest turn off was that it was definitely over-powered by a strong taste of vinegar, but still it was extremely good.In SF the outrageous price of food can at times be off-putting, however, Mo's portions greatly made up for the price. I finished no more than 2/3 of my burrito and was full for most of the day. The total for our two dishes and two coffees was no more than 25-30 dollars. The reasons why I only have Mo's 4 stars is because the hollandaise was vinegary. But more importantly they do not serve iced coffee, but rather pour hot coffee over ice - which essentially becomes coffee flavored water. All that being said, I would highly recommend this for anyone that wants brunch.

Mo's grill is a great find! I layover in San Francisco for work and come to MO's every time! Their burgers and their breakfasts are amazing...reasonably priced and you get a ton of food! Today I had the bacon, tomato, avocado omelette and it was delicious and massive! Served with phenomenal tasting homefries, two slices of toast and a slice of grapefruit it was the perfect way to start the day! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious food at a great price! Also the farthest thing from a tourist trap which is a huge plus!!

We came here for brunch Saturday of Pride weekend and I was prepped for a long wait. We lucked out between large groups and were seated almost immediately.The coffee was awesome. I didn't need to put sugar in it (it was mild and earthy) and I totally wanted to live in it. I ordered the two eggs over medium with chicken apple sausage and potatoes with sourdough toast. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Best eggs I've had in a long time. Everything else was terrific too. My hubs ordered the BLTA and said it was the best one he has had in a long time. The bacon was perfectly cooked, ratio of sandwich components was perfect. Sometimes it's really hard to get simple right. This place absolutely gets it right.

This little joint makes an awesome burger!Little North Beach favorite with big flavor. All of their burgers look very complex and multidimensional which is always a plus, especially since so many places just have a traditional cheeseburger.

Need a hefty omelette for breakfast? Starving for a juicy burger for lunch? Want to have a salad with grilled chicken breast for dinner? Or maybe you just woke up on a lazy weekend and want to have brunch? No worries! Mo's has got your medicine! To be honest I love their omelettes and burgers so much that I rarely try anything else, but when I do, I am not disappointed.They grind their own meat right there, so you know it is not full of junk meat! The potatoes too are peeled and prepared for French fries and home fries right there, and that makes both items extra good.They get their coffee beans from Graffeo which is a local North Beach coffee roasting company.

You would think with all the Italian eateries in North Beach that Jamie W. and I wouldn't waste our precious time in a burger spot. But you don't know us, so stop judging us on our proletarian appetites. Oh sure, we could have had tourist-priced pasta and pizza, but we were feeling cheap on a Friday and went with Mo's. We had been to the one at Yerba Buena a few times before they changed ownership. It was pretty good though nothing to get Guy Fieri off the hook and on the bus to Flavor Town. Nope and that was fine by us since Mo's didn't require much of a wait for their food.Most of the appeal in eating here was not mingling in the cesspool of douche maximus at most every other place in North Beach, packs of drunken youth who represent the future of our country by blocking the sidewalks. It didn't take us long to order from Mo's standard, all-American menu selection (photo: bit.ly/1CNlbKw). Jamie went tor the $7.50 Best Burger medium and straight-up and added a $2.75 bowl of Chili which was actually pretty good-size with plenty of shredded cheddar on top waiting to melt (photo: bit.ly/145Yxip). It was indeed Friday, and they were serving Clam Chowder. So naturally I ordered a $5 bowl as my starter (photo: bit.ly/1Abs71M).For my main event, I had the $9 Mushroom Burger which had a paltry topping of sauteed mushrooms and some hint of truffle oil according to the menu description (photo: bit.ly/1BehtW4). I decided to have the $2.75 side of Spring Mix Salad to alleviate my conscience about eating all that dairy and meat (photo: bit.ly/1CNl15X). You notice the paucity of adjectives in my review as the food was adequate and little more. Service wasn't particularly warm in here either. If I ever do see this place on Triple-D, I'll know someone's palm was greased because mine certainly was...with real grease. See?FOOD - 3 stars...middling North Beach burger barely satisfied and fell out of my memory quicklyAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...just a Mel's kind of set-upSERVICE - 2 stars...she came and she wentTOTAL - 3 stars...if the douches get you down, you can sneak in here but don't get your hopes up because the bus already left for Flavor Town

You know that character Stan from the cartoon South Park who throws up every time he sees Wendy?That's how I feel as I sit across from Blue Eyes right now.I'm praying for an earthquake, or a freeze ray. Something that would stop this moment, or at least delay it, so I can sit here for hours and never leave.While I take a picture of my breakfast Blue Eyes asks me about Yelp, and if we can connect as Yelp friends. Based on the personal nature of my reviews, and my feelings, I would sooner jump out of a plane without a parachute than be Yelp friends and admit my feelings.I was tempted to order a burger but didn't want to scare Blue Eyes into thinking I'm a pig or a nut job for ordering a burger at 10:30am. So I did the sensible thing, and ordered a traditional breakfast.Then, I calmly tell myself that we're just two people having breakfast, and I try not to get myself all worked up.Like I was in the presence of Angelina Jolie or something.I keep telling myself to slow down when I speak. To chew thoroughly so that I don't choke. To not ask Blue Eyes anything too personal. I keep telling myself to make the most of this, since this moment will never probably never happen again since Blue Eyes is already in a relationship, and even if Blue Eyes was single, would never chose me anyways based on the limited info that I know.We don't seem to have anything in common.I concentrate on the food, as not to stare too much; the potatoes here are tasty, and the scrambled eggs are fluffy, and I ordered coffee (which tasted fresh) which I probably didn't need since I'm wide awake.In fact I haven't felt so alive in years.While staring at Blue Eyes my mind wanders. I think maybe I could get into the hippie loving Berkeley shows, the yoga, the whatever, and mold myself into being whatever Blue Eyes wants.Then, I snap back into reality as the check comes.I shouldn't have to be anybody except myself, even if I am like Stan Marsh from South Park. Blue Eyes should like me for me, I think as we wrap up our meal and head out the door, but all I have is my sense of humor, some dough, and my sense of style.

Fantastic chocolate chip pancakes will knock your socks off and comfort your stomach pleasantly. Hungover? Order a tasty California omelette, adorned with perfectly roasted red-skinned potatoes and topped with half an avocado filled with omega fatty acids. Pair with a light, refreshing, fresh-squeezed orange juice and you will be well on your way to a hangover cure. There are plenty of tables for parties of four, but I suggest you come early before the noon lunch hour rush. This is a great date place, or even a place to eat alone at the sit-in bar.

I lived in the area for over 15 years and never knew of this place until I moved away. Their portions are HUGE. I came here several times for dinner with some friends and always would like to come here again if I was in the area and craving for some burgers. I like how they charge you a lot but give you a big portion versus higher end restaurant that gives you a small portion and charge you a lot. I came here last week because I work semi close and got off work super late and this was one of the few places that was still open. Was about to go to King of Thai but so glad we spot this place instead. Too bad parking really sucks at north beach, otherwise, I'll be able to dine in more often. I ordered a Volcano Burger (Best Burger with Sharp Cheddar Cheese, topped with Smoked Ham, melted Swiss Cheese, and Chipotle Mayonnaise) to go. I also added mushroom in the burger since it didn't come with it. The wait was not long since there weren't too many customers at such a late hour on a weekday. Everything came out fast and hot. My burger cost me a little over $17.The only down side about ordering to go is really the bun. It got super soggy, but still tasty though. The patty was cooked medium and it was juicy, not a bit dry. All the ingredients blend in well together. Got fries as well. Those taste fresh, not as good as Mcdonalds though, but most definitely healthier.

A must try for any Burger Lover!! Have been coming to this place for years and the quality and taste has stayed consistent. The burgers here range from $7-12 bucks not including fries. I've tried almost every burger on this list, but my favorite has to be the French Burger, which is great if you love goat cheese. The Tex-mex is delicious if you like fork/knife burgers topped with delicious chili. As an added bonus, give their apple pie milkshake a try, its a whole piece of apple pie blended into a milkshake. Not a bad addition to satisfy that sweet tooth.

We woke up at the ass crack of dawn to get on the stand-by line for Alcatraz tickets and were lucky enough to make it on time with just a few more people getting on behind us. Phew. After securing mid-morning tickets to the prison, we were ready for a nice hearty breakfast. So I'd never been to the North Beach neighborhood. I yelped it and Mama's came up first. I was like, "hey guys there's a popular place with really good reviews and it's close. let's go there" so we drive around to Mama's on Washington Square and approach this huge gigantic enormous line. In my head, I'm like what could people possibly waiting for in line this early that's not Alcatraz on Sunday morning?? It was Mama's!!!! WHAT? Well good riddance. BYE.THEN. We walk over to Brioche Bakery and Cafe and walk right out because they don't serve the REAL breakfast until 9am. BYE.*Enter Mo's Grill - Review Actually Begins Here*By this time I'm really hungry. I see potatoes twirling in the front window on these huge pans and get really excited. They fill up your coffee after every sip you take. The restaurant had just opened and already filled up quickly. This place has lots of regulars and tourists.I ordered two eggs over easy, with the breakfast potatoes, and an english muffin. After some deliberation, my friend and I decided to split a plate of the pancakes. I couldn't leave without trying them. The potatoes were honestly some of the best potatoes I've ever had - nicely browned and crispy but soft when it mattered. My eggs were perfectly runny. The pancakes were amazing, a little dense and super filling, and more cake-like than usual. Delicious. The plates are pricey, but I'm finally starting to accept that this is SF and I can't avoid it. I'm from Jersey. The holy mecca of diners and 24 hour breakfast food. Go Mo's! I'm impressed. How much better can Mama's really be? Not willing to wait a million hours to find out. Go to Mo's instead.

Hoowee! Where do I begin? If you like gigantic servings. You found it. If you want more than decent breakfast. You found it. This spot here is the best place for BIG BREAKFASTS. the staff is very flexible with your orders, you get you food pretty timely, and their menu is awesome!!If you go here never miss these two things:1. APPLE PIE MILK SHAKE (extra apple pie) 2. EGGS BENEDICT (add bacon & avocados) If there was anything concerning I would say:1. Parking is a challenge (it's in SF, what did you expect) 2. The street leading to the restaurant is not that sanitary, odor is bad (but once you enter the grill you are welcomed with the smell of breakfast heaven) HECK YEAH I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE

Tasty food and cheerful service make the evening pleasant. Try the Apple Pie, warm with vanilla ice cream makes for a great dessert after a burger or a salad.I tried the chicken skewers with pita bread and the meat was soft and well cooked, as the bread. The fresh salad on top makes for a complete dish.

Nice little hole in the wall. I'm a vegetarian so my options were very limited to 2 different sandwiches, but then the server informed me that I could get any burger with their garden patty. Let me tell you about their garden patty, it is AMAZING and you can tell it's fresh and not frozen like most other places. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area and want to avoid chain restaurants.

Good experience. One of the few places that was open on thanksgiving and we enjoyed our visit. Went in for late lunch/early dinner. I was intoxicated and I think if I had a piece of rock I would have loved it, but everybody else at the table was complementary of their burgers so I think they did it right. Chilli cheese fries, yum. Kitchen is right in front of you so you can see them as they make your food.

I don't have a long story to tell but plain and simply this is the best burger I have ever eaten. Not only the burger but the fries are thin and crisped to absolute perfection. Cooked over volcanic rock on display in the window for people passing by to salivate. Do yourself a favor and order a burger from Mo's!

Upon walking into Mo's, I witnessed the "chef", in plain view, make a hamburger patty with his bare hands and proceed to plate bread afterwards without washing. I should of left at that point, but decided to give it a shot based on its Yelp reviews.I ordered an egg sandwich with cheese and bacon, which was served to me soggy and cold. When my friend and I were done we asked for separate checks but were given one. When we went to pay, we handed the cashier two cards and told they have a 1 card policy. Come on, it's 2016.

I first want to start by saying my review is not about the food per say the food was decent maybe a 3 star just because of the potatoes. However Mo's does not deserve a 4 star and I want to warn people about the deceitful rating. I watched a chef prepare a raw beef patty by hand right in plain view with no gloves, and then proceed to handle bread with out washing his hands. Which Is just plain careless. The service was also sub par the servers are rushing and really have no customers service care at all. And last but not least when I went to pay we wanted to split our check as I was eating with a friend. They told us that we could only use one card per table and let's be real it's 2016. How is a business in the most tech forward city in the country not on board with full options when it comes to card transactions.

just a few bites from out full review - "We just knew the name of the place - Mo's which was recommended to us by a great local guide from San Francisco Walking Tours - Harley""Best Burger and California Burger were our choices, to be exact. We enjoyed them with Beatles' The White Album rolling in the background.""We were glad to stumble on this recommended place, but we were sad not be finish any of our purchases. Arrive with a big appetite!"

A fabulous breakfast. You definitely can't go wrong. The potatoes, bacon and toast were fantastic. The service was quick and good.

Came here on a double date after fleet week. They have plenty of burger options. My Fiance ended up getting the Western Burger well done with fries on the side. He liked it. It was big and juicy and the fries were just right. I had the Bacon Burger medium well with added on avocado. It was $2 extra for half and avocado. Avocado is expensive and its SF so what else should I expect. My burger was good. I asked for a medium well burger paddy but it was more on the pink side, but that's okay for me. I recommend to just ask for it well done. Good food and good service by Ricardo. He let us move to another table facing the TV because the Giants were playing. Clean space. Decent restroom. No parking.

I ordered the French Burger which was amazing!! I also added bacon. It was messy and huge and so so delicious. The French fries were pretty disappointing, bland and tasted under cooked. Oh well, they weren't the highlight of the meal. I will definitely come back for that burger!!

Just good diner grub. Great portions, friendly service, ALWAYS busy. We got in at a lull, but as soon as we sat down there was a line out the door. A definite place you should check out when your in SF and your craving a 5 pound breakfast burrito!Enjoy!

WOW. Prepare to be stuffed! My husband and I went in starving and left totally beyond stuffed. We ordered the California omelet and the breakfast burrito. The burrito is larger than most premature infants and I, sadly, could not finish everything. It is quite spicy (which we enjoyed)! The California omelet was everything perfect - refreshing and creamy. Great textures on the plate, too. Crunchiness from the toast and potatoes were a plus. Would definitely come back again. Also, we enjoyed the apple pie shake immensely.

I have been here for breakfast a few times and they have delivered a delicious meal for a reasonable price. I have had their ribs for takeout and was impressed.

It's busy, but it's worth the wait. The service was good even though they were swamped. Get the Breakfast burrito. Total gut buster. You won't be able to finish it.

Went to Mo's for breakfast on a Saturday morning. SO GOOD. Lox bagel was fresh and huge. Perfectly plump pancakes were loaded with blueberries. Crispy bacon was a scrumptious side. Mimosa to top it off.As a bonus, if you sit at the bar you can watch the cooks put dishes together as a visual appetizer.Friendly staff, not a bad wait, extremely pleased.
