So I ate at Darren's while visiting S.F. last weekend and ordered Country Fried Steak with a side of hasbrowns and scrambled eggs. The food was tasty, but they were out of O.J.! My friend also wanted sour cream and it wasn't available either.Despite those drawbacks, this is a fine place for breakfast. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, while the cooks whipped up our dishes in a matter of minutes.Overall, Darren's Cafe is priced reasonably well and you can't beat the Fisherman's Wharf location. But the place gets busy so getting a table may be challenging.

You didn't tell me I could get friendly neighborhood service at Fisherman's Wharf. Darren's has been serving up distinct meals since 2007!American style? Yup! The cook keeps the fried eggs white, and the poached eggs are delicious too. You can have a chicken fried steak, or big breakfast sandwiches.Vietnamese style? Charbroiled beef atop the vermicelli noodles and delicious sauces and pho.

Wow! This place is awesome! Hidden gem near fisherman's wharf! Food is really good and service is very attentive, friendly and efficient! Came here for Sunday brunch recently with some friends and I'm thoroughly impressed!! The restaurant is pretty small but super cute. We got a table on the outside patio since the fall weather has been pretty nice lately. The menu is very extensive and they do serve breakfast all day which is the best! The menu has a ton of American fares like pancakes and eggs and bacon but also has a lot of Vietnamese favors like Pho and bahn mi. We ordered a few different items to share and everything was absolutely delicious. Must order their signature satay Pho, the broth is to die for! We also got the pork spring rolls super tasty! The portion size is HUGE and prices are very inexpensive for the city especially for restaurants near Fisherman's Wharf. The V salads were also super authentic and tasted so good.Bathrooms are through the kitchen behind the restaurant. Metered parking in front of the street, wasn't bad on a Sunday late morning. Highly recommend!

I rarely give one star reviews, but unfortunately we had a horrible experience while visiting SF and giving this place a try. It was my husband and I's last day visiting, there were tons of brunch options and we decided to try this place since there was not a line. As soon as we sat down, our server basically threw down menus and asked us what we wanted to drink, he walked off as soon as we said water. We then ordered our meals, I couldn't resist a good bowl of pho, even at 10am. I asked for "no onions, nothing green." At this point we noticed all the other servers were overly friendly to everyone, it was only our server who was incredibly rude. Another nice server brought my pho, and I noticed there were tons of cilantro and green onions in my soup. I must've made a face because the same nice server said "do you not like cilantro?" I replied no, but that I didn't specifically say no cilantro, so I would scoop it out and thanked him. He said "absolutely not, we will fix it!" Thinking how nice that was, 3 seconds later our original rude server brought back my bowl of pho, plopped it in front of me (spilling some) and states "YOU said no onions, this is cilantro, you didn't say no cilantro." Stunned, I just pointed at the nice server and said he insisted on fixing it, at this same time, the nice server came over and under his breath told our server "dude, what are you doing? Just fix it man." Our server refused to take the bowl back. The other servers were even embarrassed by his behavior. I was so stunned and upset, it ruined my entire morning. You work off tips dude, WTF is wrong with you?! The ONLY reason I tipped was because I know they split it and the other people were so nice. Also, his name was "Stan." Those are the kind of servers that ruin your business.

Being from New York, I hate feeling like a tourist. We tried to find some good a little off the beaten path of Fisherman's Wharf.The place has a solid mix of Vietnamese food (noodles and soup) and American food (burgers and fries). Our service was great, we were immediately greeted and given some guidance into their Vietnamese food. We grabbed some Chow Mein and Grilled Cheese and couldn't have been happier.The cheese was melted and the bread was toasted well, the fries came out golden and crispy while the noodles were hot and filled with the extras. We both left full and satisfied, would definitely recommend to others and would definitely return!

Was trying to go to Hollywood cafe but the line was too long so my husband and I decided to go to Darren's. Seating was quick and service was friendly and fast. We both couldn't decide on American breakfast or pho since we do love our pho! The pho is definitely on the pricey side about $11.25 a bowl. It came quick the food was hot but there was barely anything in there. I had had 3 pieces of rare beef and 3 slices of brisket full of fat. My husband barely had any chicken in his chicken pho. We left feeling ripped off , hungry and unsatisfied. Next time, we will try the American breakfast instead.

My husband and I were visiting the Bay and looking for a quick breakfast before doing some site seeing. After checking out one spot just a few blocks away that was on a considerable wait, I checked the reviews and we headed to Darren's. We sat down right away and we're greeted by a waitress. Was it the best breakfast I've ever had? Not even close. Best service? Nope. But the food was decent, the service was prompt, and the price was right.If you're looking for a fancy brunch with eggs benedict and mimosas, don't come here. But if you need a decent breakfast for a good price, this is a good choice.Sorry, I can't speak to the rest of the menu!

My family was visiting from NJ and we wanted to have a good hot brunch. Walked through Fishermans Wharf until this establishment caught my mother in law attention. We had a small Havanese dog with us and it was great that they were pet- friendly. We ordered everything from corn beef with eggs, pho with beef, the chicken /steak combination and all the food was great and served hot. Very quick service and servers were all friendly and professional. Strongly recommend this resto.

I was in the Fisherman's Wharf area and ate brunch at Darren's cafe. It was packed and it was rainy and we were sat at a table right by the door so we got a lot of the bursts of wind every time they door opened and just in general because there was tiny permanent gaps in the windows. Besides that part my girlfriend decided to order two dishes, one Vietnamese and one American breakfast. I ordered the seafood scramble which was decent with shrimp and scallops along with home potatoes and sourdough toast. My girlfriend ordered a Pork Noodle Soup whose broth tasted package and there was very little pork to be seen in the bowl. We knew eating by Fisherman's Wharf that prices would be higher, but we thought expected a little more out of what we ordered.

Came here for our last breakfast in SF! Staff was super nice, we wanted to sit outside, but it was cold so they immediately offered to turn on the heating lamps. The restaurant is located close to the water the street it's on a pretty dead, at least at 11 AM. Anyway, we had an egg white omelet with home fries and the chorizo scramble with hash... both were great! Portions were a bit smaller comparing to Hollywood Cafe, Eight AM, Mama's on Washington etc. But it was def enough... Oh and i LOVED the sourdough toast... yummm... and i normally don't like to waste calories on toasts :)

Darren's Cafe has a solid menu of both American Cafe and Vietnamese style foods. They keep their menu simple without over whelming you with options. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Shrimp Spring Rolls, Beef Pho, Cappuccino and Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Everything was great, fresh, and full of flavors.The service was on point. Our servers were attentive, polite and quick. There isn't any special about the atmosphere other than a simple Cafe style look. It's a smaller place with outdoor seating so I'm assuming this place can get pretty busy. Luckily it wasn't busy when we were here.Overall, hands down, 5 Stars - All Day. In my opinion, a 5 Star rating isn't about an upscale, over priced menu with an ocean view. Even though that might be great and all - 5 Stars is when everything comes together for a perfect experience.

It was ridiculously crowded the doors are left open leaving it uncomfortably cold in the restaurant where I got sat by the door to enjoy the smells of cigarettes and car exhaust going by. My first impression when I saw this place was to just leave and not give this place a second thought. The food doesn't even seem worth it especially for the prices. It's cramped I was constantly getting hit by everyone walking by because everyone is practically on top of each other. They have a substantial amount of work to do on this place and their methods of operation before I would give this place more than one star. Definitely won't come back and definitely won't recommend to anyone.

I was in DTSF meeting up with some friends for lunch. Little did I know that this spot was literally right next to Fisherman's Wharf - super touristy and probably really expensive.Well what do ya know, I was right. I was a bit surprised at first when I saw the menu - it's like a combo of a diner and vietnamese food!!! Pretty interesting and I loved all the options! It was kind of funny for my friend, she had no idea what to order because she wanted whatever their specialty was and apparently its their vietnamese food.I ordered the Q4 (pho) which was the Spicy Satay Beef noodle soup. I really liked how spicy it was initially, but after awhile it got too much to handle that I felt like I was going to get a sore throat .___." And it was a bit disgusting that the jalapenos that came out with the hoisin sauce and bean sprouts were old... Pretty gross.When the bill came out, I didn't realize how expensive the meals were here... It was a bit ridiculous. And it sort of sucks that there's only one size for every soup dish because I know at other vietnamese places the pho bowl sizes vary with the pricing.I don't think I'd come here again because it was also an additional $5 to park, so good luck finding street metered parking =(

Great little Vietnamese place with good food for all. Food - Plenty of vegan offerings on the menu, but I ended up ordering a plain bagel with avocado. It was delicious. I also had a double shot of espresso, which was also good. I was told the pho was both saltier and sweeter than the pho offered by places in Chinatown. Service - Friendly staff! Though I didn't ask any questions during my visit, the staff seemed eager to help with anything we might need.Ambiance - Quaint, clean little cafe space.Would return for traditional Vietnamese dishes!

Clean place with good service. Pho is pretty decent. My only complaint is the cost. It's pretty pricey compared to many other pho places in the city; mind you, it's in a very touristy neighborhood, but come on?... $3.55 for a cup of tea? It's not even a nice cup of brewed oolong. It's a cup of hot water and a 25 cent Lipton tea bag.

Despite their sign saying they close at 3:30pm on Saturday, we got there at 3:09pm and they refused to serve us saying they were closed. That's too bad because we walked quite a ways to get here. But I'm sure if David Kim (the name on their business card) knew this was happening, he'd do something about it. So don't come, they may just feel like not being open. Instead, go to Hollywood Cafe a block away at 530 North Point. It's really good food (4.5 yelp stars) and they're open when they say they're open.

Placed a to-go order. Friend went in to pick it up for me as I was the driver. She checked to ensure full order was in the bag but didn't notice that the soup base for my Beef Pho was chicken instead of beef. I'm now dipping & cooking my rare steak in chicken broth. Yuck! I'm so disappointed. Note to all to-go orders... pull your ordered items out of the bag before you leave the cafe. You might end up with something else you didn't order and not realize it until you get all the way home.

Love this place! Good food and great people. Nothing but good customer service. We came here twice for the pho, which I think could use a little bit more taste and meat in it. That's why it's not 5 star review. It would have been for the rice plate though. We returned for the second time today to try the rice plate for an early lunch. The line was long, but it moved pretty quickly and the rice plate, it was gooooodd! We had the combination of chicken and pork and it hit the spot! And, the servers remember us! What's not to love from a great service and good food?

I was expecting Vietnamese dishes only so I was a bit surprised that it is actually very eclectic cuisine. You'll find on the menu lots of breakfast foods like omelettes and french toast but also burgers, salads and Vietnamese entrees.My party had the seafood pho, charbroiled beef vermicelli bowl and grilled tiger prawns (6). I asked for salads on the side instead of rice.Everything was very good. I wish there had been more than 6 prawns as they tasted great! Also, it was nice to be away from Fisherman's Wharf's craziness. We were able to be seated and served pretty much immediately for lunch during Christmas Holidays.The only point I would improve is probably the service... The staff wasn't super friendly & seemed to be in a rush to get our order. The restaurant wasn't packed either. Anyway, it was still a good experience with fresh foods, I do recommend trying out this place!

I have low expectations for a place that does Vietnamese food and brunch at the same time, but I ordered a beef noodle soup for takeout (with my guilty pleasure of spring rolls on the side) and was pretty pleased with the quality of food.Could have had more meat in my soup though. Spring rolls are bomb dot com here, and the next time I have a Friday hangover and need a bowl of soup to help me get through my 8 to 5, I'll stop by and order pho again.

Been here a hand full times since I started working in the wharf. my favorite is Pho, especially in cold winter, food is more than average and turn over is quick so never waited more than 20min. this restaurant also serves American breakfast, sandwiches. the only reason I gave three stars instead of 4 is because , every time I go there and server come to take order, he/she inform me that their c/c machine is broke so I have to pay cash. I didn't mind for couple times but doing this for more than a month? is the machine so hard to fix? or they intentionally doing this? I would still dine here for Pho in cold days. however, owner should consider about this CASH situation.

Our tour to Muir Woods dropped us off by Fisherman's Wharf around noon, and we were pretty hungry for lunch. This was one of the few places around that wasn't a clear tourist trap, so we decided to check it out. I got the beef meatball pho, boyfriend got a double bacon cheeseburger. I really enjoyed my soup! Broth had a really nice flavor, and they gave a good number of tasty meatballs as well. Boyfriend said the burger was pretty good, though a bit greasy. So might be best to get the single burger for better grease-to-bread ratio, or even to just stick to the Vietnamese food here. Our meals were also each under $12, which I think was a good value for what we got.

I decided to get some breakfast to go here as I had a 9AM tour for Alcatraz Islands. The wait was decent.. maybe about 5 minute from ordering for the food ready to go. I got a pretty standard breakfast I thought, I'm thinking if I come here for lunch instead with pho and other Vietnamese dishes available perhaps my experience would have been more enjoyable.The food I got wasn't bad but wasn't too great either, well also probably given the fact I was just trying to fill my stomach before taking the cruise probably didn't have much time to fully enjoy the meal and I think walking around with the butter already on the french toasts made it more soggy than I wanted by the time I was ready to eat them.Prices were really reasonable though and when I was at the restaurant at 8:15ish the place was already pretty busy, its definitely a very popular place that I'm sure was driven partly of the good reviews it get.The service wasn't anything remarkable as I just ordered take outs so I can't really comment on it. Place is pretty easy to find but seating area isn't very large and while I was waiting it can be hard for the waitress to walk between the tables so its a bit cramped.Next time I'm in the area will definitely have to give their lunch/dinner menus a try.

Pho for breakfast... Yes please. I had the bbq pork pho and my husband had an omelet. Something for everyone. Short walk from the Hyatt and very reasonable priced.

Went here for breakfast about 8:30am Saturday and 7:30am Sunday. Packed on Friday and we sat outside under the heaters. Saturday we got there right as they opened so we were the third table to arrive. I had the florentine Benedict the first day and the eggs were perfectly poached runny sunshine! Fresh spinach and bacon crumbles were awesome. Family both opted for pancakes with eggs and bacon. Bacon nice and crisp. Pancakes light and fluffy. Went back this morning and split an combo 3 egg omelet with hash browns. The veggies were grilled and omelet was awesome. Plenty of food for two people. Sadly they don't serve mimosas. I really want to go back and try the pho that I kept seeing people get. It looked awesome. The prices are VERY reasonable- especially for such high quality. The service is excellent!!! Attentive but not hovering. There are several breakfast choices around here but this place is worth the visit!

Came into Darren's Cafe with my cousin (who is visiting from Vancouver, Canada) and wanted to order pancakes. It came with a choice of meat but all the options are pork base (bacon and sausage). Asked if we could get a piece of toast instead of the meat portion of our meal. The waiter said she would ask the chef and surprisingly she said no. Didn't make any sense due to a piece of bread being a fraction of the price. Came here off a recommendation but I would never recommend this place to anyone.

I would recommend you come here for a cheapish diner breakfast. I say cheap because it is cheap for such a touristy area. Otherwise, not so much. We came for lunch, but they are far less impressive in that arena. I would not recommend the pho. It was average at best. Most people around us were still going for the breakfast and I think the breakfast portions for the price was a much better deal. Food is very basic, average diner food. Which is better for breakfast anyway.

This place is a combination of a neighbor local joint despite being located in a very touristy area. They are a very well oiled machine and service despite being so busy on a Saturday morning was excellent. You don't get an individual server just stop anyone that comes by and they are happy to help. You can get anything from American breakfast to traditional Vietnamese pho in the morning at a great price and the food tasted excellent and came out within 10 mins. The coffee was better than the average diner as well

FIRST AND FOREMOST:Ain't fancy, but it's good.THAT SAID:It's a hidden gem at Pier 39. No tourist facade, no corny SF design motifs, no chowder in sourdough bowls. What they do have is a diverse menu of tasty, well-prepared, reasonably-priced meals. The diverse part is that they're 1/2 Main St. diner and 1/2 Vietnamese kitchen.BETTER STILL:They have the only pho in the neighborhood--and it's very good. In fact, the head chef/owner (Steve, I think, or Dave ... an Asian guy) overheard my order and commented that the combination of flavors (seafood pho, add BBQ pork) seemed unusual but would be pretty tasty. That led to a whole conversation about how carefully they prepare their broth and ingredients. He clearly takes care and has a great deal of pride. IN BRIEF:This part of town is dominated by restaurants that over charge and under deliver. Darren's is a terrific exception. Whether you want a stack of pancakes, a decent burger or a steamy bowl of pho, you can get it, and all at a decent price.

First time here and it's GREAT! Efficient, delicious and friendly! We had the chorizo scramble and the turkey melt on sourdough (it IS San Francisco after all) and it was wonderful. I'm an iced tea snob and the tea was delicious!!! I'm going back tomorrow...

Excellent breakfast. Bacon cooked perfect. Skip the hash browns and get the breakfast potatoes. Two people I was with had the Italian omelette and both said it was the best they ever had.

We had brunch here on Sunday. Very tasteful pho! The chicken in pho could have been a little better if bite sized because we are not so fond of big chunks of it specially in pho. The other breakfast items - toast, omelette, coffee, juice - were great too, country potatoes were unique and nice. The country potatoes were perfectly seasoned and not greasy and hashed as some other places have them. The place was crowded but service was relatively not so slow. Definitely try them if in the fishermans wharf area.

I have a party of 23. We have kids who preferred to eat something else, so once everyone was settled in, the kids got some clam chowder from fisherman's wharf and came back so we could all eat together. Some of us were inside and some of us were sitting at the table outside. The kids sat outside with some adults.But the waitress told us we couldn't eat any outside food here. She said we could have it on the table but we couldn't eat it, even if we were eating here too. So the kids were told they had to eat somewhere else. I thought this was pretty unreasonable since we were giving them so much business. So the kids left, and my baby nephew stayed to eat with his mom. He stayed in his stroller next to the table outside as his mom fed him some soup from elsewhere and left it on the stroller. The server came back and asked, "did my boss approve of this?" with a harsh and nasty tone. The manager said they could give us a bag to put the soup in, but the baby could still not eat it. So just a heads up, don't bring outside food here. As for the food, the noodle soup was flavorless and tasted disgusting. Nobody in our party enjoyed their food. NOBODY. We ordered the pho, fried rice, and fried noodles. What a shame it's one of the only pho places in the area. I'm never coming back here again.

Born and raised in San Francisco, I think of Fisherman's Wharf as a tourist destination with the majority of restaurants below average in quality and overpriced food. The only reason why I venture into the area is to take out of town guests and the occasional act like a tourist day with my daughter.My friend recommended a restaurant called Darren's Cafe for lunch. Thinking it was just a regular place, boy was I wrong. Upon entering, the friendly owner greeted us. It was around 11:00 a.m., full house so we only had to wait a couple of minutes. Cleaning of tables was fast and efficient.My friend and I split a Cheeseburger with bacon and fries and we shared a bowl of Pho soup and Vietnamese spring rolls. What a combination! Cheeseburger was cooked to order and spring rolls and soup made to order. It was tasty and delicious.Surprisingly for San Francisco, there are plenty of on street parking spaces within 2 blocks (park on North Point St.) and it's only $1.25 an hour until 3 p.m. Bring coin change for meter.Even though Darren's Cafe is in Fisherman's Wharf, give it a try, you'll be pleasantly happy. There is a reason why so many locals come here on a daily basis.
