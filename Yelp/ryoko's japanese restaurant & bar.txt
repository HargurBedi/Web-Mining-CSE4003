Tldr - interesting unique sushi with a party atmosphere. This ain't low key or simpleCame here for some late night grub after partaking in some activities with the fellas back at the crib. The place's atmosphere reminded me of chubby noodle - nice EDM and hip hop playing with a live hype DJ overlooking the party. Pretty chill place to hang out and it's a great atmosphere for having some sake bombs or beers with food before going elsewhere.Food itself was cool. There were tons of choices, it was pretty hard to choose. One buddy guy was vegetarian and he had more options than any other sushi place I seen before. Casual atmosphere. There was one couple there on a hella nice date like that dude was wearing a button up shirt and vest and all. They looked a bit out of place compared to erryone else.Mochi ice cream yummy and like cut in to serving portions for sharing! But eat fast bc it'll melt.

This place is like a 2.4/5. It's overpriced. $40 for sushi/sashimi dinners for some of the most basic provisions of fish. Two of the nine pieces of the sushi dinner was the same lean cut of maguro tuna - one of the most underwhelming things ever. If I had to price the fish that was served in both sushi and sashimi plates, the total should not have come out to more than $20 - seriously some of the most inflated prices I've ever had to eat. I've traveled across the country and borders to taste some good quality, freshly served sushi and sashimi and I've got to say Ryoko has just not provided the experience that the current ratings reflect. Ended up paying a little over $100 with tip and tax and I felt slightly ripped off and disappointed. Some of the reviews here claim it is good value -- I say, if you are willing to drop at least $40 for a plate of sushi here, you should take that money and go elsewhere to get a better bang for your buck. I've got to say that the only thing that possibly redeems this place is the tamago and good service. Good tamago nigiri and very warm, friendly, and attentive staff.

Being that I have visited Japan every year since 1997, and have eaten in Tsukiji several times, I feel that I have a very good knowledge of authentic sushi and Japanese cuisine.Ryoko's could not have been a bigger disappointment. The sushi rice was flavorless and some grains were hard. The fried oysters were dry and hard as well and tasted as though they were frozen. A few of the pieces of sushi I actually had were tough on the ends, and the uni was not fresh. It left a bad aftertaste in my mouth that lasted well after leaving the restaurant. This is a place to skip in a city with so many other options.

By no means am I a sushi connoisseur, but I can definitely tell when a sushi bar is lacking in quality. I have no idea how Ryoko's has more than 3 stars. I should've read some of the reviews instead of basing my dinner choice on their pictures.Ryoko's is located downstairs--there is no wait area so everyone is waiting along the stairwell. It's packed, stuffy, and loud. Men's bathroom is downstairs and the women's is upstairs. I found it super tough to even get near the stairwell because there was no where to walk.The wait was about 45 minutes for a party of 6 on a Saturday night. Right off the bat, their menu is comprised of 90% rolls. The only crab they offer is imitation. Basically all of their rolls are imitation CA rolls topped with a few slivers of fish. Portions here were also on the tiny side. I ordered the teriyaki chicken (appetizer) + a side of rice, along with the fried CA roll--both were very standard and average.Our server was friendly throughout the night and was more than accommodating when we asked to split the bill three ways. Only complaint about service is that one of our dishes took forever to come out and it was a simple roll, not a dish from the kitchen.Overall, 1.5 stars - cheap quality for a high price tag.

Very disappointed in this place. Ordered the chirashi, golden gate and 49ers. Asked if the chirashi could be done without ebi or tamago and was told no. When I got the chirashi the pieces looked like I prepared the fish and beleive me, you do not want me to cut up sushi pieces for you. It was all mixed together like a poki bowl, but worst. The other two rolls were meh. The only decent dish was the beef oroshi. Service was pretty bad here, as in we had to remind them at least 2 times to get simple things like more tea, need more wasabi, and for our check. Overall, very disappointed in the items and overpriced for what you get.

Probably a reason this place was our second option when we couldn't get into the Yacht Club up the street. There's a bouncer outside for some reason like a club; wasn't sure why until I walked in and it sounded like Ibiza. I think there's a DJ inside, so it's definitely ear split-tingly loud in there. It's also seemingly in a basement with very few or no windows, so there's nowhere to escape it. Food was not very flavorful, and the chirashi was really disappointing: unevenly cut fish, small amount of rice for the quantity of fish you receive, and unwillingness to modify the order (we asked for no tomago or ebi; I get it if it's mixed in and you can't leave it out, but the eggs and shrimp were literally placed on top, inside the bowl...you can't just not place that on top at the end before you serve it? C'mon man. The rolls were uninspired and not very satisfying. The beef oroshi was the lone highlight; pretty sad when medium rare beef over some generic green salad is the best part of a sushi restaurant meal. You have to remind the staff frequently if you need refills or any other food items; I get it's busy, and I'm patient, but 20 minutes for some wasabi? The place isn't that big. Won't be back, very expensive for what you get, and memorable for the wrong reasons.

Honestly i liked old ryoko better. Now its just too overpriced and becoming too basic. Casual and jazzy atmosphere but price is overly expensive. Might as well go to high end too japanese restruant where you dont have to wait 30-40 mins and that takes reaervation on the weekend.

I've gone here a few times now. As far as San Francisco pricing goes, you can't beat this value. The quality for the price is great! A lot of imitation crab on the menu, however the other fish quality is pretty dang good. There are some great rolls and the nigiri has good cuts of fish. Fair warning... they play REALLY loud music and randomly all the workers yell. So if you're coming here expecting to have a heart to heart convo, it might be tough. Totally worth a visit if you are looking for great sushi but not willing to pay $$$$ for it.

Went here on a Sunday night at 7:30 and there was an hour wait. So this tells you how poppin it is! People love this place even though you can't make reservations. Great vibes and great food! Bigger than I expected it to be! Divey with loud music, so don't go if you're looking for a romantic date. Staff is really friendly! Sushi is good, not great but that's expected as it's not really expensive. Definitely good tho don't get me wrong. We ordered four rolls to split between two girls and finished it all. Their miso soup was also amazing as I love extra green onions theirs had a lot and very large chunks of tofu. Eel and spicy salmon was two fav rolls. If I'm ever back in town I would totally go again!

"No one's ever ordered that much mochi before."A direct quote from one of our visits to Ryoko's. In fairness, we didn't realise that each order of mochi would be more than plenty to share, so (in a group of 8) we ordered 16 mochi, thinking that it'd be 2 pieces each. It was more like 64... Oops. It was worth it.On to the sushi: I've loved everything I've tried there, with the exception of the "sexy roll". They must have been playing the irony game naming that one. (It's got melted American cheese on it. It comes on tin foil?! Nightmare.) Ignoring that, highlights include Orange Delight, Hot Tuna, and Kentucky for me. Seriously though, it's all fantastic.Love the staff--they work tirelessly and patiently, especially when you get the odd tetchy grump who feels they're entitled to a seat because got fatigued by the wait. (Don't queue when you're hangry, folks. Or bring a snack bar.) Lastly, I'm in love with the DJ. Yep--they have an in-house DJ. Any resto playing '90s dance remixes to eat your dinner to is a winner in my books.

We came around 6pm, just in time to beat the rush. No wait for us and was seated right away. Yay!For starter, we had some fried oysters along with nigiri and sushi rolls. All were decent, but I wouldn't say it's the best sushi rolls I ever had. The nigiri was alright, but I quite honestly didn't think it was all that fresh. Service was quick and fast. This is no high end sushi, but a casual sushi joint for a quick bite. If you want better quality sushi and better value, head to South Bay for the experience.

This place definitely isn't the typical, quaint, Japanese restaurant in SF, so if you're looking for a quiet place, I don't think this is the place to go. BUT if you're looking for a place w/ a fun time and some GREAT sushi, then this is the place to go! The reason my family and I were able to get a spot was b/c we got there right before it opened, and thankfully the line wasn't too long, so we were able to be seated within 10-15 minutes. There's a small private parking lot next to the restaurant, but you have to pay about $20 for valet parking. There's also street parking available, but if you're not used to parking on hills or driving in SF in general, then I would just bite the bullet and do the valet. Let's talk about the food now. The choices are countless! Since there were 5 of us eating, we just ordered a bunch of rolls, some sake, and split accordingly. They sell fried shrimp heads! a rule of thumb from my dad -- you know a sushi place is pretty legit if they sell that here (i'm not sure what the japanese word for it is, but if a place has this, you gotta have it!) It's a crunchy, savory, briny bite that accompanies the meal well. They have your classic roll combinations, like Philadelphia and California, but they also have some unique rolls (pretty sure one of them had peanut butter in them, sounds weird, but trust me, it was delicious!) The quality of their raw fish was great - you can tell the fish was fresh and well maintained b/c it didn't smell fishy and the textures of each respective fish was nice and firm. I'm not too familiar with the other sushi options in SF, but I highly recommend this one!

Thanks to Ryoko's for a really fun and honestly unforgettable birthday dinner earlier this month. I came here with a friend pretty late on a Saturday night, like 11:45pm late, after showing up to another SF sushi spot that had already closed its kitchen, but that turned out to be a blessing after all. There's a "bouncer" at the door (he was very nice) and it's a bit downstairs so it feels a little extra cool for a dinner spot. We had a bit of a wait, but only maybe 20 minutes.We were seated right next to the dj (yeah there's a dj) which actually wasn't too loud like I was a little worried it may be. The dj "booth" is actually a closed grand piano.... which I can't decide if I love or loathe. I had a potted plant with me I'd bought earlier in the day - we were Ubering everywhere and hadn't been home - and we joked that the table was for 3; when we arrived at our table, there was a little stool for my plant (+1). Now, that actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it, since it frees up table space for more food and drink.We ordered quite a bit to start and a bottle of sake for the two of us -- we also jokingly asked for a third shot glass, which they obliged (+2).Miso soup: it was your standard miso soup, but I liked that it was more miso-y than just salty.Steamed edamame: it was firm, not overdone at all, but it was served cool (or had been left out after steaming too long before making it to our table) and I'm not too about that.Beef oroshi - seared premium black angus beef slices with grated radish and ponzu sauce: I love rare steak, as rare as I can get it, and I love me some carpaccio. This dish did not disappoint. The meat was caramelized on the outside and that combination of rich and a little-bit-chewy that a perfectly rare steak has. The ponzu dipping sauce was just the sweet and salty mix to balance the meat out.Deep fried soft shell crab: I'm not the biggest fan of deep fried stuff, and soft shell crab can sometimes come out more fried-coating than crab, but the ratio was good here. The meat was flavorful (for crab) and it was surprisingly light.Sake nigiri: this is always a go-to at sushi spots and how I assess if a place is worth getting fancier, like market price, nigiri later in the meal. Like traditional nigiri, wasabi was placed between the fish and the rice, so if you're like me and don't enjoy wasabi much, be warned.Unagi nigiri: this was not your typical sushi bar unagi nigiri, this was the softest, most melt-in-your-mouth fish I think I've ever had, no chewing required (well, besides the seaweed and rice). We got a second order of it before even finishing the first. This is an absolute MUST.I asked for toro (tuna belly) but they were out of it. My friend asked for sake toro, not on the menu, maybe on the specials(?), but they had it! We got two orders of nigiri, twice over the course of our meal. It was absolutely melt in your mouth. Salmon belly is my favorite nigiri and it made my belly very happy.My friend also ordered hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), I think it might have been on the specials board? It was the best kama I've ever had, with much thicker (read: more) flesh that was super juicy and umami while still coming off the bone like butter. The meat itself isn't mindblowing (in general, this one was pretty tasty) but dipped in the ponzu sauce, it's an orgasmic experience. Just about every bite, I closed my eyes and smiled while I savored it.The waitress recommended some bonito dish to us and we said, why not? I've never had bonito in any form besides flaked, so this was a treat. It's super meaty, like a tuna or mackerel; my friend ate most of it since it was dressed with too spicy a sauce for me. But what I did eat, I enjoyed!When I was in the restroom at the start of the meal, my friend had mentioned to our waitress that it was my birthday, and she came and sang me happy birthday with some little mochi ice cream balls. They even put three toothpicks in (one for my plant!! +3).My friend settled the bill but I know it was a lot -- this place isn't the cheapest option around by a long shot, but it's worth it for the quality of the fish, the fun environment and attentive, knowledgeable staff, and variety of offerings of specialty dishes and types of nigiri. It's a special occasion place for sure, but very special in my opinion.There are some weird af rolls on their menu I'd be down to try with like, 6 other people so everyone can just have one bite if nobody likes it (peanut butter and flying fish roe on the Volcano roll??? American cheese on the Sexy roll?? wtf).

I would't say this place is subpar but it's definitely not a place I'd frequent too often. Very long wait on a weekday night. The service here is decent; felt rushed on the order, but once we ordered the service and wait staff was almost nonexistent, had to actually raise our hand for more water and to order more. We attempted to order Nigiri and rolls of the specials board but just about each one we ordered was fresh out. The waitress made suggestions for other rolls but would make suggestions that were nothing like we wanted to order before (e.g. we wanted Maguro Natto, she offered Negihama instead). No where near what we wanted, I might be a little uppity about it but it's just not what we wanted, especially if we already ordered plenty of rolls. Anyway, sushi was cool. Nothing special or a separator, especially since they didn't have what we wanted. Natto roll was probably the best thing we had, we ordered three Natto rolls.

Walking down into the dark, dungeon-like basement that is Ryoko's, you'd never expect to find good food in such a dingy, sketchy atmosphere. And yet, the place was packed when we came for dinner on a Saturday. This restaurant only offers small plates and sushi rolls/nigiri, but their takes on these dishes are slightly unusual and worth a try!My group started with the Japanese octopus over seaweed salad and the chicken karaage small plates. The karaage was surprisingly good--I'm usually not the biggest fan of fried chicken, but the large chunks of chicken were surprisingly juicy, tender, and flavorful! We also had the grilled saba (mackerel), and you can't really go wrong with that. Then we shared a bunch of rolls--the pokemon roll was wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed and came with plenty of fresh fish. The dragon roll was wrapped in unagi and avocado, the 49er was topped with bluefin tuna/salmon, and the jumping tuna was a delicious and creative deep-fried roll stuffed with spicy tuna and served with a sweet/spicy sauce on the side. Nice! The only disappointing roll I had was the spicy scallop, from which I got a strong hit of soy sauce/salt. Other than that, all of these rolls were creative, tasty, and delicious!While pricey, the food at Ryoko's is worth a try, though don't expect much from the dingy atmosphere. Just go to enjoy the small plates, sushi, and drinks, if you're so inclined!

I would have never noticed this place nor found it if not for my friend's recommendation and literal guidance. It's a very dive-y basement sushi restaurant downtown--completely unassuming from the outside but super popular and packed inside.I came with three friends for an earlyish Tuesday dinner (right around 6). We lucked out and were able to get seated right away in the back room--super cool room with a big table, benches, and mirror wall. We could see the line outside building soon after we had arrived.We ordered a variety of different rolls--some fried ones ("jumping rolls") and some fresh ones. They were all pretty good but none of them really stood out to me. The jumping unagi roll (deep fried unagi roll) and spicy scallop roll were both tasty. I was actually pleasantly surprised at how big the scallop was in the scallop roll. I also ordered the amaebi (sweet shrimp nigiri + fried shrimp heads), which was okay here. It was fresh, but not as big or sweet as others I've had before at the same price point.Service was good! They checked on us often, even though we were in the back room. It's nice to not be forgotten :)Solid 4 stars for Ryoko's! The sushi and sashimi aren't *amazing* but it's good, and the restaurant is a very cool, hip place that's incredibly close to Union Square--worth at least one visit!

Updated review
Update: After coming back here a couple more times, the sushi prices really can't be beaten. This place is an incredible deal! That being said, I'm never really blown away by the sushi. It's good, to be sure, but I haven't had a particularly eye-opening experience quite yet. The Ika Maruyaki (grilled squid) appetizer is incredible though, and is a must get when we visit. The flavor and texture is perfect and the presentation is beautiful. I love it!I may end up coming back here when we have larger parties or want quick service and cheap sushi, but Sanraku is very close by and offers better sushi, in my opinion.

Sometimes I get those days where I leave work and think, I'm just going to treat myself to a nice dinner. Well, the other day was just that. After passing Union Square on my way home, I decided to take a different route and find a place I've never been too, eventually stumbling into Ryoko's.Irasshaimase! That's the welcome greeting you hear as you open the door. Everyone in the restaurants yells it from the top of their lungs as you walk down the stairs into their main restaurant area. There's a small host stand with someone waiting, lots of table seating and sushi bar seating. I think there's also upstairs seating as I saw a staircase but at 6pm, no one in the restaurant so everyone was sat in the bottom area. I think overall, the staff is super efficient and cordial. One thing that got a little annoying was irasshaimase chant. It was for everyone, and I get that, however they yell it loud and if you're at the sushi bar, it's piercing. There were 3 sushi chefs in a small sushi bar area so sound traveled a ton. The menu was not overwhelming at all. It's mostly sushi. You'll have a specials board and some appetizers but what you wont find is a dinner menu filled with items such as rice bowls (except for chiraishi and similar). I like that. Focus on a few things and perfect what you have. On the specials menu, they offer the expensive fish. Mostly from Japan. My server Patty was hardcore with trying to upsell the specials. She almost didn't give me an option on the type of fish. For instance, I asked her for salmon nigiri from the menu. She instead suggested the Toki Salmon toro on the specials menu for almost doubled the price but said it in a way that really wasn't an option. "Ok sake toro is ok, yeah?" I had to stick to my guns and say no and that I'll just take the sake on the menu. It happened a couple of times; laughable but still a little too much. Speaking of food here's what I got: -Kai Miso Soup for $4.50. I started with this winner: you average miso soup with clams! I've had a similar dish at another restaurant and loved the element of clams, so this was great. -Sake (Salmon) nigiri for $6.00 and order (2 pieces to an order). I highly recommend just getting this salmon as opposed to the specials for $12.80 an order. This sake was buttery, melting in my mouth and didn't come with an overbearing fish flavor. I got 4 orders of this so 8 pieces later, I was treated to a great meal! Loved it. I also love that they shave their own wasabi! It was a great element and really made a difference-Chu Toro (Fatty Tuna) nigiri for $16.80 an order. So this was one I didn't want to skimp on. I love fatty tuna. When I got the nigiri, it didn't look like other toro nigiris I've received. It was darker in color but OH-EM-GEE, it tasted exactly like a great Toro! This was buttery than the sake. I love how the sushi chefs really highlight the fish and not overpower the dish with lots of rice, just enough to enhance. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.-Salmon skin roll for $7.00. Grilled salmon skin, shiso peppers, cucumber, burdock root and flying fish roe served with bonito flakes and mayo. It came with 5 pieces and it was good. At first, looked like your average maki sushi, the elements were there and worked well together. Not the biggest stand out but good overall.What a great treat. I didn't feel overly full afterwards. I was content with the fresh fish and great flavors every bite offered. Ryoko's will definitely happen again for me! Go check them out.

very busy place even you come to there late. so expect to wait a bit, but their turnover is pretty ok. we waited about 20 minutes to sit, the waiter did mess up our place in queue and we had to remind him. rather than that, the service was pretty good. food was excellent, very authentic and creative - unique combination. we ordered Pokemon, jumping unagi, jumping tuna, spider roll, Crunchy Crab, a few others. all taste very good.

I am allergic to fish but my boyfriend loves sushi and this is always our go-to late night sushi spot in SF. They are open until 2AM DAILY! Which is clutch when you have sushi cravings at 12:57am on a Tuesday night (if you come on a weekend, please be aware that they will likely have a line, but it will be worth it). They have a DJ so it can get loud, but it isn't unbearable and is one of my favorite features of the restaurant. Come here if you want to eat sushi while you nod your head to some hip-hop and r&b greatest hits/classics.

Get here early if you want to eat here. After 6:30-7PM, the line is INSANELY long. It's under the basement, they play club-like music, the lights and mirror details and decorations make it a really nice ambience, with a mixture of divey-ness. Our group of 5 ordered 8 rolls, and we probably each had 9-10 pieces each. We got the jumping tuna, sunrise, dragon, big mama, scallop, and the pokemon rolls. We got the sunrise one twice, because it was just THAT good. I was a huge fan of the jumping tuna, sunrise, and dragon roll. Big scallop and big mama was alright, but pokemon was a strange one, and our group didn't like it. The sweetness of the mango was nice, but the cabbage really threw us off.Overall, you can taste the quality and freshness of the fish. After each piece, we all savored the taste and each one of us said "wow... that was really, really good". That's how great this place is. We topped the meal off with mochi ice cream, which was really delicious. Highly recommend the mango flavor, it was sweet and refreshing. The skin of the mochi is also quite thick, so you get extra chewy goodness. Would come back and retry my favorites, and try other appealing rolls!

If you come to Ryoko's for dinner, be prepared to do a bang bang*. After seeing this place have so many rave reviews, I brought my friend from LA to check it out. I was warned from Yelpers that the portion sizes are on the smaller side, but I still wasn't prepared for how small it actually was! We ordered 4 rolls (orange delight, hot tuna, hamachi and I think alcatraz) and an appetizer (octopus) between 4 people and I doubt that the plates that showed up would even have fed 2 :( Besides the beef with the portion sizes, I did like how the sushi quality and taste. The hot tuna had this interesting hint of cumin in it but I'm pretty sure there wasn't any. Orange delight was really fresh. I also liked the octopus -- it had a nice grilled flavor and came on a bed of spring mix. Ambiance: As my friend put it, "not stuffy", and I agree. This is a good place to kick back after a long day walking around the city. They've got a decent sound system, and I could see this restaurant easily evolving into a bar-y scene as the night goes on. * when you eat your first meal and then follow it with a second full meal. Props to Louis C.K.

Ryoko's is one of my favorite spots in the Lower Nob Hill neighborhood. The atmosphere is fun, funky, and casual. It's a great place for a casual date or a quick bite with friends. Most of the menu items are reasonably priced and everything tastes delicious. I always order the Ika Maruyaki (whole grilled squid) and Chicken Karaage (fried chicken), along with a large hot sake. The squid is very flavorful, not overly fishy, and very tender. The fried chicken has a thick, crispy skin and the meat is very juicy/moist. The sushi rolls are also delicious and different from the typical rolls you might find at a chain sushi restaurant. However, you only get 5 pieces per order, so the rolls end up being pretty pricey for what you get.The restaurant fills up pretty quickly, so I recommend arriving right at 6pm or after 9pm unless you want to wait in line for 40 minutes.

This place became a favorite of mine instantly! After a long day being in traffic being frustrated, we happened to come across this place and it turned my night around the delicious sushi and the fun conversations with the owner/sushi chef definitely made the atmosphere enjoyable. We learned a bit of the places history and it was nice to learn its in the family from mother to son.... i cant exress how enjoyable the place was but i will say that by the end of the night i had fallen in love with this place!

This is the best sushi I've found in the city. The wait is long, and the waiting area is weird but its definitely worth it. The sashimi was very fresh, I would order one of the nigiri or sashimi dinners next time just to try more variety. We got the jumping tuna roll and the crunchy crab roll and both were awesome! The prices were on par with other sushi places and it was overall a really good experience. FYI most of the tables are for 2 so I think the wait could be even longer with more than 2, plus its dark and kind of cramped inside so I wouldn't recommend for groups.

Fantastic. The wait time is a little on the long side, but it was worth it every time I came. Really cool hole-in-the-wall, cozy, hip atmosphere with excellent, excellent sushi. Have been there a few times and will definitely be back.

This is a busy restaurant in a small space. If you have a large party, there is only one room/table available as an option. They do not take reservations. Luckily, we arrived early enough to secure that spot. People who don't want to pay for valet are trying to secure a yellow zone parking after 6pm. I wouldn't do that if you're waiting for that room in the back. The restaurant has a loud fun vibe. There are stairs going down to the restaurant. The ladies restroom is up a flight of stairs. The spacing is crowded. Intimate. The food is 5 stars, the items from the special menu, at least. They didn't get shipments for the holiday weekend, so variety was limited. My favorites of the night include uni, aji, hamachi toro niguri and scallop sashimi. I rarely order uni because I usually don't like it. I don't like the taste of ocean. My friends convinced me that I will like this one and they were right. No aftertaste. Fresh = no after taste. You get two hours to eat and they will let you know when your last order will take place. The service was good enough. The servers were not always able to answer questions on preparation. Receiving the answering "sometimes," was not a good answer. So what you get isn't always consistent. Im not referring to omakase, where change is expected. Overall good experience. Fun atmosphere. Good vibe. Fresh fish. 4.5 stars

When you walk in, the whole restaurant shouts a greeting at you. The seating is very tight. The waitress was very nice. She gave us her name and asked us to call her if we needed anything. Everything moved pretty quick. She brought our drinks, took our order and within ten minutes, we had five rolls on the table. The rolls were good. We didn't have any qualms with them. I'm not fond of bean sprouts, so that was a personal downside for me. Other than that, we enjoyed the sushi. Before we go back, I would probably check out other sushi in town first.

I've been to quite a few, and this is my favorite sushi place in SF. Food is 4/5, but the unpretentious late night weekend vibes with the live music/dj push it to a 5! Service is quick and pleasant. Best of all, you can afford to eat to your hearts content with almost any budget. Expect a long line but short wait, despite the smaller location size.Bonus points for entry being down easily-missed stairs for the 'underground' vibe, hah!

Coming from a huge sushi lover I was highly disappointed with this sushi place. I dont even know how their rating is so high. For a guy who dislikes mcdonalds or fast food in general I woulda picked to eat mcdonalds over this place anyday. My gf and i spent $120 for 4 rolls 2 drinks and 2 miso soups. I would have rsther spent that $120 at a fancy steakhouse or other restaurant. Lets just say I would have rather bought $120 dollars worth mcdonalds and pass em out to the homeless people.Seating is crowded and it only holds up to 45 guest at a time. Dragon roll for $20 and was skimpedThe raw fish wasn't as fresh as it could have been. Not really much of a variety in rolls. For a 4 star joimt id expected them to have bento boxes or some sort of food. This is more of a bar food like enviornment.Miso soup was really salty.Only thing i liked was the fried oysters.The music was a little too loud, to the point where our waitress couldn't hear us and had to keep repeating ourselves multiple times. Would not recommend this place at all

Probably the best Japanese food in a basement dive bar setting. If you're looking for very good sushi in a bar with a DJ setting, and not pretentious in the traditional sense, this is perfect.+ Fresh seafood+ Good service (for a bar setting)+ Nice vibe- missed in a few details- presentation is okFor both negatives it's not their schtick so it works!

Decent sushi overshadowed by long lines, pounding club music, and rushed service. Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. Arrived 10 minutes before opening and was the 5th party in line.We ordered the house salad, angus beef, eel and avocado roll, rainbow roll, salmon skin roll, and jumping tuna. The rainbow, salmon skin, and jumping tuna were great. Nothing else stood out. The beef was a bit disappointing, simply a steak cut into thin pieces. Teriyaki beef may have been a better choice.The lighting, tight quarters, underground location, and loud music made this feel more like a dance club than a sushi restaurant. Eating sushi to blaring EDM music is not a pleasant experience. Furthermore, there appeared to be only 2 or 3 servers for the whole restaurant, and they appeared woefully understaffed.Definitely feel like this place is overhyped.

Arrived at around 6:15pm on a Saturday night and there was no wait for a table for 2, and I saw that there were more than a few tables still open. However, the spots filled up quick, and by 6:30pm and definitely by 6:45pm there was a line for a table. You don't have to get here right when they open to snag a table, but I'd definitely suggest getting here before 6:30pm.Ambiance is a bit dark and dingy, with loud music and cramped quarters. I had the agedashi tofu to start (piping hot and comes with 3 large chunks of tofu), and the Hot Tail (yellowtail, spicy sauce, shiso, and cucumber) and Jumping Tuna (spicy tuna, cucumber, and shiso, rolled and deep fried) rolls. Both rolls were tasty, but I was a little more partial to the Hot Tail roll. The rolls were reasonably priced, and were both under $10. Service was friendly enough, but a little bit harried and brusque. It also took awhile for us to get the attention of our waitress to request our check. Overall, a solid spot, but not awe inspiring.

We asked how many pieces the chirashi bowl was and the waitress said she didn't know. We asked what kinds of fish were in it and she said, "I don't know, it's just a bunch of fish on top". The chirashi bowl ended up being 40% made up of fish scraps the size of my thumbnail and the rest of the fish was really poor quality and falling apart! Also there was a bunch of asparagus scraps and masago scattered on top which was weird. I really regret spending my money here! Avoid if you can. You can get cheaper and better quality sushi from anywhere else and you probably won't have to wait as long.

It was good but it wasn't great. We came in pretty late but the place was packed. We managed to snag two seats at the bar. I ordered a hot sake and two rolls. Their prices are high for what you get. My rolls were very small. I pay less for more at my local place, but hey that's what I get for eating sushi in the bay, haha.The sake was good, however it was a little small for a large. I think our bill totaled out to $36.00 with my three items being the only three on there.Fun atmosphere but not that great for the price.

The quality of the sashimi was extremely disappointing. I got a sashimi platter and the fish was bland and overall tasted old. For example, the scallop was not sweet at all and had a bitter aftertaste. The shrimp was absolutely miserable, dry as a bone. Tuna tasted like nothing. The only thing that was alright was the salmon, but you couldn't even find bad salmon if you tried. Also, they charged $2 for a cup of tea, which no real, traditional Japanese restaurant even does. On top of that, they charge $40 for a sashimi platter... If you want real sushi go to a place like Saru sushi instead.Just don't come here

Ryoko's is my go to spot when I want really good fresh sashimi without breaking the bank.Admittedly, most of the time that I eat Japanese food, it's at somewhere "average." *gasp* (Oh don't look at me like that, you know you all do it!)But every once in awhile, I take a good look at myself in the mirror and say "You deserve better than this." In comes Ryoko's.I almost always get the 14 pc sashimi plate. Each piece of fish is so fresh and so melt in your mouth buttery soft. I'm like yeeesss, I do deserve this!Miso soup + sake + fresh sashimi + EDM... this is most definitely my happy place. Yes there can be a wait, but I eat pretty late anyway so by the time I'm ready to eat dinner the wait isn't so bad.

Price: unreasonable. $8.5 for 5 pieces of takoyaki. Not to mention other dishes. Definitely overpriced.Sushi: below average. Ordered salmon, yellowtail, sweet shrimp, tamago, salmon roe and toro.Sweet shrimp is the only one that's good.Environment: really noisy and dark. The staff are nice and the atmosphere is relaxing and chill (DJ play live music). Maybe it's a good place to hang out with friends at night, but absolutely not an authentic Japanese restaurant to enjoy sushi.

The sushi restaurant was a mistake...Preface: In SF for my 23rd birthday and see this awesome restaurant with a lot of reviews on Yelp.So first off we were already waiting for awhile, but there were people still before us and it began to get more packed with more people waiting as time went on. The hostess/waitress would call names; however, as more and more time progressed the hostess/waitress started to skip people who were waiting easily 45 minutes-1 hr before. So we complained that they skipped multiple couples that had been waiting the longest out of everyone along with other groups including us. After bringing this issue up, they began seating according to the actual list of names. The food was delicious until the check comes it's $101... needless to say we didn't order anything close to $101...we did the math items were doubled charged and over charged...the bill was mess. Moral of the story we really couldn't do anything so we rounded up a gave them 46 cent tip....before you all get offended on my pettiness. I work in the food service industry at a restaurant supply company throwing and lifting 50 pound bags of potatoes, onions, along with boxes of beef and chicken etc while walking 12 miles a day in steel toed boots and I don't expect a tip. If you can't do your job properly and give decent service, while under a little stress, you're a joke and new profession.Conclusion: To end the sushi was good, but not worth the hassle.

This place is perfect for date night but the wait may be about 30min-an hour depending on when you come. We got lucky with parking and saw at least 5 other cars on the same street leaving! While you wait, the servers come around asking if you'd like to order drinks! Truly a hole underground! Wonderful little spot! Very intimate and can be a little overwhelming if you don't like crowds. The food is spectacular! The menu items from Japan were extremely fresh and scrumptious. Each bite sent me to heaven and back. My favorite was the sake (salmon) and uni! We tried the amaebi (sweet shrimp). It comes with the raw body and deep fried head! The nigiri portion was way too soft and "melting in my mouth" texture but the deep fried heads were delicious!

Came here at 9pm on a Saturday night because the place I wanted to go to up the street was closed. The guy outside told me it would be a 10-15 minute wait since I was by myself. Took 45 minutes to get seated and the check in list was not being seated in order. When I got seated, a server came by quickly to ask if I wanted drinks. I ordered an Asahi on tap which was considerably cheap for the price. It wasn't until another 10 minutes when I finally waved someone down to place my order. I ordered the chirashi and man was it one of the worst ones I've had at any sushi bar that can maintain a 4-star at over 2k reviews. It was loaded with an assortment of low-tier fish that was most not fresh except for maybe the salmon but only when compared to the utterly garbage fish like the overly salty eel and dry eel. For $31 for the chirashi, there were no premium cuts of fish like sweet shrimp or uni. The cuts given were small and did not taste well together. Why there was asparagus inside the bowl is beyond me. $35 before tip/tax can get you a much fuller and higher quality meal elsewhere.

Ryoko's is definitely my go to sushi place in Nob Hill. It's a bit divey, open late, has rare sushi options, there was a DJ playing when I went - so you can't beat the atmosphere.But if there were .5 ratings it would get a 3.5 because even for all that it is a bit pricey and you don't get the biggest slices of fish compared to other spots in the City.My first time here was on a date where I was the first to get a seat, and we got a mix of nigiri and rolls and it was a solid meal if the check came out over $100.This most recent trip, I had just ended a date at Benjamin Cooper and was craving something good nearby and I did want sushi. Being by myself, I quickly got sat at the bar and careened my neck to see what special, rare fish they had.Again, one of the best things about this place is their rare selection. This night I got:-Kanpachi (amberjack) - A big fan, even if this was pricier than other places and thinner cut.-Torigai (Japanese Cockle) - First time trying these. Very chewy but with a great flavor.-Kamasu (Japanese Barracuda) - MY FAVORITE of the night, seared giving it some extra umami that was similar to black cod. Sadly these pieces were also tiny and I had considered getting another 2 if not for their price tag.-Karei (Flounder) - Big fan of flounder and these were the biggest pieces. A nice, light white fish.-Hamachi Toro - Who doesn't love Hamachi? And who doesn't love toro? You got that nice, fatty flavor combined with hamachi's delicious flavor. Really good even if I would have preferred a thicker slice.-Sake (Salmon) - The most basic, but I love salmon and the cheapest at $6.-Sake (Hot) - I was taking bart, why not keep drinking something warm on a cold July night.They had some other special fish, including blue fin, but considering this was already up to $60, I decided better stop while I was good. My server, who may have been the only server, was amazing. She was running around but knew who needed help and continually let us at the bar know if we needed something. The DJ was also great and complimented my Dragon Ball hoodie.

Came here late night around 12:30am. This place was busy and there was a good vibe going with the live DJ. Unfortunately I guess there was only 1 waitress there because it took a while to get our drink/order in. She sat us down and failed to tell us that their kitchen was closed so after looking at the menu for 10-15 minutes getting all excited, we were told we couldn't order any specials or any appetizers. Ordered the Toro Sushi - it was alright. I've had better. It was $18 for two pieces and I had higher expectations. Spicy scallop roll - not great at all - flavors were bland. Jerry Roll - probably my favorite out of everything we ordered. Uni sushi - decentSalmon sushi - decentSexy roll - Overcooked and baked on cheap aluminum foil so the whole bottom of the roll was stuck on the foil. I probably would not come back here again. It wasn't very satisfying.

I was really excited to try this place since it's really popular and has a fun atmosphere. The food itself was just okay (3 stars) but we had a terrible experience with the bill at the end of our meal.Fortunately the prices are really reasonable so you can try a few different things. I really enjoyed the hiyashi wakame ($5) which is a seaweed salad dish. The shrimp and vegetable tempura ($9) and agedashi tofu ($5) appetizers were tasty but nothing special. The deep fried oysters ($7) were enormous so if you really like those I thought that was a good deal. For sushi we got the jumping unagi ($9) which was basically deep fried unagi rolls and the hot tuna roll ($7). I thought both of them were fairly mediocre quality but reasonable for the price.Regarding the negative experience at the end, the server sat our party of 2 at a large table shared with other parties of 2 we didn't know. That in itself was great and helped cut the wait time for us. The issue was each separate party had ordered their own meals and drinks but when it came to the bill the server had put the entire table on one tab and wouldn't split it for each separate party. So our table had to figure out who ordered what and it got so complex in the end we just split the bill evenly across all parties which was really frustrating for everyone (and my fiance and I ended up overpaying our actual amount). After that entire ordeal it then took over 20 minutes for them to give our cards back. I rarely have had such a frustrating dining experience.

This is a weird and fun place to eat sushi as it is a combination of both a restaurant and a night club as the music is very loud and they have a DJ. There was a bunch of people waiting to get a table when I got there, but the line moved pretty fast. We ordered five rolls and a seaweed salad, and we only waited for about 10 minutes to get our food. The food was amazing and reasonably priced. I had a great experience and I'm looking forward to coming back.

Ryoko's definitely has a vibe of its own with the dim lighting, loud music, interesting seating arrangements, and sushi bar. I guess you could say it has character. This is a great place to chow down on Japanese food with friends while having some sake and beer. Being the leaf eater that I am, my options were somewhat limited. However, the rolls that I did get were pretty satisfying! I've had the Jumping Veggie, Vegetable Melody, and Humboldt roll and enjoyed them all. The rolls are pretty medium sized in terms of portion and you will most likely want to order 2 (or more) in order to be full. I have had the fried cheese appetizer which is really good, but a bit small.I would highly recommend this place to my friends even though there aren't overwhelming options for me. Service has never been an issue here for me. The line outside does start forming a bit before the restaurant opens for dinner, but you won't face that long of a wait if you come within the first hour that they are open. However, if you show up after that, particularly with a large group, you may be huddled by the door or on the steps.

The worst sushi experience I have ever had in San Francisco. Fish is not fresh, couldn't eat the sashimi at all. The rolls are plain and so loosely made that stuffs come out when it gets to our table. Presentation is absolutely ugly for such high prices. 2 stars for fast service and nice waitress. Can't recommend this place and won't ever come back.

While there is usually a really long wait to be seated, the fish at Ryoko's is worth it.Seaweed salad: yum. Get it. No questions. Yellowtail with scallions: fine, nothing special. Citrusy and refreshing, the Pokemon roll was delicious. Despite the peanut butter in it, the volcano roll was super-interesting. Small sake for $5 with enough for 2 people is a big bonus.The atmosphere can get rowdy sometimes: too many hipsters doing their first sake bomb or something, I guess.With classic jams playing in the background, Ryoko's is a cool place to have some good fish.

We went here for a late night dinner because there were not many options that night. When we arrived, they informed us that the kitchen just closed and that they were only serving cold items and sushi. We sat down right away because there were not many people there. They was a DJ playing some tracks but to be honest it was a little too loud. We asked the server what was fresh that day and she pointed out the menu items listed on the wall. We decided to try most of the items and got a cold sake. I was a little disappointed in the selections, but I couldn't be too picky. There were also some items that were not available and it was kind of weird because we thought that those items would come from the sushi bar. I would have to say that about half of the sashimi and rolls were decent. The rest of them did not taste very fresh. I am assuming they cater mostly to the drinking crowd, but drunk people still have some semblance of taste and it did not taste very good. The only thing that was really good was the sake that we ordered with our meal. Really overpriced for the quality of the meal.Will definitely want to try out this place again, but maybe a little bit earlier in the night or day. If the quality is the same as this experience, will not be going back.

I LOVE this place!I was first introduced to Ryoko's several years ago through my then roommate who found it while walking around the city. He quickly told me about it and we went there to eat quite often. Then I moved from the city and I forgot about this place until recently when I was meeting a friend downtown for dinner and he suggested sushi. My mind quickly pulled this restaurant from the archives and I almost yelled "I know the perfect place!!" We were there on Monday (President's Day) so I wasn't sure if they would be open but yes they were! And we arrived around 7pm, just an hour after they opened and the restaurant was crowded. Not a single place to sit. So we put our names on the wait list and waited patiently for a table, which was about 20 minutes. I guess we arrived at the perfect time because within seconds there were about four other groups behind us waiting for tables. We order some edamame and miso soups to start. I had a green tea (my throat was scratchy) and my friend had a beer. The soup was some of the best soups I've had! and the tea was grassy and toasty! Just perfect. We also ordered three sushi rolls. The Alcatraz, The Philadelphia, and the Jumping California. There were amazingly good that we devoured them in no time. I do think the rolls are a bit small, and the place is loud! Also, my friend pointed out something that I never noticed before: the only exit is the front door. We couldn't see another exit from where we were sitting. This made him nervous since the restaurant is in a basement! Where do we run in case of an emergency???

I would love to give Ryoko five stars. However, I cannot do that. The wait was about 20 to 30 minutes considering the place is really small there isn't much space to stand. I'm not one to complain but our server spilled my friends beer all over her coat. Then she walked off leaving the fizzy beer on our table. I would think she would apologize and know to get a new beer by herself but no. She instead looked dumbfounded when we asked for another since the one on the table was half gone and fizzy. This is not a fancy place, so I can understand that the customer service is not what you would expect but dam, at least offer to clean her jacket or a discount.There was a live Dj that was nice and overall the prices are not bad.

Food: All of their rolls and nigiri are pretty fresh (including the uni), some fish is even straight from Japan. They also have unique rolls like deep-fried BBQ eel and avocado (called the Jumping Unagi). However the portions are really way too small for the price.Don't get the karaage chicken. It looks big like there's a lot but it's mostly just fluff or batter, very little actual meat.Noise level: really loud. You will need to lean in to hear or speak to the person directly across from you.Parking: won't likely find any nearby.Line: expect a 40+ min wait on a wed-sat night

Meh - it's ok. Years ago when I first came to Ryoko's I thought it was super fresh and tasty. I came recently and did not think the same thoughts as before... if you're looking for a pretty legit sushi experience, there are other places in the city. The restaurant is kind of like a hole in the wall, since you have to go down into the basement level and then the tables are really close together. We ordered a pretty wide selection of rolls and sushi and the quality was a pretty wide-ranging mix. On the other hand, the fried tofu was really delicious, but it was fried so how could you go wrong? If there was absolutely no wait, I MIGHT come back again, but... it's not worth the wait.

Ryoko's holds a special place in my heart as its one of the first places I went to eat when I moved to the Bay many years ago. I remember thinking "this place seems really SF". And boy, was I right. Ryokos best described is an underground club-like sushi bar with fresh fish and great music and vibes.Don't let the grungy super packed nature of this place fool you - the food is impeccable. They have a lot of fish flown in from Japan and their menu has lots of unique and delicious items. A lot of it is traditional - you won't really find much of the California-Fusion Japanese food here. A bit on the pricey side from other options in the area, but well worth the extra dough. You must try the fresh fishes of the day - a lot of them you probably want to Google since they are usually pretty obscure. I've tried glassfish here which is by far the weirdest thing I've had at a Japanese restaurant in SF. Aside from the nigiri and sashimi specials, I'd recommend getting rolls from their menu as well as appetizers. I love their takoyaki and their sunomono salad. I think a lot of their rolls are simple, but it really lets their usage of ingredients and fresh fish shine through. Service is rushed, but friendly, especially if you sit at the bar. Great vibes here - usually can strike some good conversations with fellow sushi-goers. Lots of locals come here frequently and the chefs are all super friendly. Great place for quick eats or for a authentic meal. There is usually a line however, but since the place is decently large and they flip tables fast the wait isn't that bad. Open super late so great option for late night munchies or bar hopping!

From the tongue of an Asian girl. A friend recommended me this place and the queue was long before the restaurant even opened. So I had high expectations of its food. I had NYE dinner here and it was a full house (lucky we lined up 10 minutes before it opened)! I didn't quite like it, the food was average. The portion was small and thus is pricey for its small serving! The service was not satisfactory because the server was in a rush (perhaps to attend other tables as well) and thus did not offer a good service. My orders were: VOLCANO ROLL - 2/5CRUNCHY CRAB ROLL - 2/5HIYASHI WAKAME - 3/5 - Typical wakame salad, - too small but its fresh!JUMPING TUNA - 3/5 SABA SHIOYAKI - 3/5 - Yummy and healthy but way too much bones (hurt me). TODAY'S SPECIAL FISH - 1/5 - Won't order this anymore, spent so much time trying to get the bones out and ended up swallowing some.

I've came here for numerous occasions. It's definitely worth the wait I must say. I usually order their nigiri as the fish they have are absolutely amazing as fresh. The uni they use are also flown in from Japan.Reasonably priced too.I believe they serve food until 1:30am.Probably the best sushi restaurant in nobhill.Try to arrive as soon as they're open or if not perhaps later would be good.

Great late night bite. We stopped in moments before last call and hurried to pick sushi. I settled on four rolls to share with my husband and was not disappointed. The food came out quickly and the quality was excellent. The shiitake sushi roll was an unexpected delight. Mushrooms have a natural meatiness, but their use as the star of a sushi roll was inspired. The tuna in the Tahoe roll was ruby red and flavorful. The spicy scallop was very fresh and rounded out beautiful by the addition of shiso. Finally, the sakepeper (or something like that) was a beautiful fatty salmon, capers and shiso. It was so clean and actually quite remarkable.Service was prompt and just warm enough. The host wasn't afraid to mince words and let us know that we better hurry. I actually appreciate that candor at 1:30am. It was the perfect end of a VERY long travel day.

love this place even though there is usually a really long wait for the table and food. We got the yellowtail with scallions, pokemon roll, a fried crab roll, spicy tuna roll and the volcano roll. We also got a small sake which is more than enough for two people and only $5!The standouts were definitely the pokemon, spicy tuna and volcano roll! The pokemon is citrusy and so light and refreshing as is the spicy tuna with just enough kick. The volcano roll is super interesting and regardless of the peanut butter in it, I will definitely get it again!Also love the ambience with the cool classic jams!

Came here the other week for dinner. Parking first off was awful. Parked at a garage and walked a handful of blocks but that's to be expected in the city.Wait was about 25 minutes. If you see people standing outside that's a bad sign. Wait will be long. I had the chirashi bowl. Not impressed. But I also had the pork belly which was tasty and worth ordering. Shrimp tempura was average. Seating is very tight. I sat at the bar. Loud. Overall just okay.Won't be back.
