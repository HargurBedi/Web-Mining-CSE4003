The House is perfection. I've been here at least 10 times and I just keep coming back for more! The interior is small yet cozy, the reservations require a call-in (which I think makes it do-able to get a reservation) and the food is amazing. My favorites have remained the same through the years: -Tuna with nori chips-Sea bass - a MUST! The sauce is amazing and it comes with garlic noodles-Ribye - HO DAMN. The flavor is on point, cooked perfectly and coated with crunchy bitsThe House is good for date night. It's good for parents. It's good for business dinners. It's just DAMN GOOD.

This restaurant serves consistently delicious, perfectly cooked food for incredibly reasonable prices, especially for what you get.For appetizer, I highly recommend the grilled octopus w/ avocado, potatoes & sriracha aioli for $16.I love the kurobuta pork chop w/ pomegranate currant sauce which is $28. (1 of their most popular dishes)The grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy noodles is another popular main dish for $31.Prime angus ribeye is good as well for $35.4.5 stars (but rounding up to 5) for this restaurant as they could improve service as some staff look/act like zombies from time to time. Other than that, I've received & observed great service the past 5x I've been here.

So glad we had a reservation. The place is quite small and simple. The tables are pretty close to each other so if you are looking for an intimate dining experience, this may not be the place for you. The food however, is amazing! They have a great wine list and while the menu is limited, they do have some specials as well. The sea bass with the garlic noodles was delicious and fresh. The fish was soft and buttery and perfectly cooked and the garlicky noodles complemented it perfectly. The other dishes we ordered were all really tasty and so was dessert (bittersweet mousse cake)! The House is definitely one of my favorite Asian fusion places and I will be back! Don't recommend this place for vegetarians as I didn't notice anything vegetarian on the menu. Might be best to call them and check before you head there.

The House is definitely a must try if you're living in San Francisco. It's my favorite Asian Fusion restaurant in the city and I can't get enough of the Wasabi Noodles here! My go-to dish here is the Flatiron Steak with Wasabi Noodles! The thin pieces of meat are cooked to perfection and the wasabi noodles has a nice spicy kick to it. I'm obsessed! I even saved it as leftovers to eat 2 days later, and it was still equally delicious after microwaving it! The Seabass here is also worth trying. The fish literally melts in your mouth every bite and tastes so soft and buttery. Order one these two dishes and you won't be disappointed!If you're looking for a nice place to take your significant other to dinner and don't want to break your wallet, then definitely give The House a try! It's also really easy to make reservations over the phone too! Beware parking is quite a challenge since it's located in a busy part of North Beach!

My photos do not look very good as the lighting was not conducive to quality photography, but the food here was really good and loved dining here.The area is pretty tight and we went on a Friday night for a second dinner during the hottest weekend in sf, so the place felt like a sauna but I really liked it nonetheless. Perhaps from who I was with, possibly from the friendly table neighbors. We ordered the scallops, mussels and the crab. Everyone was getting the fried crab appetizer and we were highly encouraged by the woman next to us, but it was pretty average. I'd definitely get the scallops again. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was very flavorful but not too overbearing. The mussels were also pretty good. I'd like to be back to eat more of a hearty meal here.Service was great too! Photos on the wall, not so much. Strange momotaro images made me a bit uneasy. Tbh 4.5 but still worth the wait imo!

3.5 stars. I was super stoked to give The House a try, but I guess my expectations were way too high.We came in on a Friday night, around 7pm, without a reservation. The wait time was estimated to be about 30 minutes. They have a reservation system where it'll text you when your table is ready, so no need to linger around and wait.Along with the standard menu, they have a long list of specials that the server will describe out. I found this to be unhelpful as items were easy to miss and we had to ask him to repeat the list.We ordered the softshell crab appetizer (special), kobe beef tartare (special), and dumplings for our appetizers. For the main entrees, we ordered the korean short ribs and sea bass. Presentation here was on point!The softshell crab appetizer was unique and was served alongside a side of spicy soba noodles--pretty good. I'm not a fan of raw beef so I didn't try the tartare, but my s/o said that there was way too much sauce to taste the beef flavor. Last and most disappointing, were the dumplings. For some reason, I thought that they'd be pan fried, but nope, they were boiled and kinda sad looking TBH. The flavor of the dumplings were nothing special.Onto the entrees: the korean short ribs were delish! Served with a side of rice, some broccolini, kimchi, and a mountain of fried sweet potato ribbons. The short ribs were nice and tender, but I wish there was a bigger portion of it. Half of the dish ended up being kimchi and sweet potato.The sea bass is probably what The House is known for, and I completely agree, the fish was cooked perfectly! However, everything else that came along with it was extremely salty. The fish was already well seasoned, but paired alongside the noodles and green beans and dipping sauce, it was a salt overload! Service was attentive, our glasses were never empty for more than a minute or so. Overall - glad I gave The House a try, but sadly, I don't think I'd come back for more.

Tucked away on Grant Ave., you would totally miss the place if it weren't for the people lining up outside waiting for their party to be called. Luckily, my friend made a reservation in advance, we showed up early, and we were promptly seated shortly after.The restaurant is busy. There's no way around it, yet their service and staff are on their A game, juggling their many to-do's and customers. My glass never saw the halfway mark and the waitress knew exactly how to describe flavors and answer my party's questions.My friend and I shared two small plates for our appetizer. The first was the Caesar salad with the deep-fried scallops. I'm a sucker for a good Caesar salad and the scallops were a nice treat to accompany the greens. But the grilled unagi appetizer, holy moly! The thick eel filet was hearty and succulent and perfectly matched with a seasoned avocado sushi rice. I still think about that eel dish to this day and if you do decide to get any kind of small plate, get the one with the unagi #casualFriendsreferenceFor my entree, I had the flat iron Angus steak with wasabi noodles. You're not getting his with the overbearing, sinus-cleansing type of wasabi you would normally get globbed up in a dish at your casual sushi joint. The flavor is subtle and expertly dressed on the noodles which are accompanied with housemade kimchi and other pickled vegetables. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered.My friend had their lamb special that was being offered for the night of our visit. I'm not a huge lamb guy, I'm not fond of the gaminess in particular. But I had a bite and I could tell right off the bat that this lamb was cooked with care and precision. No gaminess and it just melted into your mouth. The three double-boned lamb lollipops were served with what seemed to be normal white rice. Be wary though, my friend's special was double the price tag of my steak dish and I feel like I ultimately got the better deal taste to price wise.Long story short, order that unagi dish!

This is a good restaurant but I am in no great hurry to revisit. The food was beautifully prepared and extremely tasty and the service was quick and very nice. The fish was awesome - tasty with flavors very well balanced. It is a small and unassuming spot. Pricing is a bit high and I did not feel fully sated, but I did enjoy the restaurant.

This is my 2nd visit to The House. My first visit was probably about 3 years ago (wasn't a fan of the steak wasabi noodles). Anyway, I tried 3 different items on this on visit and they were all pretty darn good. Parking sucks around the area and it's a dim, cramped, little spot but I think the food and service make it worthwhile. So, the bf and I came on a Saturday around 10pm. The restaurant was pretty full. Surprisingly got a table with no wait & with no prior reservations. The server brought us waters and menus. A few minutes later, he brought out complimentary pickled cucumbers and told us the specials. We went ahead and just ordered some items from the regular menu.Grilled unagi, avocado sushi rice, shaved bonito - $13Steamed mussels in garlic infused shrimp broth - $13Kurobuta pork chop, pomegranate currant sauce - $28The mussels were savory and had like a garlicky, brothy flavor. The sushi was good (wouldn't say it's the best ever but nonetheless, good). The pork chop was super yummy! Not dry. We were a little hesitant at first (pomegranate on pork sounded a little strange) but someone told us it was good so we tried it and it did not disappoint! Servers were very attentive and kept refilling our waters. Good food & service!

Came here for lunch on a Monday. It was still my birthday weekend and we were in town as a stop-over on our way to Palo Alto. Looking at the reviews on Yelp and seeing how crowded they were on that overcast morning, we were suddenly very excited to try out their offerings from the moment we walked in. We tried the Salmon spring rolls to start--this was a direct result of some of the reviews we read. They were very well flavored and with just the right amount of crunch. Good so far but I've had similar in a popular chain of restaurants so I wasn't blown away as I thought I might be. Next, I tried the halibut and while I would say the amount of food offered was not a lot, the fish was cooked absolutely perfectly with just the right amount of crispness on the edges. It was placed over thick noodles that seemed to be high in liquid smoke, but quite good. I was definitely happy. And as it was my birthday, we opted for flourless chocolate cake and a scoop of coffee-flavored ice cream (which they comped). It was surprising how typically American the desserts were. Not a problem, but just an observation. I'd say we left happy, though maybe for the amount we spent, we felt like the value wasn't the greatest. Still very good.

Came to The House with high recommendations from our friends. Do make reservations here, the restaurant is tiny! We made reservations on Tuesday night and were able to get seated right away.We got the uni appetizer. For our entrees, we ordered the specials which were the miso cod and the lamb dish. It was good, however I think this place is over hyped. I think my favorite thing was the kimchee that came with the lamb dish. I'm Korean and I eat kimchee almost everyday. However the kimchee tasted a little different with a bit more sesame oil. As for the lamb, it was good but it wasn't the best lamb we have had. Miso cid was good but it wasn't amazing. I thought it was priced very high but it seemed normal for SF restaurant. The service was good and attentive but expected for high priced dishes.

The House knows how to deliver. Well, I don't know if they do home deliveries, but the chef sure knows how to deliver on my plate!!!! The flavors used on the Chilean seabass are pleasing to the palate. I especially love the grilled scallops. Crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside. This is a tiny restaurant, so be sure to make reservations. Otherwise you'll be waiting for at least an hour. Parking is also a doozy. Outside of that, The House is a must for anyone visiting SF!!!

The House is consistently one of the best Asian Fusion restaurants in SF. The food is great, and it's great spot for a dinner date.My favorite dishes are the deep-fried salmon roll appetizer, grilled sea bass, flatiron steak with wasabi noodles, and pork chop. The salmon is incredibly tender and cooked perfectly medium rare. The grilled sea bass is their signature dish, you can't miss it. The fish is so soft, and the sauce is incredibly flavorful. If you get the steak, definitely don't get it cooked further than medium rare. I've had it both medium and medium rare and it makes a huge difference. Lastly, the pork chop is incredibly tender on the inside, with a nice char on the outside.Their specials are also a highlight! Parking is a nightmare in this area. Definitely get a reservation or you'll be waiting 45 minutes on most nights for dinner. Luckily, you can leave your phone number if you're a walk-in and they'll text you when your table is ready :)

Trust me and eat the following incredible dishes: grilled octopus appetizer ($16), grilled sea bass and garlic noodles ($31), and coconut creme brulee with passionfruit glaze ($9).You'll be too engrossed in your dishes to notice the other patrons sitting millimeters away in the cramped space or to be angry about North Beach's lack of parking.

Asian Fusion can be a hit or miss, but this tiny little restaurant in North Beach turns out some tasty dishes. Reservations definitely make things easier, but walking in for dinner on a Friday evening, our group of four got a table right away--just before the restaurant filled up! While the decor is nice, the place is definitely cramped, so be prepared to bump elbows.We started with the deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese mustard sauce--the salmon was partially cooked and the rolls were beautifully presented. They went so nicely with the slightly spicy sauce on the side. The scallops (a special on the appetizer menu) were fried and served with a tasty sauce, but some of the coating was burnt and there was a slight bitter tinge to them. The homemade shrimp and chive dumplings were tasty, though I didn't find them all that memorable. While the appetizers were decent, I think the main course dishes are really the ones to come for!First, we had the wasabi noodles with flatiron steak, dressed with cucumber and kimchi. The steak was cooked to a perfect, tender medium-rare, but the noodles were a miss for me--they were too garlicky and didn't have much other flavor (certainly none of the wasabi flavor I was expecting). My favorite dish overall was the seared ahi tuna--the middle of the tuna was still rare, and the slices were so tender. The tuna came with rice and strips of taro, along with a spicy mustard aioli--combining all of these components yielded perfect bites of contrasting textures (soft and crunchy) and amazing flavor! While my favorite dish overall was the tuna, by far my favorite protein from the menu was the sea bass (which came with a garlic ginger soy sauce)--seared to perfection and so soft, buttery, and flavorful--this was some of the best bass I've ever tasted!Overall, I found the dishes here very creative, and the entrees were especially memorable. The dishes here are definitely pricey for what you get, but many of them were executed so well and were so tasty. Though I'm not in a rush to come back, the House is worth a visit if you're in the area!

Such an amazing restaurant tucked away in the city. I would say this is an awesome date spot, as the restaurant is cozy and very intimate. The inside is not too big and not too small, and the food is absolutely amazing. I had a great experience while I was here. I would recommend calling in for reservation beforehand, so you can get a table. It can get pretty packed in the evenings around dinner time. They have small plate and entree options. We decided to order two small plates and an entree and share everything. We started with a daily special that the waiter recommended, which was poke with beets and rice crackers on top. It was incredibly flavorful and had a hint of citrus/ spicy taste, which complemented the fish well. For our second small plate, I had the unagi, which was SO GOOD. I absolutely love unagi, and it came baked and was placed on top of rice. The rice was seasoned and had this magical sauce mixed on top, which made it taste so good. For the entree, we ordered the pork chop, which was cooked just right. Not only was the pork chop itself good, but the potatoes on the side were just amazing. I'm not sure how you can make something simple as mashed potatoes taste good, but these potatoes were top notch.Overall, awesome food and dining experience. I will definitely be back if I am ever in the city.

I recently moved to San Francisco not too long ago and a friend suggested this place. I was looking for the top places to eat in San Francisco so I gave it a go. We made reservations because we heard it gets really packed on the weekends. Before I went to The House, I looked it up on yelp to see what kind of food they served. It looked like Asian fusion that looked more upscale.My thoughts and ratings: FIRST IMPRESSION: 2 StarsThe place is kind of hidden. I abruptly stopped walking because our friend knew where the place was. The restaurant looked kinda out of place. The inside was much smaller than I had expected. It looked like a small Pho restaurant (viet noodle restaurant). It was very cramped and claustrophobic. For upscale food, the restaurant itself looked very casual.SERVICE: 3 StarsRight when we got into the restaurant, we told the servers that we had reservations. Now, I have worked in various restaurants with reservations. You could immediately tell they did not have us planned to dine with them even though we called and made reservations. So guess what they did? Cleaned up a corner table that recently left and then sat us there. There were 5 of us and it was super cramped. Was not happy about it but hey, we got a table. Rest of the service was average and the food came out quickly. I think they need to train their servers on pouring bottled beer into a glass. The server had no idea how to pour the beer into a glass. It was 70% foam in the glass. We had two beers and she poured both of them like it was wine. Not really impressed.FOOD: 5 StarsOh Em Gee. The food was bomb! We ordered the salmon roll, seabass, salmon, pork chop, and the cod. The food looked so delicious and it tasted even more delicious. My favorite was the cod with slanted sliced sushi rolls. The food was very flavorful and really well presented. I was really happy about the food.OVERALL THOUGHTS: 4 StarsThe restaurant was cramped and it did not match the upscale look of the food they were serving. The service was average and nothing to really rave about. They had wine bottles by the cash register which was... odd. My view of the restaurant where I was sitting was the cash register and the kitchen right behind it. Not exactly the type of view I would want while eating great food lol I wasn't very far from it either. It didn't have any ambiance. This restaurant is more of a, "eat your food and then go" type of place. I felt like I couldn't really stay and enjoy the company I had. The only thing that saves this place is the food. Nothing more. If you're looking for a place to just have bomb Asian fusion food, this is definitely the place! Definitely coming back for the food only!

My son who lives in SF picked this out and made reservations. The place was unassuming and the food was spectacular. We started with 2 apps - the salmon roll and octopus. My wife was sure she want having either when we ordered and even she was amazed by bother the presentation and the flavor. Must try for sure. My wife and daughter split the kale salad and it was good but that it was warm threw them off. We ordered 3 entries and all were amazing- salmon, halibut ahi tuna. Can't recall the various base sauces but OMG, trust the chef and enjoy! Truly a place I'd visit again next trip to visit my son, and he commented that he'd definitely be back to try other menu items. Visitor or local, a must try restaurant.

We walked in on a weeknight around 6:30 p.m. and had a 20-30 minute wait. You're able to venture out and about since they text you once your table is ready.Things we ordered:Soft Shell Crab - This was the perfect appetizer! You get a full soft shell crab, fried with wonton noodles sticking up and a flavorful sweet but spicy dipping sauce. Grilled Sea Bass - This was cooked perfectly and came with spinach and some fried udon noodles! Kurobuta Pork Chop - This was our favorite dish of the night! The pork chop was cooked to medium and it was juicy and so flavorful with the pomegranate currant sauce. I would recommend this dish out of the three we ordered! Service was great and I'd recommend you check out The Baked Bear afterwards for dessert.

Went here for date night, and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here! Portions are generous, and they allow for easy sharing!Service was very nice! I'd recommend trying to get a reservation if you're under more of a time crunch, otherwise the wait seems to average ~1 hour. They text you when your table is ready though, so you can be free to walk around the area and explore SF for a bit while you wait, which helps pass the time. Environment is very cozy, nice for dates. We ordered the special scallops, the sea bass (popular item it seems) and the special mahi mahi dish with California roll. Scallops: Super tender and flavorful! Pretty plate :) would recommend! Sea bass: So much good flavor! A little oily but honestly worth getting since it's so tasty. Plating was standard, but 5/5 on flavor. Mahi mahi: Beautiful plating, and unique serving of California roll. Made it taste better since it looked so unique! Almost like a CA roll cut longways. Fish was so so (sea bass was much better in comparison) but overall a lovely dish as well!

For a restaurant as popular as the House, it was surprisingly easy to get a reservation. I think I must have called them on a Tuesday and was able to get a reservation for 5:30pm on Saturday.We got the pork chop, sea bass, and garlic noodles. There was no part of the meal that disappointed.The pork chop is the best pork chop that I've ever had in my life. A lot of pork chops that I've had have been dry and tough, but the pork chop here is moist and soft. This was my first time ever having sea bass, and I think I'm ruined for life. It was so soft, flakey, and buttery. The garlic noodles was a good pairing, as having the sea bass by itself may not have been enough food. Everything had a great flavor, and was not bland or too salty. Perfect balance!We left a little lighter in our pockets, but full in our bellies. Very reasonably priced. I would definitely come back here and probably order the same thing.

The House is a small, cramped, and packed restaurant that primarily serves Asian style seafood dishes. Even with 7pm dinner reservations on a Saturday night, I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to open up for two. The waiter recommended the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy so that's what I ordered. The fish was cooked perfectly tender and meaty. The side of Garlic Ginger Soy Sauce was flavorful and the perfect compliment to the fish. However, the sauce was a little on the salty side.

If you plan on eating here, make reservations a few days in advance. The restaurant is small and super high in demand. We had a party of 8 and they gave us 1.5 hrs to eat. I am not sure if the time is based on your party size or a 1.5 hr is the norm for all customers. The closest parking garage is about 2 blocks down on Columbus & Kearny St. I paid $18 for 2 hours. If u prefer to go the cheaper route (parking on the streets), give yourself 15-20min to find one. It is SF and the area stays busy. Now on to the food! The hype is REAL! LOVED the food! I highly recommend the Salmon Rolls for appetizers. I absolutely loved the texture of the Salmon with the crisp of frying the roll. They serve it with a wasabi sauce/salsa. I don't recommend dipping the roll in the sauce unless u absolutely love wasabi. Wasabi has a very particular taste and overdoing it can really ruin the taste of the roll. For dinner, I had the Wild Rice Mushroom Prawns and the Iron Steak with Wasabi Noodles. The Wild Rice Mushroom with Prawns was amazing. If you love comfort food, this would be the dish to get. It was a very unique dish and I've never had anything like it before. Really good though. The Steak w/ Wasabi Noodles I LOVED! The steak was cooked to perfection, so juicy and tasty. I loved the thick noodles mixed with wasabi sauce, sesame and cabbage. The House offers a lot of fresh ingredients mixed with the right amount of spices which compliments every dish. On your next trip to SF, bookmark "The House". They will not disappoint.

Yo, is the food infused with crack or something? Because I'm addicted! I've enjoyed many memorable dinners at this tiny restaurant over the years and it still remains one of my favorites in the city. I typically hate cooked fish with a passion, but will voraciously scarf down the sea bass here. It's THAT good, guys! I'm also a noodle junkie, and the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles make me go crazy! In fact, I don't even talk to my dining companion when I'm eating here - I'm too busy burying my face in the glorious food and munching away. If the scallop starter special is available, GET IT! It'll make you go OOOOOOOOFF!!!!! The salmon rolls are delicious as well. Actually, everything is good so just order the entire menu!

Oh my god! I don't even know where to start, such a great experience we went 5 min after they open for dinner so we didn't need to wait which was awesome! Service was A 1, new plates and utensils after every new dish came out, love places that does that. The House really makes you feel just like home, it's like at a corner and the place is small and lovely. The outside design of the restaurant has like a Dr.Seuss theme. We ordered the Selected Oysters On The Half Shell served with spicy cilantro mignonette, Grilled Sea Bass served with garlic ginger soy, Warm Wasabi House Noodles served with Angus Flatiron Steak, Seared Hokkaido scallops, lemon ponzu, micro greens.Seared Hokkaido scallops, lemon ponzu, micro greens: This comes with 3 Hokkaido scallops but it's perfectly made with great flavors, definitely recommended!Oysters On The Half Shell served with spicy cilantro mignonette: it was good and fresh, love the sauce, it has a bit is spiciness and sweet, but overall it was the best oyster I had!Warm Wasabi House Noodles served with Angus Flatiron Steak: The steak was so delicious and made perfectly, we requested it to be medium rare and it was so good, the noodles was very good as well, I think they make the noodles fresh themselves there.Grilled Sea Bass served with garlic ginger soy: The grilled sea bass was made so perfectly that when I took a bite it melts in your mouth with so much flavor and the dipping sauce they made for the sea bass made it extra special!Overall it was a great experience and great food, definitely coming back again!

I desperately wanted to love this restaurant but left slightly disappointed. The space is small but cozy, and service was very attentive and warm. I would give the restaurant 5 stars except for an issue with one of the dishes. Ordered the deep-fried salmon roll, unagi sandwich, and udon noodles. The salmon roll was AMAZING and probably one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. The roll itself is quite simple, but when you dunk the roll in the spicy mustard sauce, magic happens. Spicy feels all over in the good way. I tried udon noodles and was impressed at how clean and simple, yet deep and complex, the broth was. The chicken didn't end up over cooked which is always a worry in hot soups. The unagi avocado sandwich was the major disappointment for me. I'm a lover of unagi anything, and was looking forward to it based on the rave reviews. But the concept of the dish is flawed - it treats the luscious unagi like deli sliced ham and crams it between thick bread and lettuce. Between the bread, tomato, and avocado, the eel got incredibly lost and the whole sandwich tasted like just a mushy sandwich. The salmon roll will keep be coming back during my future trips to SF, next time I'll just avoid the unagi and try something else.

Easy reservation process. Great service. Food was outstanding!I got the warm wasabi house noodles with steak. Definitely recommended. It wasn't too spicy and the steak was cooked perfectly. They also gave us a small app plate to start which we really appreciated because we were so hungry at that point. Thank you for a great experience for our first time in San Francisco!

Was recommended by a friend. He had spoken very highly of The House, and he was correct. The ambiance is pleasant, the wait staff is great and friendly, and the food was great, both presentation and taste.Would definitely go back next time I visit San Francisco and would definitely recommend to locals and tourists.

Pretty good, overall I would rate The House as more of a 3.5, but I made reservations about a month in advance for two at 7pm and got seated near the back of the restaurant. I was not happy about that. I also really wanted to try their Miso Black Cod, but then the waiter told me they had just run out. Again, not pleased so 3 stars it is.My friend and I ordered their 1) Deep-fried salmon roll, chinese hot mustard and 2) One of their special/off the menu small dishes that consisted of Dungeness crab on crackers as appetizers. The Deep-fried salmon roll, chinese hot mustard was probably my favorite dish out of all the things we ordered. I would give 4 stars for that dish alone. The Dungeness crab one was okay.For my main entree I ordered their Mahi Mahi special (Again, off the menu) and my friend ordered the Grilled ahi tuna, spicy mustard aioli. My Mahi Mahi was on the dry side and a bit bland. I had a taste of my friend's Grilled ahi tuna too, which was good but nothing spectacular.Extremely small restaurant. Nice service. Overall I was underwhelmed and disappointed with the food, given the high ratings on Yelp. Not sure if I would want to come again.

Went to this restaurant based off of Yelp reviews: and it did not disappoint. Food was some of the best I have ever tasted. The service was extraordinary. The restaurant itself is very small and they don't have air conditioning. When we went tonight the temp outside was in the 80s and it felt the same temp or hotter in the restaurant. However, the food and service made the temperature bearable. My only suggestion to them is to invest in a few ceiling fans to move air around on the hot days. Definitely don't miss this place while in Chinatown or San Fran.

Had dinner here on Sunday night and even with reservations, had a little bit of a bit. Based on our experience, here's what you need to know:- Make a reservation. After you check-in with the hostess, be sure you're there to hear when your name is called. It was super busy that night and I overhead the hostess tell someone waiting that another group had taken their table when their name was called. - Look at the menu before sitting down. If you're anything like me, you'll be hungry by then and not want to waste precious time looking at the menu for the first time. - Listen to everyone else and order the deep-fried salmon roll, sea bass and wasabi noodles. They are favorites here for a reason. I had the sea bass over wasabi noodles while my bf had the noodles with steak. So good! We also really enjoyed the octopus.

I've been here about 3 times, all for dinners. I highly recommend calling them to make a reservation. They don't have an OpenTable or anything.I've ordered:1. Tuna tartare2. Shrimp and Chive Dumplings3. Deep-fried salmon rolls4. Grilled sea bass5. Wasabi noodles w/ flatiron steakI think that you can't go wrong ordering the grilled sea bass or the wasabi noodles. Those seem to be the dishes that people recommend the most, and there is a reason for it. The wasabi flavor in the noodles is not strong. The sea bass is always cooked perfectly. I tried the salmon rolls twice. It is served with a Chinese mustard sauce. I think it is worth trying once, but I don't have a strong urge to order it again. The dumplings are dumplings. Did they taste good? Yes, but I don't think I would order them again. I would want to try something else. The tuna tartare is always good.This place is pretty small, and there are a ton of tables. Be prepared to basically eat on top of your table neighbors. Given the size of the place, I don't think this place would be good for large parties. The service can be a hit or a miss. There have been times that I have gone and service has been excellent. There have also been other times that I have gone and the service was meh with a lot of attitude. Given everything, I would come back. I think that the prices can be a bit steep for the portion that you get, but the food is always tasty and well executed.

I find that Asian Fusion is a difficult cuisine to pull off, but The House is one of the select few that are able to nail it. With the exception of the apple pie (which isn't really Asian anyway), I was delighted by everything that we ordered. Each dish brought its own unique flavors and textures to the table. Even though Yelp lists this restaurant as triple $$$, I must say that that the prices here are very reasonable.I would, however, suggest that the folks running this place hire an interior decorator. The dining room is cramped and the furnishing is boring. They need to swap those paintings out for some ornaments that are exotic as their food. Maybe even a disco ball? Anything to spice things up a notch!// Deep-fried salmon roll, chinese hot mustard ($11) - 4 stars// Grilled unagi, avocado sushi rice, shaved bonito ($13) - 4 stars// Grilled octopus, tempura potatoes, Sriracha aioli ($14) - 4 stars// Warm kale salad, pt. reyes blue, toasted pistachio ($11) - 5 stars// Grilled sea bass, garlic ginger soy ($30) - 4 stars// Warm wasabi house noodles, angus flatiron steak ($23) - 4 stars// Daily Special: Ribeye, mashed potatoes, caramelized cauliflower ($35) - 4 stars// Apple crumb pie ala mode ($8.50) - 3 stars// Coconut creme brulee, passionfruit puree ($7) - 5 starsA couple quick notes on the food. The salmon rolls and sea bass both came with sauces that had very pronounced flavors. If ever you order these dishes (and I'm sure most of you will due to their popularity), avoid the urge to douse them. Also, the daily special ribeye included some pretty subpar mashed potatoes. I think that a few other entrees are also served with this side, but perhaps you could try getting it swapped out for something else.

Updated review
Having been here a second time, this 5-star review is needed to be written. Location/Ambience: North Beach being as diverse as it is--food-wise, socially--this Asian-Fusion restaurant fits right in. Tucked between bars, culture, upbeat energy, The House is a perfect place to wind-down for a glass of wine and dinner, have a date, take a friend who's seeing SF for the first time. Limited seating, sure, but dynamic in said aspects. Food: Had the Teriyaki Ribeye twice, with the second time having tasted like the first. Flavorful. Presentation. Very reasonably priced for a steak its size and taste. Deep Fried Salmon Roll was the perfect appetizer. DELISH. I've tried the Seabass before and that was also a pleasure to have on the palette. The dessert with the coffee ice cream, truffle, and coconut cream was the cherry on top. My taste buds are--til this day--thanking me for having ordered such. I tell them, "Don't worry little taste buds, we'll be back for more." Lastly, tried their Ozeno Yukidoke IPA: among my favorite IPA's to date. Citrus notes, Simcoe hops (but not TOO hoppy tasting for those who prefer otherwise), tasty, tasty, tasty.)Service: A1 all around. Attentive and informative. They deserve lots of credit. Great job House Team. Save further review reading and go head and reserve a table here. It's a great spot. Love it.

OVERALL: *Recommend making a reservation, though not a must*Highly recommend the Kurobota Pork Chop and Mushroom Rice w/ Grilled Prawns and Shaved BonitoI booked a reservation here about 3 weeks ahead of time for a party of 8 for 7:30PM - my family and I got here at 7:30 and the table was all set for us. Definitely recommend making a reservation if you have a larger party, or anything in general, since this place is quite a small establishment and quite popular even on a Monday! We came for my college graduation dinner, and I've got to say, I'm happy I chose this place. There's something for everyone (except I wouldn't recommend this place for vegans / vegetarians) - mostly known for their seafood, their pork chop was also AMAZING. [FOOD]1) Mushroom Rice with Truffle and Prawns (6/5) - This absolutely blew my mind away!! My mom and I were in heaven with this dish and that says something because my mom's taste buds are sooooo picky. The truffle taste wasn't too overwhelming, but perfectly there and the rice wasn't overlooked nor undercooked. I loved the bits of vegetables mixed in, as it added more texture and substance to the dish. 2) Sea Bass (4/5) - Many fellow Yelpers love this dish, and I could see why. The sea bass was perfectly soft, smooth, and moist. Dip it into the sauce, and it was A+. My only gripe are that the noodles and the beans that came along with it weren't "OMG" but just a "Oh, that's good too". 3) Pork Chop with Cranberry Sauce (5/5) - My second favorite dish here - the pork Chop was cooked to perfection, so moist! The cranberry sauce added the perfect amount of sweetness to bring this dish to a whole new level. Must get!4) Salmon Deep Fried Roll (3/5) - It wasn't anything too spectacular; salmon itself tends to be a bit dry. Dipped in the sauce, it was filled with flavor. [DESSERT]5) Blackberry Crumble Pie (5/5) - Yesssss!! My favorite dessert here. I don't know what it is about this; normally, I'm not a fan of Pie, but I think the crumble complemented the mushiness/softness of how a fruit pie usually tastes. I can't say the blackberry taste was very strong as there was also apple or something (I can't remember). 6) Chocolate Macadamia Tart (3/5) - This was okay.. the chocolate macadamia tart part wasn't anything spectacular. The coffee ice cream went well with the chocolate, and it was definitely very chocolatey. I can't seem to describe the texture though 7) Coconut Creme Brulee (4/5) - I think the sugar also has some lime, which some people in my family thought was odd since it wasn't exactly mixed into the dessert, but just a "BAM! sour!" The coconut part was very smooth, and not too overwhelmingly coconut if that's a concern [PARKING] Parking can be a pain, especially in SF. There are plenty of street parking around, although difficult to find an open spot. I did see a parking lot sign right next to the restaurant though. [SERVICE]they have specials of the night, and the waitresses and waiters were all very friendly. They switched out our plates and utensils after appetizers, and were sure to fill up our water cups promptly.

This is probably one of my favorite restaurant places in San Francisco. Although i'm not much of a seafood person, I really love ordering the sea bass (instead of steak) with the wasabi noodles. The noodles - very thick, with hints of sesame, and a slight spicy touch to it - really complemented the sea bass. The sea bass had such a rich flavor to it. The fish was very tender (almost as if it melted in your mouth) and this became my favorite meal at the house.As for service and ambiance, I was pretty satisfied. The waiters and waitresses are dressed up and there's dim lighting which makes this a great date spot!

I've come here twice, and both times have been perfect. For starters, we've tried the scallops and the sashimi plate - highly recommend. Entree on visit one: the truffled rice with grilled prawns - my mouth waters just thinking about it. The dish was extremely rich with the truffle flavor, topped with what seemed to be living truffles, and infused with a cheese that lightly glued everything together. The prawns were grilled to perfection - and they were huge! I had enough for two servings. The second time I came, I had the salmon in a miso type broth, and again - it couldn't have been better. The broth was light, bright, and flavorful, and the salmon was tender, flaky, and dare I say, "moist"? Sorry to those of you who hate that word, but there isn't an appropriate alternative. Juicy is too much - salmon is not "juicy."Make a reservation if you want to come here, as this place gets pretty crowded on a nightly basis.

Made a reservation two weeks ago for today, Friday, at 7pm to take two guests from out of town to what should be one of the cool/unique restaurant experiences in SF. Come 4pm, am surprised to have not heard from them to confirm the reservation. Call them to confirm and am told that the reservation was canceled by text yesterday.They claim the reservation could not have been canceled except by text message reply. I can absolutely guarantee that I did *not* receive any text message from Yelp (who apparently manages their reservations) or the restaurant.Given the glitch on their side, with their reservation management system, I should still have a reservation right? They should do something to accommodate us and our guests? Nope. They didn't even apologize; just said they had no tables for us but we could come in at at 5:30p (an hour from the time of the call) or at 9p (well after reservation time, and too late to make the show we have tickets for afterwards).The woman on the phone showed zero empathy for the position she put me in with my guests. I know this is a small and popular place, and they will be sold out for months to come on busy nights, but that doesn't mean they should not treat their customers well.TL;DR they canceled my reservation of two weeks with no notice and no real offer to make it up to me. Will never (try to) go here again. And no thanks to Yelp either, who apparently texted the wrong person or otherwise canceled my reservation (according to the restaurant!).

North Beach is full of great restaurants, The House is right up there. I agree with most other reviewers in their praise.My wife and daughter went tonight. We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation. Our server clearly explained the specials. We had soft shell crab and the poke appetizer. For the main course we had wasabi noodles, sea bass and rib eye. All were perfect. We noticed other dinners sharing. That would be a good idea as the tastes are varied. It is hard to go wrong here.

Came by for lunch the other day and it was an excellent experience, as usual. Managed to be seated upon arrival, shortly after opening. Parking in North Beach is challenging at best with limited street parking. There are plenty of spots at Portsmouth Square Garage in Chinatown though.Meal started off with a complimentary pickled cucumber which had a slight kick to it. Very good.Moved on to the famous Salmon Roll and it was perfect although it was a smidget fried over medium-rare today. The wasabi dipping sauce was excellent!The soft shell crab special appetizer was also excellent. Soft shell crab was lightly battered and fried. The cold noodles complemented this dish nicely. They also use a couple edible sticks to add some flair to this unique dish!The unagi avocado sandwich was also a hit, especially with the light side salad with a pepper finish! Slices of sourdough bread sandwich a huge pieces of juicy unagi, avocado, tomato, and lettuce. Definitely a unique dish.Service by the staff was prompt and friendly.~$24/head after tax and gratuity for lunch. Seating is "cozy."

The food is fabulous - fresh, creative, delicious! The grilled octopus appetizer was so tender, the best I've had anywhere. I got the hamachi special, and highly recommend it. Next time, I'm going to get either the halibut or the sea bass (with garlic noodles). Go early if you can, and reservations are a necessity.

This tiny restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and very unique array of fusion dishes. But it is TINY. More likely than not, you will have to wait close to an hour to be seated. The portions here are surprisingly very good for a "fancy" restaurant. I've been quite satisfied both times i've been at the House. The fish here is delicious. They are cooked superbly. But if you are adventurous , you should try the beef steak with noodle. It is very unique in ingredients with kimchi, american bbq sauces, and a tinge of spiciness. The appetizers are delicious so be sure to try one of those while you are here. Everything here is a bit on the pricy end but you are definitely getting the whole package by dining here. If you have a specifically occasion that you are celebrating this is a great spot to visit. The ambience, the food, the service, and location are all very good for a great night out!

Given the plethora of 4 to 5 star reviews, I didn't think it was necessary for me to write another. But damn, after my meal last night, The House has easily become one of my favorite restaurants. We called around 7:30 to see if we could make reservations for two, and they told us they could take us at 8. I was pleasantly surprised since it was a Friday night and this restaurant is always packed. We got in a bit late due to the lack of parking around the area but we were still seated within 20 minutes. When we sat down, waters were brought to us almost immediately and our server told us about the specials that they had that weren't on the menu. I settled on the sea bass ($31) while my boyfriend had the wasabi noodles with flat iron steak ($24). O M G the sea bass was the best cooked fish dish I've ever had! It came with mini string beans and noodles - I don't know what kind of noodles they were, but I just know that it was full of flavor. Everything was insanely delicious and the sea bass paired perfectly with the sauce and literally melted in my mouth with every bite. I've had the wasabi noodles in the past and they're also very flavorful while the steak is always cooked to perfection. I wish I could've ordered small dishes/appetizers to try since our main dishes were so good but there's always next time. The entrees are decently priced for the portions given. I noticed they have a huge selection of wines as well - also a plus. Everything was fantastic and I can't wait to go back! Tip: Reservations are a must since it's a smaller restaurant. There's also a parking lot in Chinatown not too far from the restaurant if you can't find street parking.

Last Thursday night, around 7:30, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner without making a reservation. We tried calling in to make a reservation the whole day, but it kept leading to voicemail. But luckily, we were seated instantly when we arrived. It's a small and intimate restaurant with very dim lighting to set the mood. The tables are kind of close together and the atmosphere was pretty loud. Trying to find parking in Chinatown is a miracle so good luck! Anyways, the meal. We had ordered the unagi appetizer (grilled unagi over avocado sushi rice), the warm wasabi house noodles with flatiron steak and a special halibut dish with mashed potatoes. Unfortunately, I only have a picture of the appetizer... I was too hungry to take a picture of the entrees. The food came out pretty quickly and the service was very nice and attentive. The total came to be around $70-$80. I only took one star off because of how we couldn't call to make a reservation the entire day. Other than that, everything else was great!

Been here for lunch several times and never disappoints. The lunch menu has a few, slightly cheaper options than dinner (e.g. several under $20). Service is always attentive and friendly. Fave appetizers are salmon roll and tempura green beans. What I love about the salmon roll is that the salmon is cooked medium which keeps it nice and juicy. Go to entree is the wasabi noodles with the king salmon. The king salmon is absolute perfection - buttery and juicy - unlike so many other places that just overcook their salmon. The grill adds a smokey flavor. The seabass is another buttery fish option that doesn't disappoint.

I love Asian fusion and this place did. not. disappoint.The House is a small and cozy restaurant - tip: if it's your first time, you might miss it! It's on a slant and it's next to a bunch of pubs so if you go at night be on the lookout for the entrance.We were seated quite right away even though we didn't have reservation (it was a party of 2). I would say if it becomes more than 2-3 people though, make sure to have reservation. It's packed starting Thursday/Friday night.We had the salmon roll, wasabi noodles, and ahi tuna. They were all perfect. One personally tip is that if you visit the House, you MUST get the crunchy salmon roll. It is a must. As small as the restaurant is, the server is friendly and the food is perfect. Absolute recommend in the big city of San Francisco.

Bye-bye five-star rating.Finally taking one star off because of cramp, dark accommodations. Our party of five at table meant for four. End seat inches from next table. Can hear everything they are saying. Hope they are neat eaters. Don't want to find food bits in my hair or on my leather coat. Btw, the adjoining table is a table of three stuffed into table for two. I wish they had stuck to the larger Sunset location and closed this closet instead.Quality and taste of food not as we remembered either. Sea bass and black cod not taste and texture we've enjoyed in the past. Pork chop much smaller, no longer thick cut and tasted like Chinese style Cha Siu, BBQ pork. Sauces way overdone..too sweet, too salty, etc. Not the umami flavors we used to love about this place.Another star off for faking us out about coffee. Sold us on coffee being from Caffe Trieste and was French press. Did not mention not fresh French Press, but split leftover coffee from previous customer so my sister and I each got half a cup of lukewarm coffee that tasted watered down. So sad to see decline of this place. Fighting traffic and difficult parking to eat here no longer worth it. We typically spend about $300 for dinner here. We will be looking for new go-to restaurant.

I will come back to this restaurant every time I visit San Francisco. It is hands down one of the best Asian fusion restaurants I have ever been to. The food is unique and amazing quality. I ordered the miso cod and my boyfriend had the ahi tuna. We also had the ahi tuna tartare to start. The shop itself is quite small so I'd recommend making a reservation, especially if you plan on going on the weekend. I've been here three times and ordered something new each visit and I am continually impressed. The dessert is fantastic too. Do not hesitate to come here, the high ratings are accurate!

(4.5 stars) The House is freaken awesome, especially for a late lunch when it's not too crowded and the prices are super reasonable. (Under $15 for a filling and great salmon and wasabi noodles dish right in San Francisco, seriously?!) Everything we had on the menu was well worth ordering again. The best, hands down, was the sesame soy glazed king salmon. Though a bit pricier than the rest of the lunch options, the intense yet not overbearing teriyaki flavor that they are able to infuse with the salmon is mesmerizing. I usually find that salmon is almost always good, but rarely phenomenal because it's a relatively lackluster fish to start with. But for anyone who enjoys a great fish, this is a must. It's beautifully plated treasure for anyone who orders it.The warm wasabi house noodles (which I got with chicken instead of salmon and that was a mistake!because the chicken came with the skin on it) was also a great option. It wasn't too spicy and the noodles and flavors were so unique. Next time, which there surely will be, I'm sticking to the salmon.
