We went to a nearby bar to celebrate my roommate's birthday and when everyone bounced, we made our way naturally to get pizza!I'm so glad Golden Boy was a 1-minute walk away from that bar or else we would've ended up at some mediocre pizza joint. When we arrived, like any tasty place in SF, there was an expected line on the sidewalk. I like lines, I can reflect on life or really debate on which pizza to get. I ended up doing the latter.My beau ordered some green pizza with clams on it and I opted for a combo and a pepperoni. I'm the fatty in our relationship and it's ok. My other roommate also opted for two slices and she ended up reheating the second slice the next morning (I was jealous!) I wish I ordered extra for leftovers sake because it was so good!Probably my favorite pizza spot in SF!

First off, let me just say that I am extremely lactose intolerant with a ton of GI issues but for the clam pizza from Golden Boy, I would risk it ALL. I don't think I've ever had such delicious pizza in my 23 years! The flavor is amazing, it's the perfect amount of crispness, and they truly do not skimp on the amount of garlic (coming from garlic's #1 fan). I think it's a great bang for my buck as well - it's around $5 for a slice and those slices are HUGE!!!! It makes this place all the better to me. Just a few tips: prepare to wait; the lines are usually long. Also, bring cash with you as Golden Boy is cash only. I usually like to bring my pizza home to eat because the establishment is a bit small so seating is limited and it tends to get pretty hot in there. Regardless, it's SO WORTH IT. You won't regret it!

"I really don't like when things are all polished and perfect - the perfect love story and the hair is perfect." - Marisa TomeiCiao Marisa! Yup, pretty much 2,500+ reviews and a 5-stars rating says a lot about this place! It's everything a 5-stars rating should be, not boringly perfect by any means, but before I get carried away and your mind goes drifting off to shirtless golden boys dancing to relax don't do it... hey, this is a legit pizza place in North Beach, aka Little Italy! To me, and obviously many others, it's a 5-stars rating because:The Golden Boy vibe: It's old school to the core. I mean it's been on the corner of Green street since the disco days of 1978. That greasy spoon vibe, 40-years of layers of stickers on the walls, the decor that screams "original" is what's it all about. Expect old stools, dim lighting, and loud music! The Golden Boy value: I mean you could buy other things here, but it's all about the pizza, yo! The mouth watering pizza! By the slice, or by the pie, you won't stop at only one. The best part is for $5 or less you can get a killer slice of the tastiest pizza your tongue has ever touched. It's hella tasty and damn it's guido cheap too! I highly suggest at least two slices to compare, y'know what I mean, son? The Golden Boy Taste: Tell me your best pizza spot on the planet and then try a Golden Boy slice. Go ahead compare it! I do know not everyone sees pizza the same way, some take the gourmet route, some will take the freezer burn route, but if you want a legit pizza with goo and dripping everywhere, taste buds savoring every old school bite... you'll be in love. Not with little Danny, or big Tony, but you'll love your slice, home slice! Lastly, there's some unsaid "Golden Boy house rules" that are legendary to those in the area, but in all honesty it's mostly urban legend. No silly, no big ass Tony will bounce you from the place if you look at his baby sister the wrong way... we've come a long way since the guido stereotype days. Just know this... Golden Boy is CASH only, it's straight forward ordering (pointing works too), and it's no fancy restaurant, so don't expect fancy or special treatment and you'll love it! Expect a little and get a lot in return is my motto. Any slice is a good slice at Golden Boy, but if the garlic clams is available grab a slice! The everything combo is killer too! Oh my! It's 5-stars rating is not because it's perfect, but it's perfectly imperfect with hair just perfect enough...

Down home pizzeria in the heart of Little Italy. They have good beer like Lagunitas IPA and wines which I haven't sampled. The counterman running the operation was amiable & personable handling taking orders, putting squares of pizza to warm, serving beer & wine, taking care of customers with a bright smile. The pizza base here is like foccacia bread: thick, bready, chewy. Great for carb lovers. However, for me, the toppings to bread ratio is unbalanced. Four small pieces of Salsiccia Italian on a large square of pizza bread with a whisper of Salsa Marinara & glazing of mozzarella was rather austere. Combination pizza is better since there are more toppings: zucchini, tomato, onions, button mushroom, pepperoni slice, Salsiccia Italiana. But it is still a bit too carb rich. The clam & garlic pizza is enriched with more mozzarella cheese, green onion, Italian parsley. There is a creamy Besciamella like garlic undertone. But again the heavy chewy bread textures predominate. The Golden Boy pizza may be manna for carboholics, but I find that even one square slice is overly filling. 3+ Yelp stars.

I came Tuesday afternoon and there was no line! Which was perfect because I just wanted a quick snack. I had the clam and garlic and it was so flavorful! They do not skimp on the clams and garlic. It was cheesy and savory. The crust was not doughy but had a bite. And the bottom of the crust was crunchy. The staff were also friendly, so I had a positive experience here!

I walked by this a few times and kept seeing the lunch lines, and finally decided to walk in and give it a try (after carefully looking at Yelp to decide on my choice of slices of course). I ordered two slices to try on my first visit:Combo: This is a solid combo pizza. The sausages were great, and perfect ratio for toppings. I would definitely get this again.Clam and garlic: I was a bit disappointed by the clam and garlic to be honest. The flavors were decent, but not as fragrant as I would have liked - I thought they could've gone heavier on the garlic.Overall, Golden Boy Pizza is a bit pricier than I'd hope for a quick pizza lunch (likely because I needed two slices to be full), but the quality is definitely there. I love the crust, and their cheese is perfect. Perhaps reading the reviews left it a bit overhyped for me, which may explain my disappointment with the clam and garlic pizza. I will probably be back to try some of the other flavors next time, particularly the pesto veggie pizza and perhaps the sausage.

So much hype and friends' posts on other social media outlets has gotten me very curious about this place. So I placed Golden Boy on my list and took a drive out there while on a trip into town. We went in the middle of an afternoon so there wasn't a line at all. Inside, the walls are covered with stickers, postcards, graffiti and random things customers stick to their walls. The restrooms are even more insanely decorated with more of the same. (not a good place for drunk people, you might get disoriented)Only counter seats are available, on a tall stool w/o a back, so watch your little kids. The process is simple if you haven't been yet. Check out their options by the window, walk inside (or wait in line) place your order and pay. Hopefully you'll fins a seat and they'll call you when your pie is heated & ready. Like most of the people that come here, I got the clams & garlic and a combo. The c & g was a little light on taste. I had it at other places before and it was bursting with garlic flavor and had piles of clams. Golden Boy's lacked that burst of flavor and some bites lacked clams. I had to add basil and red pepper to liven things up. The combo was not terribly generous with the sausage. Both were good, but neither had me craving it when thinking back about my visit. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the great reviews and never-ending lines, but my experience gets a 3 star. I'm not ruling this place out, but will not go out of my way to come here.

Good Sicilian-style pizza! Thick, doughy slices, soft and chewy on in the inside with a little more crunch on the outside. Pretty sizable slice. They're served hot, cheese super gooey, so they're extra satisfying, but also very greasy. Delicious sober or drunk :PThe line was long on a Friday night but it moved pretty quick. Not much seating inside so we took our slices to the park nearby instead.I got a slice of the GARLIC & CLAM ($4.25), which was very garlicky! I couldn't really taste the clams (had to really think about them to notice them) but I really loved the garlic flavor. Not for anyone who's kind of iffy about garlic!They also have classic pizza choices like cheese, pepperoni, combo and pesto, all $3.25-4.25/slice

Get there early to avoid the line. That being said, this is the best late night pizza I've had. You will be assaulted with the smell of pesto, roasting clams, and rising dough in little Italy. PESTO CLAM (PC) PIZZA IS DANK This is such a hard review to write because I'm starving and thinking about this pizza is burning a hole in my heart. I miss it so much. I never had seafood on a pizza, but this was a great introduction. The pesto is not overwhelming, and compliments the clams to add a bit of freshness to the slice. I'm dreaming of a tv night with a bottle of white wine and just this pizza. If you have PC pizza you don't need a girlfriend. VEGETARIAN PIZZA WAS GOODNot as memorable as the PC, but how can you top that? The onions on this are slightly caramelized, and make this worth the trip for any veggie person. Each slice is roughly 4-5 inches squared and it's about $4.50/slice. Still, some of the best real estate I've thrown in my mouth.

I had the clam and garlic pizza, and at $4.25 a slice, it wasn't bad choice for the area. They have a display case of all the pizzas out front, and when you order one, they grab it and put it in the oven to heat it back up.Unfortunately, it does kind of taste that same way too when you eat it. The pizza lacks that super fresh taste of new pizza, and while it still is decent, it would have been better if it wasn't just mass made, reheated and just sitting out there.The flavors were interesting for the clams are garlic pizza, mostly because I enjoyed the garlic, but it didn't really stand out or have anything that really captivated me or would make me want to crave or come back here, besides the price of course.This place is cash only, so make sure you withdraw some cash before coming!

Wow. If you're in SF and in the mood for pizza, you should definitely bike up to Golden Boy for a slice or two. The clam and garlic is absolutely delicious (if you like garlic!) with perfectly combinations of crispy crust, chewy dough, and flavor-packed toppings. The ambiance is great and casual, a shotgun layout with some bar seating. Would love to come again!

Cheap, filling, delicious, and excellent service. Dare I say it possibly the best pizza by the slice in the city. The kid at the counter was super friendly and helpful and I went with 2 house specialities off their small menu the garlic clam and the pesto vegie. Now usually I always order several slices Im the guy who solos a whole frozen pizza when im at home netflixing but I felt pretty full after 1 and stuffed after the 2nd. They only serve square slices and when it came with a knife and fork I thought it was heresy at first till I quickly realized it was so loaded up was greasy dankness I would have ruined my suit halfway into the work day otherwise and it was totally justified. Both were super tasty and packing distinct flavors. Probably even better when your drunk and the place is always a cool dive bar so feel free to test my theory. Long story short what are you doing with your life? You need to be here eating this pizza!

You honestly can't go wrong exploring and eating pizza in the North Beach area and this place is no exception. Expect lines to go out the door since the place is pretty small, but it does go quickly. I enjoy that this place is dive bar-esque with its own vibe and tons of stickers lining the walls. The seating here is more stools lined up against the back wall and near the entrance so not really a sit down type of place. But it's a great place to enjoy a slice by yourself! ***CASH ONLY***FAVES: veggie, combo, and clam & garlic I originally was going to come and order 2 slices just for me, but once I saw the portions I only ended up getting one and it was perfect just for me. Slices vary between $3.25-$4.25. I enjoy that the pizza here has a nice thick crust and crunch when you bite into it. They have the right amount of toppings and cheese without it being overwhelming.The clam is a fave but it was definitely more garlic than clam. Don't get me wrong it was tasty, but I was expecting to have even portions of both ingredients. Some might get turned off by all the herbs on top but it added to its flavor for sure. If you're area definitely stop by to grab a slice, a spot by the register, and have a great conversation with the workers!

I came here on an early weekend, it was pretty packed already for a small restaurant. It was a pretty small restaurant, but the food was delicious. When I went it was already half packed, and luckily there wasn't a line. The pizza was fresh and good. I really enjoyed the "everything" pizza, it is full of flavour and packed with a lot of ingredients. I also tried their other selections, which was also good. Overall, it's a great place for a quick meal, great food, and great service.

While waiting to eat at another restaurant nearby, we passed by a huge line of people waiting for some pizza. We decided to join since we had to wait 1hr and a half for the original place we were going to eat at. Looking at reviews, people raved about the clam and garlic. I was quite unimpressed with it unfortunately. It lacked clam flavor and it was overpowered with garlic. I had 3 other people with me and we all seemed to agree it was not that good. We also ordered the sausage and cheese pizza which had just come out of the oven and that was delicious! The crust is buttery and fluffy with a little bit of crisp, and the sauce is a little sweet and tangy. Not sure if it's because it had JUST come out or if it's actually delicious. I've definitely had better pizza elsewhere, but this place is a decent place to try if you're in the area. Slices are a little overpriced though... sitting at $4+ for a relatively small rectangle.

Not NY pizza by the slice, but pretty good pizza!When some 20 years ago I left Brooklyn for San Francisco I immediately felt certain withdrawal symptoms, two top ones being that of NY bagels and NY pizza by the slice. It took me a few months to discover Golden Boy Pizza, but once I did, my shaking hands somewhat stabilized, my nerves settled and I stopped being a short tempered SOB!! I knew then that whenever I craved a slice, I could go to Golden Boy and sniff up a couple of cheese or pepperoni slices and all be fine!! Shoot, I could even do it as late (or early) as 2:30 am on Saturdays and Sundays!! Listen you fellow NYers who may read this, I still miss NY's pizza badly, the kind that you could buy at any neighborhood pizzeria, drain of grease, fold in half and swallow in four bites, but being on this side of the continent at least I have Golden Boy! So please be understanding and instead of disowning me, come and try a slice of Golden Boy Pizza and judge for yourself!

Maybe it was cause I was sober and we all know pizza tastes bomb after late night drinking. I got a slice of pepperoni and a combo both for $4 each. It was underwhelming and looks can be deceiving. In this case, it was too soft/fluffy with the dough too soft: i was expecting more with all the raving reviews. Always a line and I ended up waiting 5-10 minutes for ehhh slices. I'll come back after a few drinks next time and see if it changes the verdict.

WOW...I passed this place several times before trying it. I mainly avoided it at first because it looks like the kind of place you would get food poisoning. Well I didn't get food poisoning, I did get amazing pizza though. It is by no means gourmet pizza or a place you should go if you want to sit in quiet with your kids, but if you're out drinking and get the munchies, this is the absolute perfect place to go. The pizza is greasy, cheesy, full of flavor, and a great price. It tastes exponentially better the more you've had to drink. I cannot attest to how it tastes sober, but when I think of San Fran, Golden Boy always comes to mind as the shining binnacle of my experience here. I'd suggest getting a slice of "normal" pizza (pepperoni) and a slice of the clam. It's not as bad as it sounds.

Almost 2,500 reviews with a 4.5 rating, I was expecting some bomb ass pizza. NOPE. I left disappointed. Coming in, there was a 4-5 people line to order by the door. Really awkward placement since the line starts by the door and you have to squeeze though people to come in.The squares were less than impressive. Bland and too fluffy, barely any sauce.. I never had Cici's pizza but this is what I imagine it tastes like. The most exciting part of going to Golden Boy was the cute British bartender.I really don't have anything else to say, I could of skipped this experience all together. Well, at least now I can warn others, don't bother...

Golden Boy is so hyped up and from all the raving reviews, I had pretty high expectations. I visited around 11:30pm and there was a line out the door, but it moved pretty fast. I ordered a slice of the 'famous' clam and garlic pizza and then a slice of the combo to share with my boyfriend. There's only bar seating inside since it's a small space, but we were lucky enough to find two seats at the counter. The stools were rather small and uncomfortable and the counter was too high up. There also aren't any hooks to hang bags so I was clutching onto my bag while trying to eat my pizza and not fall off the stool at the same time. As for the pizza itself, I really didn't think it was as amazing as people say. The clam and garlic pizza looked and smelled good, but as I was eating it, I barely tasted any clam or garlic flavors. The combo pizza tasted like a less oily, less toppings, but better crusted Costco pizza. I'm sorry if that comparison offends some people (lol) but as I was eating it, that's what I was thinking. I put so much parmesan and red pepper on my pizzas but it still didn't satisfy my tastebuds. I kept thinking about adding Tabasco, tbh. At $4.25 a slice, it's pretty decently priced, but I don't think it was worth standing in line for.

The pizza here is fresh, cash only (ATM in the back). You can see all the pizzas they have available at the window. From clam & garlic, pepperoni, sausage, cheese to veggie pesto. They heat it up for you and its piping HOT! Caution: The roof of your mouth is not ready. Great for a snack - couple pieces coming out to ~8. Seating is pretty limited, bar seating with maybe about 20 seats. I really like their crust and dough, they don't have a very saucy pizza so if marinara everywhere is your thing it might seem a bit on the dryer side. The bite holds well and the toppings are pretty generous. Would definitely recommend this pizza joint to any pizza lovers roaming in this area. Round the corner of this place you'll find some great Happy Hour deals on drinks too. Pizza & Beer, need I say more.

Golden Boy is the kind of place where the length of the line makes you think it's better than it is. If you come here in the evening, be prepared to stand half an hour in line.The pizzas are made on focaccia, which is interesting but ultimately results in a very bready experience. It didn't feel like either of my slices were very cheesey or saucy. I got a slice of sausage, and a slice of clam. The clam was interesting, but I ended up wishing that I had just gotten two slices of pepperoni instead.Cash only.

There is nothing bad about Golden Boy Pizza except the fact that it is miles and miles away from where I live. Why does something so good have to be so far away? I tried combination the first time. I know, you're probably thinking...why combination. But it was the best frikken combo Pizza I've ever had and I've had a lot of combo pizzas in my life. That says something! The next time I had it, I tried the clam and garlic. Yes, yes. I made the right choice this time. There's just something about their cheese. I bit into my pizza and strings of it just gracefully formed as I pulled the slice away from my mouth. It's as if all the world stopped and it was me and my Pizza in slow motion. Nothing but angels singing. Until we meet again, golden boys!

If Sicilian Style Pizza is your thing, then I would encourage you to stop by Golden Boy Pizza in North Beach and pick up a few slices! It definitely hits the spot if you're craving a late night snack. Parking might be a bit of a hassle to find in this area, but if I'm in the mood for pizza, I'll take my chances and find a way to get here.They offer up a variety of pizza slices here. If you've never heard of Sicilian style pizza, it's basically a thick toasted square with cheese that will melt all the way through each layer. They have some great toppings like the Garlic & Clam, but I would recommend the combo slices because they fill you up quite nicely. There will be a line that you'll have to wait in, but it's no more than 15 minutes to a half an hour. Totally worth it though. There really are a lot of great Italian places to choose from, but if you're craving a quick bite, then make your way to Golden Boy Pizza and see what all the fuss is about!

Seating is very limited so I'd suggest ordering and taking your pizza while you walk. Came here with a bunch of friends after a late night at the bars. We ordered a huge sheet of the combo and it was enough to feed 10 people if not more. Great ingredients and very fluffy dough.

Get the clam and garlic. Get 5 slices. Cash only but there is an ATM in the back and a Wells Fargo just up the block if you do not want to pay a fee. Thankfully for my USAA account, I never get charged for pulling out cash which I did that day. I pulled a $20 but should have pulled $40 to satisfy my pizza cravings. Best thing: the 2 guys that helped w/ my order, got our waters, and checked on me constantly to make sure Gavin and I were cool. In. Love. I will be back this Sunday!

I honestly do not see the hype with this place. The reviews are crazy high for this cash-only place. The pizza is good and unique but not 4.5 stars good. It's really overhyped and nothing to go out of your way for. It's good but if you're going to be in Little Italy/North Beach you have a plethora of other pizza options to chose from. We got the infamous clam pizza as well as the supreme. Its pretty much pizza with some seafood on it, not something that blew me out of the water. It is a cool little place though, bar included and stickers/tagging everywhere. Really cool vibe.

Very casual joint with delicious slices of freshly made pizza served 'til late at night. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?! If only it wasn't so difficult to park in North Beach, I would be here often for a midnight snack haha.The pizzas are served in individual squares and toasted before serving to you. I'd suggest buying one slice of each and trying which one you like best. I love the veggie pesto & the combo with sausage, pepperoni, & zucchini! My friend loves the clam pizza, which looks really good if I do say so myself.Cheap too! So if you're looking for a bargain & delicious slices of pizza, head over to North Beach & pay a visit to Golden Boy!

Amazing! I'm not really one to rave about pizza, but Golden Boy is literally killing the game. They have avariety of pizzas to choose from. They are also well priced for the amount you get in a slice. I wasn't exactly sure if I was going to like it, but I was pretty pleased.I got the pesto veggie and my friend had gotten the calm pizza. My pesto veggie was amazing, the pesto flavor wasn't overwhelming the veggies. There was a small wait, about 5-6 minutes, but it went by quickly. This establishment takes cash only, but there are a ton of banks all around it. Definitely coming back!!

Probably the pie I liked most I'd say flavor wise when I was running around to different places to try for pizza. Plus the experience was awesome despite the place being really busy.I had gotten here a little before they opened, watching from the outside as the view at the window opened up for the pizzas to see. I also parked like a few blocks away on a Saturday which was probably a stroke of luck on my part.*side note: a lady saved me from being runover at the corner too, also possibly a stroke of luck. Or by proximity she didn't want blood on her, one of the two. Since they had a veggie option among the multiple pies, I grabbed that one. The size is quite good for the price, and the sauce is pesto. I'd say this would be one of the best applications of a pesto sauce I've had on a pizza since it was strong enough to be in every bite but not overpowering where you'd lose the taste of the veggies or the cheese. Plus I like a lot of pesto. If I wasn't trying a bunch of places that day, I probably would've taken one home for good measure. Maybe even a whole pie if I lived close enough. I also liked the crust for it more than the other places I went since it was thicker and had more flavor to it in comparison.I contemplated a beer and the guy at the front recommended a fieldwork ipa. Worked really well with the meal. I continued to banter with the people over beer at the front til it got really busy. Friendly, cool people. Kinda wish it wasn't so busy at times but what can you do.I'd certainly come by again for the whole experience, and hopefully when I'm not battling the crowd.

GARLIC CLAM PIZZA!!!!!! You wouldn't think it would be a thing but these culinary geniuses made it a thing and it is amazing! and they're open late! Their slices are thick and always fresh and delicious, they do not skimp on the toppings. It's also super reasonable, only $3-5 per slice depending on the toppings!CASH ONLY.

Golden Boy Pizza is my go-to for late night drunchies. The sucky part is it's only cash only. The good part is each slice is dirt cheap that in the end you feel dang rich cause you can eat two slices, feel guilty for it, but not feel guilty for breakin' the bank! $$$$$$$$$I usually order the combo or pepperoni and if I'm feeling adventurous I order the garlic clam even though I feel it's salty for my liking. The pizza comes in little squares wrapped in red and white checkered paper. Classic.The crust is on the thicker side but it's by no means a Chicago style pie. The toppings look fresh and they re-toast it in front of you before you eat. I'll always have fond memories of Golden Boy because this is the place I've taken some of my dearest friends to have a bite of North Beach.

Wandering around Little Italy, and we were actually heading to a spot a few doors down when we noticed the line outside Golden Boy. As there was no line, or signs of life where we were headed, we quickly changed plans and came here instead. Lots of locals, and we guessed (correctly) they knew something we did not. It's got that grungy bar feel (not a bad thing) with stickers plastering the walls, and about 10 bar stools total for seating. I liked the thick, bready crust as it reminded me of one of my favorite spots from the Italian immigrant-rich area of West Virginia (yes, this exists.) We had a late dinner reservation, and the slice of pizza, along with a few dim sum items from Chinatown, were perfect to tide us over from breakfast til our evening meal. The garlic and clam looked great but neither of us could pass up the pepperoni fresh from the oven.

The best place for delicious and cheap pizza in SF! I devoured three slices by myself. My favorite by far was the clam and garlic pizza. The veggie pesto was really good as well though (even though I tend to be a carnivore). They're open pretty late as well so it's good for sobering up after hitting the bar! Expect it to be busy if you go anytime between 5-9pm. Don't be upset if you have to wait in line, because it's worth it. Usually, there aren't many seats available inside so grab your pizza to go and get some gelato!

Good ol' Golden Boy Pizza, no its not owned by Oscar De La Hoya and no they don't serve in fishnets. The line was long, it took over an hour to get to the pizza. The anticipation was fun. I almost felt like I was waiting to meet the soup nazi, but thankfully the guy at the counter was a little nicer. Pizza by the slice. Squared out slices. The pizza was light in cheese, the toppings were nice and greasy, what more could a drunk man ask for? I had the pepperoni pizza and umm I forgot. How unprofessional of me. Honestly Golden Boy pizza is a must when you're on one. Its not going to suck. At worst it'll be okay. And if you're a Seinfeld fanatic you get to experience the closest thing to the soup nazi that you'll find on the westcoast...but without the soup...or the nazi.

My husband and I were quoted an hour wait at Sotto Mare. We were told our buzzer would only work in one block radius so we decided to grab a quick bite at Golden Boy Pizza which was only three establishments over. The line at Golden Boy never seemed to end. My husband and I waited about 20 mins to even get a foot in the door. We then had to intensely stalk out by the bar for a seat to enjoy our slice. We opted for their famous clam and garlic pizza. $4.25 for a slice was definitely a bit steep. Our slice came straight from the oven and the cheese was still bubbly. The flavor though was way too salty for my taste - Not much clams but loads and loads of garlics. The pizza crust was interesting - tasted as if it just dissolved in the mouth within two chews. I personally enjoyed the crust more than the toppings. Overall - glad we gave it a try but clams and garlic just isn't the dreamy combo for me.

Somehow this has become my go-to pizza place when I'm depressed. I like to get a slice and a beer and look at the stickers my ex put on the wall. Their veggie slice is hella good. If you're into seafood you definitely need to try that clam slice. I'm fine with two cheese. I love that they give you a fork and knife if you dine in - the slices are so deep and gooey. These days there is a line out the door but you get your food really quickly. I'm pretty sure it's cash only which is coo because then a lot of people leave the line to go to the ATM and you get to the front even faster.

Yo the crust on these joints is HIT. Somehow amazingly crisp yet chewy, and a great vehicle for delivering savory sauce, gooey cheese, and whatever combination of toppings you happen to be craving. I had a slice of the clam and garlic and think I saw a piece of Golden Boy Pizza heaven. In fact, it may be my go-to for returning visits!Note: this place is cash only. So bring it.

This place is next to a dive bar me and my friends frequent occasionally. One late night after drinking we decided we HAD to try the pizza (because we had the drunkchies, of course) because the pizza smelled so good and the long line made us think it actually tastes delicious too!Someone in line recommended me the garlic and clam pizza. This is NOT something I would normally request on my pizza but I figured, if people are ordering this by the whole pie, it's gotta be good! I will say, I was definitely satisfied with my purchase.Love that this place is open late night; definitely meant for after the bar and night owls. Try it next time you're out late in North Beach!

Came to Golden Boy finally after having it bookmarked for so long. Beware, this place is cash only but I think I saw an ATM in the corner. Little hole in the way mini-restaurant with some of the most amazing pizza! They sell by the slice of anything on the menu; very straight forward and simple menu. Golden Boy is decorated in edgy street-art kind of way. Inside there's about 15 bar stools and a small counter to eat at. The pizza is fresh and delicious. I'm already looking forward to the next time I can make it back to Golden Boy Pizza!Review #1 of 2017

Simply the best pizza in the Bay. Whether you stop by for a late-night slice after some drinks or you grab a whole pizza right when they open, you can't go wrong. Some people prefer thin crust, others want deep dish...Golden Boy is just right. "Straight cash homie!"

Best pizza in the world. Get a sheet, order whatever you want - our usual is 1/2 pepperoni, mushroom and olives for the hubby and my 1/2 is pepperoni, mushroom and pesto boy oh boy - the ratio to the crust to the cheese to the sauce, to the toppings...wow. Pop it in the toaster oven, we can eat this for few days and it tastes exactly like it did he first day. Hubby will actually drive to the city just for this pizza and he hates going to the city. Or if you want a quick lunch. Get a slice of a clam pizza, or veggie pesto or pepperoni. I love you Golden Boy.

I've been on the hunt for the perfect pizza in SF and I must say Golden Boy Pizza will be on my top five list . We waited in line for about 25 minutes out side in the cold while a man sang to us with his guitar . It was finally our time to pick out the pizza slices we wanted , I was sad that they ran out of the sausage pizza . We ordered one pepperoni, cheese and two combinations. I really wanted to try the pesto and clam pizza but no one was ordering it ;( The pizza was served hot, crispy and crunchy! I wish it was a little more saucy but that's ok !!! We were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar so we could enjoy our date inside instead of outside.***** CASH ONLY ******

Over the years, I've grown to like pizza less and less, because the quality of many pizzas has gone way done as its become a fast-food commodity. But Golden Boy reminded me of what good pizza can really be! Many pizza afficionados say that the dough is the most important part of the pie, and I now fully agree. The crust that Golden Boy uses is extremely similar to focaccia bread--soft, tender, yet crusty and chewy. After a short wait in line, I got a slice of the clam & garlic, which came with just the right amount of tomato sauce (not too much) and and topped with a ton of clam, parsley, and cheese (though perhaps a bit TOO much cheese for my liking). The pie had just come out of the oven and was still hot and fresh. Yes, a single slice is rather expensive, but it's definitely worth it for the amazing quality and flavor!

Pizza is my favorite food and I'm not afraid to admit it. Living in SF on-and-off for 18+ years I've seen my share of San Francisco pizza trends. Deep dish, fried eggs on top, specific 'firing temperatures' and everything in between. But Golden Boy a has been my boy since 2001 and we'll never be apart. Fun fact, I reluctantly had my first kiss here with my now husband about a decade ago post drinks sesh around 1am. It wasn't cute but turned into a life long friendship! The pizza is my everything. Combo, cheese, pepperoni, clams, get one of everything paired with beer. Rules: No kids (in my opinion, and I own a kid). Don't arrive too sober. And lastly, try to pick a little more charming place if you're looking to plant a 'first kiss' on someone.

In the midst of all the Santa Con activities, I managed to grab a bite to eat. Sure enough, Golden Boy Pizza came to my rescue.If you can look pass the long lines and their *CASH ONLY* policy, you'll come to realize that their pizzas are the best late night meals. Their pizzas are freshly made. The crust has a nice crunch. The center is warm and chewy. Incontestably their Garlic Clam pizza is the most popular dish on the menu. But the garlic overpowers the pizza that I'm always left with a pungent smelling breath. As basic as it may seem, my favorite has been their pepperoni pizza as it not as oily as most pizza joints that leave me self-loathing.

PSA: It is a nightmare trying to find parking here. Come here with one other person so someone can buy the pizza and the other have emergency lights on pulled over to a random curb. I got the clam garlic and combo pizza. Honestly, expected a lot more due to the raving reviews. It's nice that they heat up the pizza upon your order so it's fresh to eat. Clam Garlic was the better choice of the two. It wasn't overly strong on the Garlic and had just the right kick to it; the pizza was slightly bitter from the Garlic as well. They weren't skimpy on clams either. Overall, for the trouble to get these pizzas, it wasn't worth for me. It was good but probably won't return again anytime soon.

With all its glowing reviews, I was really expecting a lot from here, but unfortunately, I hyped it up for myself too much. I got to try their highly revered garlic clam focaccia pizza slice, but I found myself rather unenthused about the flavor. It was okay...not as tasty as I had anticipated. I also got to try the combination, which was just as passable as the aforementioned. I'm sure the pizza is good for soaking up the booze after a night out in North Beach, but when you're sober, the pizza isn't all that appetizing. Overall, this joint is ideal for those late nights--quick and cheap, but I know you've had better [sober]. Uh, where my Costco pizza at tho? + Beer and wine on tap+ By the sheet or the slice, eat in or take out

This place is fantastic! We tried every pizza flavor they offered and wasn't disappointed by any of them. The staff is helpful and quickly does their part to take and deliver the orders swiftly. The crust is buttery pan pizza, that absolutely melts in your mouth.This is a "walk-up" and "by the slice" pizza joint with limited seating. If you are looking for a sit-down restaurant with a large group, this likely isn't the venue for you. With that said, I'd rather order a pizza to go and eat it in the park a few blocks away. This is easily the best pizza I've had in my many trips to San Francisco!

I usually like NY style pizza, but Sicilian pies are really growing on me. There are very few ppl I trust with food suggestions and the one that suggested this place was spot on saying the clam & garlic slice was the best the west coast had to offer in terms of a Sicilian slice. The best is in NYC, duh. Clam & Garlic! Sounds like a weird combo of toppings for a pizza, right? Nope, not at all. It's delicious! Taste for yourself why it's their signature :)

HOLLY PIZZA!!! I was so excited to finally try Golden Boy Pizza! I had the chance to try this gem this weekend and let me tell you the pizza was BOMB.Like all great hole-in-the-wall type spots, it's a very small space with limited seating. We ordered at the counter after waiting 15 minutes in line but every minute was worth it!I had a hard time picking which pizza I wanted and ultimately went with the combo which was very good. The pizza is hearty and although thick, I love that the outer crust is crunchy & seasoned.One square slice of the pizza washed down with Stella on tap was more than enough for me. And to think I actually debated ordering 2 slices. This place is great for late night bite after a long night out in the bars of North Beach!Can't wait to be in the area again just so that I can grab a bite to eat here :)

One of the pizza places I've eaten in San Francisco! The line was out the door, but it moved fairly quickly. The slices reminded me of Little Cesar's since it was square, but it was nice and "fluffy" consistency to the bread which I love. Not too much tomato sauce and the cheese was just right. Seating here is limited and there are no tables. It's bar-style seating with stools. They also serve beer on-tap.Now I know why the person who suggested me to check out this place drives all the way from the East Bay just to get a slice. It's that good.

Damn that pizza is goooood! We waited in line at 2 am after the bars closed for maybe 15-20 minutes, and I would do it again and again. Holy moly. Definitely the best pizza I have had in SF, and maybe ever. I got the Hawaiian, and cheese, and it melted in my mouth like no other. It was 4 bucks a slice, so pretty reasonable too. There is going to be a wait, but if you are looking for some awesome pizza, Golden Boy is a golden move. You gotta do it!

I come here often and don't have any problems but came here Sat afternoon, and got regular cheese and pesto veggie pizza. Regular cheese was fine and delicious and fresh but the pesto was soggy and old. It was from last night I'm pretty sure. The side crust had the consistency of last night leftover pizza for lunch. Veggies were passed out. It smelled funny.It has made my stomach upset. Please don't sell old pizzas. Maybe owner does not know about it or maybe he is the one who told them to do that, why loose regular customers (to bad stomach and pizza) for so little gain...?

If you want some delicious pizza, go here. I stumbled upon Golden Boy Back in 2014 and have been going here every time I'm in San Francisco. The pizza slices are big squares filled with flavor. My favorite is the combo or sausage pizza. I recently went here with my mom and we ordered two sausage slices and one pepperoni slice. My mom ordered a beer and they gave her a different sample of beer so she could try them. The workers were very helpful and nice. The atmosphere of this place is great, especially if you go at night. They are open late and only accept cash. This is my favorite place to get pizza and hangout. The ambiance is lively. The bathroom and walls are filled with a variety of cool stickers. Definitely make a stop here when you are in the area!
