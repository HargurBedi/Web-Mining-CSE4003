Super authentic Italian food. It's all fresh and smells delicious. There is no wonder why there is always a line almost out the door.Seating is unfortunately cramp. PSA: stand in line and order. By the time you pay, a table should have freed up.Side note - I don't like that everything is disposable. It's extremely wasteful, but I understand that the business probably doesn't have space for someone to bus and wash dishes as well.Food = amazing. Always gotta order extra meatballs. They are so big! Whether it's a red cause or white sauce, you can't go wrong, yum!!!

This was one of the first places I've bookmarked since moving to SF. I can't believe it's taken me nearly 3 years later to come in and try it out! The place is really small with limited amount of seats. As popular as the place it, I'd say to just come in either when they open or be prepared to wait and aggressive enough to snatch the next table when it becomes available. The menu is displayed by the counter. You go up, order, get a number and they bring the food to you. Fortunately for me, I had a few drinks before coming so I ordered a bunch of food to try for the first time: -Burrata salad with arugula, cherry tomatoes and olive oil for $12. WOW, the burrata was sooooo creamy and everything went well together. I couldn't stop with this salad! Highly recommend this!-Gnocchi pasta for $10, added in the butter and sage sauce for an extra $1.50. They sprinkled a ton of parmesan cheese on top and overall a good dish. The gnocchi was light and went well with the butter sauce. -Pappardelle pasta for $9, added in bolognese (beef and pork meat sauce) for an extra $2. OH-EM-GEE! This was amazing! So fresh, the bolognese sauce was super meaty and flavorful and I LOVED LOVED LOVED the pappardelle. You NEED to try this combo for sure!!-I made the mistake (or not) to order the meatballs as well. They gave a plate with like 4-5 baseball sized meatballs, topped with the bolognese sauce. I couldn't even eat one of them. Great for leftovers though. On second though, no matter what you get as your main entree, you should really get this as well on the side. You're welcome. WOW, this place is amazing. I'm so glad I finally came in to try it out. This will be one of my recommendations to friends and family in the future. SO worth going to North Beach for! Come check them out.

Never in my life have I craved pasta. So if I saw the Italian Homemade Company I probably would have just walked right by and not given it a second thought. But one thing I do crave are..meatballs! And I'll say right off the bat that they have the BEST meatballs I've ever tasted. The Italian Homemade Company is a cute little pasta shop where you order first and then sit down. They have a wide variety of different pasta, pasta sauces, sandwiches and even salads. My boyfriend loves pasta, so he ordered the tagliatelle pasta with the bolognese sauce. The pasta itself is ~$9 and the sauce was another ~$2. I ordered the meatball platter which came with 6 (giant) meatballs and Piadina flatbread ($12). After you order you can watch them make everything for you on the stove right behind the cashier. In the back you can even see them making fresh pasta! The portions are generous, my boyfriend and I ended up sharing the pasta and the meatballs which was the perfect meal! Even though I don't know much about pasta or eat it that often, I know that this was definitely the freshest pasta I've ever had and perfectly al dente! But OMG, don't even get me started on the meatballs. 6 meatballs might not seem like a lot, but given how big these meatballs are, it's more than enough! I had to cut it up into six pieces and eat it that way. It comes with sauce and cheese on top as well as the flatbread drizzled with olive oil on the side. The Piadina flatbread was unlike anything I've ever had and my stomach is growling right now just thinking about dipping the flatbread into the meatball sauce. It was super thin and tasted dough-y - I know that sounds strange but trust me, it's good. Service was fantastic and paired with the food, 5 stars all around! Me craving pasta might be a thing now ever since I discovered the Italian Homemade Company. 10/10 recommend!!

I would call this the Chipotle of pasta, but that would be an insult because this place is way more authentic than Chipotle. But in concept, convenience, affordability, and deliciousness, there's a comparison.Italian Homemade Company features a variety of options of homemade noodles (hence the name), paired with your choice of sauces and sides. For sauce, I recommend the Bolognese with meatballs or pesto. For noodles, pappardelle and gnocchi are both awesome.You order and pay at the counter, find yourself a seat, and a few minutes later are served a plate of piping hot pasta on a (compostable) paper plate. Nothing fancy, just a plate of very solid pasta. Prices are in the $10-15 range, which is cheaper than most of the fancy North Beach places nearby (where you're basically paying extra for presentation).Great option for a fast casual pasta dinner with friends, when you aren't trying to impress and care more about quality of food than ambience.

Visited this restaurant about a week ago while we were in San Francisco. I found it on yelp luckily and best decision we made. My husband and I are in love with this little restaurant. The food is delicious I had the Fettuccine with white sauce and my husband the lasagna and both were amazing! It is very affordable I think for the quality the best you will find in San Francisco. The thing we loved most about it was the customer service incredible! Everyone was so welcoming, they bring the food to your table when its ready. You can really get a little taste of Italy here. We loved it so much that we went back the second day! Definitely worth the visit!

Some of the best italian food in town. Small quaint spot in little italy where you choose a style of fresh made pasta and a sauce. I had the daily special of gnocchi with calamari amd tomatoes and loved it. All super fresh and tasty and loads of tender squid. Service was casual style but friendly and family ran. I was gonna try the gnocchi roll specialty but it was out of stock so ill have to come back. My friend really liked his lasagna as well.

I've got to say, this place has some pretty solid food. If you're looking for something cheap and good, this might not be the place for you since minimum 11 dollars for a plate of pasta isn't exactly cheap. However, for the Bay Area, this is pretty damn good. My only gripe besides the price is that the meat raviolis seemed to be a bit underdone on the sides of the ravioli, leaving it a big tough to bite into. But besides that, would recommend coming in and getting anything on the menu. It won't disappoint!

This is such a wonderful spot get no frills pasta. Choose your sauce, choose your pasta, and eat off of a paper plate. Done. This place gets busy, so be prepared to order and find a spot. People don't necessarily linger very long after eating their plate, so it's not hard to find a spot. The pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente, and the sauce coats it perfectly. The only disappointment is that they ran out of meatballs!!!! Have to go back and just try those babies. Until next time!

The food equivalent of drinking Veuve from a plastic cup.Perfection, is perfection, no matter the vessel. Italian homemade is for the those with champagne pallets with soda budgets. This place basically gives pasta luxury to everyone.Each dish is handcrafted, made fresh with authentic Italian ingredients and served up up fast on a paper plate. Classy as f*ck. It's italian perfection without all the fanfare. No white tablecloth and fancy silverware, just perfect italian food, made fresh. And when the days batch of Lasagna is gone - it's gone. (And yes, it happens often).So if you are truly craving some good food without the fuss, raise that plastic fork and get some!

Italian Homemade Company popped up as the first restaurant when searching for Italian food in Russian Hill. It seemed to have good reviews and had an online ordering app on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. The menu is your standard Italian fare with salads, sandwiches, pasta, lasagna etc. I generally avoid getting pasta to-go as it gets soggy and lumpy by the time you get home, so after going through the menu I decided to get the Meatballs with Piadina Flatbread ($11). I honestly did not know what "Piadina" was, but went with it keeping an open mind.I reached the restaurant (It's on Columbus just ahead of Washington Square) 20 minutes after ordering to find that my food was ready so I was on my way. I got a heavy container with the meatballs along with the flatbread that was neatly wrapped in a silver foil. There were 6 huge meatballs. I mean these were gigantic. Unfortunately they were frozen solid. The plastic fork broke into pieces without even making a dent in these. The meatballs had to have been taken out of a freezer and used without thawing them out first. I am not sure what these folks were thinking when they gave me frozen meatballs. Would I not notice? Would they thaw out on the way home? Well, No & No. I let them stand for an hour hoping that they would thaw out. What these needed was about 3-4 minutes in a microwave, as I did not have one, I could not do much except to safely confine them in the trash. The flatbread was thin with a light dusting of raw flour. It was not built to soak up the sauce that came with the meatballs but could be used like a spoon to scoop up the sauce to quench my hunger. Price wise this dish was cheap for the location. Most of the pastas on the menu are around the $15 mark which is also a little less when compared to other Italian places in the area. There are a ton of Italian restaurants to try in the area so I have no intention of returning here after this experience.

THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS PASTA I HAVE EVER HAD! My husband and I were in SF for a few days and found ourselves exploring around the Italian district. We had coffee at a shop down the street an decided to look up reviews on restaurants nearby. I found this restaurant here, on Yelp and read unanimously positive reviews. They were right! I had the special of the day, ricotta and spinach stuffed gnocchi (roll?) topped with bolognese sauce and I added a side of meat balls with it as well. My husband got a warm Italian style sandwich that was stuffed with sausage, spinach, and cheese. Both meals were sooo tasty! I could really only describe it as Italian comfort food, it just feeds the soul. The atmosphere sort of feels like an Italian deli. You order at the counter and pay before you seat yourself. The staff was very friendly, but didn't speak the best English. We didn't mind though, because they were eager to try to answer any questions we had and it is part of the authentic feel the restaurant has. No complaints here, I would definitely revisit and highly recommend this little gem!

Purchased two orders of the vegetarian ravioli with marinara sauce as a delivery. I am highly disappointed and unfortunately will never order from this restaurant again. For what I paid (just a bit over $35 for the two portions), the portions are tiny, and had hardly any sauce. The sauce did not taste good and was very watery. The ravioli was mediocre and had hardly any filling, which also didn't taste good (like cheap pizza place parmesan cheese). It also didn't make sense to me that you pay one price for the entree but then have to pay an additional few dollars for any sort of sauce, even basic marinara. Very disappointed.

Check out talian Homemade Company for a satisfying, FILLING meal. I visited on Saturday evening with a group of four and there was a line out the door. It was packed inside and luckily a spot cleared by the time we ordered so we could sit down. We ordered the burrata salad for the table and everyone enjoyed it. I got the lasagna which was huge and delicious. Everyone else in my party was satisfied by their meals as well. They did seem to be out of quite a few things at only 6:30. We wanted to get a gnocchi roll for the table but unfortunately once we got to the cash register to order they told us they were out of it. I heard the person in front of me in line try to order gnocchi and their pesto sauce, but they were out of that too. Kind of disappointing for those people who waited in line for 20 minutes only to have to frantically change their order at the cash register. We wanted to order wine for the table, but they don't serve alcohol. The things they did have were wonderful, so I'll be back when I'm craving Italian.

OFFICIALLY THE BEST PASTA I HAVE EVER HAD.No fancy Italian spot could possibly beat this place. The ambiance is casual & chill but the food speaks for itself. So far I've tried the meat ravioli w/ marinara, pesto gnocchi, and the gnocchi roll w/ marinara and they were all equally amazing in their own way. I love the freshness of the pasta & the fact that it's cooked perfectly al dente. The texture could not be more amazeballs. The sauces are all perfectly seasoned and not too heavy, which is great b/c Italian food usually gives me major food coma. Not to mention, the portions are pretty generous and for about $10, you get an amazing plate of comfort food. I have found my new favorite Italian restaurant and I cannot wait to come back. The only downside is the parking situation since it is North Beach, but when there's a will, theres a way.

Ehhhh. I expected a lot more from fresh pasta and the reviews. I've gone to the pasta factory which is owned by the same people and it was slightly better. I got the burrata salad and fettuccine with bolognese sauce. You choose your pasta and you choose your pasta sauce. The have pretty simple sauces (marinara, bolognese, white). The portions are good, but the pasta isn't great. The pasta was all stuck together, making a bunch of it not saucy since it wasn't mixed with the bolognese sauce. The temperature was almost kind of cold on the sides and sauce but a lot hotter where the fettuccine was clumped together. It's very mediocre for the price. The place is also small and crowded. It's not somewhere I will go back to or crave. I think I can make pasta like that at home by mixing ragu and ground beef and make it taste better by not using their fresh pasta.

At first, I couldn't justify forking over nearly $20 for pasta that came on a paper plate but...The gnocchi is really good! Not chewy or hard, but gives a nice pillowy bite. Ordered a duck gnocchi plate for lunch and yes, it was hearty but so delicious. If you were to eat pasta on a cloud, this may be it. The texture is perfect, fresh and heavenly. For the amount you pay per plate, there wasn't a ton of duck in the dish. But ugh, the gnocchi was so fresh. So yes, this makes it to my "things I will crave" list. I will be back for that delicious gnocchi.

I don't even know where to begin with this review. I read up on this place prior to vacationing in San Francisco and it was one of the "must visit" locations on my list.The place is small-and nestled in the "Little Italy" section of San Francisco. So many small mom and pop restaurants surrounded the area and the aroma of amazing food was everywhere-but I had my Target.When we arrived it was packed. In time we would learn it was with good reason. We ordered our meal, grabbed our beverages and found an open table-and were met with someone there to clean it for us.The meal arrived not much longer than us sitting down and it was beyond what I anticipated.I ordered the gnocchi roll stuffed with spinach and ricotta with a layer of their bolognese on top. The taste is indescribable. I would eat it again in a heartbeat. The gnocchi was perfect cooked and the spinach and ricotta were layered throughout. The bolognese was very flavorful and the Parmesan was obviously quality.If I lived here-this would be a weekly visit.

The seating is a little uncomfortable but it does the job. For vegetarians and meat lovers this is the place to try if your a first timer in San Francisco. The line is long but its so worth it. The whole flatbreads were amazing to eat with the pasta. Wish they had beers but it's amazing it's all fresh and they have a pasta lab.There Mariana sauce was so good. I give it a 5 star not a lot of salt in the food it's just perfect.

It was quite busy on a Sunday. You wait in line to order and there is limited space. While waiting in line, I caught on how efficient this place was - very impressive. One gal on cashier, one was a runner, and another packed to go food for those who took takeout or delivery services. You can look into the kitchen and see fresh pasta being made and each dish made to order (minus lasagna of course) and the sauce. All dishes came out super piping hot though!You can choose the type of pasta noodle you want and the sauce. There are also paninis and sandwiches. I chose tagliatelle and meatballs- pretty darn good!I will have to come back and try the pesto next.

By far the worst pasta possible. Heard all the best reviews of this place; fresh pasta, made to order, good stuff really. Prices were reasonable for a tourist trap, place had a good vibe, cozy family feel to it.Friend got the lasagna with marinara sauce. I got the tagitelle with meatballs and Bolognese.Lasagna was tough and bland. "The marinara sauce was the best thing on the plate"Tagitelle was tough, parts were stuck together and cold in those pieces. Meatballs were like little sponges. Obviously frozen and badly put together. Overall bland.Stopped friend from finishing his lasagna because I cannot abide shit food touted as 'fresh and homemade'. Threw the lot away and got us to a cafe up around the corner for a quick pick me up.Friend felt queasy soon after and had some strong ginger tea to calm his stomach down.This place had a great reputation and was recomended by a few friends of mine, but what they experienced was obviously not what I or my friend did.Don't go to this place. Definitely not real italian values here.

I spent a few days in SF and ate my way though a good portion of China town and little Italy. This was the single meal that really disappointed me. I asked for a recommendation from the guy at the register and he said the flatbread sandwich. The thing was so dry it was using all the saliva in my mouth just to chew it. I asked for marinara on the side and thank God he brought it to hydrate my meal. My wife's pesto pasta was okay but not great.Your seating choices are:-wait 20 minutes for the family at the sit down table-sit in uncomfortable high chairs at a table that's about one square foot-bake outside in the hot sun after competing for one tableI was so jazzed about this place because of the high reviews and maybe I just missed "the dish". I've been asking the person at the front for recommendations everywhere I go and I've NEVER been misled or had a bad meal until now. I was not impressed, and I wish I would have ordered and been recommended something a bit more worthwhile. Sad.

For the overall environment and pasta, this place is worth checking out! The taste of the actual pasta (for both my friend and I) wasn't too flavorful but certainly not bland. So if you're looking for really flavorful pasta, maybe this isn't the place for your taste buds but it's definitely worth giving a try nonetheless!Do be wary this isn't a big restaurant and customers will be coming and going and possibly bumping into you, especially if you sit at the tables near the cash register.

Italian Homemade has the best pasta in the City - at any price! I'm a big fan of all of their pasta dishes, especially the meat lasagne, which is super stacked with at least 8 (count them!) layers, and their meat tortellini with pesto sauce. Their meatballs are excellent too - very tender, juicy, and meaty.I've also tried their gnocchi roll and Piadina sandwiches - they're fine, but they don't really compare to their pasta, which is not only handmade but also hand cut! Although their sauces are excellent, I often buy their fresh pasta to cook at home with my own sauce. Although it is pricey at about $12/lb, it's totally worth it, and is noticeably superior to any other fresh store bought pasta.

One of the most authentic and tasty Italian restaurants I have ever been in the US. Since my family is Italian and I visit the country often, I can say that this restaurant's food, environment, and staff made me feel in Italy (mostly the male Italian owner who was absolute cordial).I didn't even get the chance to take pictures of the food since we devoured it, but trust me, it was all great. My friends and I tried and LOVED the lasagna, the tagliatelle al pesto, the vegetarian ravioli with marinara, gnocchi with white sauce, and the tarta di nutella.However, some other friends got the sausage, bacon, potato, mozzarella Cassoni and the tiramisu and didn't love it as much.

We came by on a Sunday late afternoon, but there was still a pretty long line of customers waiting to order -- because the food is pretty darn good. Italian homemade is what it sounds like: good homemade Italian food, like out of a traditional Italian family kitchen. We had a dog with us, so we sat outside at one of their outdoor tables (the are about 4 two-tops). If you're sitting outside, make sure to bring a jacket and expect your food to get cold, since there aren't any heat lamps.We got the pesto gnocchi, meat lasagna, panna cotta, and a donut (tip: make sure you get the donut as soon as you pay, or else they may sell the flavor you wanted -- that happened to us!). Everything we ordered was very flavorful, well-executed, and in a large portion. I would personally skip the donut, but my eating partners wanted to try it. Overall, solid home style Italian food at reasonable prices -- I hope to return again soon!

This restaurant is located in North Beach, which is this cute little Italian area within the city. We sat there, while it rained, by the window eating. It was very relaxing. The service was great, the employees were all nice and one guy was funny. I wish I got his name! I had the fettuccine with butter and rosemary. It was SO good, hit the spot perfectly. I don't remember which pasta my boyfriend had, but he was in heaven. I also had the Tiramisu, who'd is to die for! I would definitely go back for more!

Ordered the vegetarian lasagna with sauce so the total was about $11 - it was ok but I still thought it was dry considering that the veg lasagna unlike the regular doesn't have any sauce within the layers to start with. Nothing special- but at least its large enough for two. If I was to order anything else, I would try the pesto pappardelle. Place is cute but round tables inside are flimsy and seats are stools so not the most comfortable.Overall I would try again if I'm in the city; however customer service isn't the greatest either...

I ordered dinner here via Amazon Restaurants and did not have a great experience. First, the order came over half an hour late. My scheduled delivery was by 8:47PM. Around that time, the deliver person called to say he's running 15 minutes late. It turns out he was more than 30 minutes late. Moreover, he had the audacity to mark my food as "Delivered" prior to even calling me about being late! I ordered the pappardelle with meat and bechamel sauce. As you can see from my picture, my pasta had nearly no visible sauce (and was stuck together and hardened because the delivery took so long). There was some sauce, but it was all stuck towards the bottom. The taste was pretty good, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that had the delivery not been messed up, or had I eaten in the restaurant, the food might've been pretty decent. I do like the price. The pappardelle + meat sauce was maybe $12, which is very affordable! Similar caliber restaurants in SF charge almost double that price for this dish. As such, I would be willing to give this place another try.

I ordered a typical dish (pappardelle with bolognese and meatballs) but I don't understand the good reviews. I've been making pasta since high school, and I'm very familiar with the texture of al dente. To my surprise, the pasta was a strange hard doughy texture I had never tasted before, without the chew/bite of pappardelle I've had elsewhere. The sauce was very bland as well, I kept having to add salt. The tomato sauce tasted, well, very tomatoe-y...low on herb flavor (with large chunks of herbs that I had to spit out). Lastly, the paper plates soaked up a lot of the sauce and gave it a cardboard-y flavor. This place may be a staple of North Beach, but I just can't fathom what other people are tasting to warrant the almost-5 star rating.Service was wonderful, it's a very happening location, but honestly, I could not go back for the food. Just to give you a sense of my taste for pappardelle - some of my favorites are Delarosa, Bestia in DTLA, and Mama Di's Italian Kitchen in Manhattan Beach.

AS of right now they get a 1 star...I'd LIKE to be able to try their food but... they cancelled an order I've placed Friday at ~4:30pm for Monday at 12pm. The best part is, they cancelled it less than an hour before my lunch meeting where 20 hungry people are waiting for this food from THIS restaurant.1. If you have to cancel the order, cancel it in advance, not less than an hour before.2. If you are going to cancel the order, have a better excuse than "we're out of lasagna" on a Monday morning at 12pm when you've just opened for business an hour before. Especially when I've placed the order on Friday, you've had more than 2 days notice to make the lasagna.3. At least offer other options than to just "cancel" my order altogether, without even asking for my opinion. We don't HAVE TO HAVE your lasagna if you're out of it.4. WHAT ARE YOU SELLING if YOU'RE OUT OF FOOD ON A MONDAY MORNING?!?!????I'm just in so much disbelief right now. Maybe one day I'll actually get the chance to taste your food, but for now, this is just so unbelievable.

Was craving fresh pasta so picked up their Papparadelle pasta with pesto and it hit the spot! There was a huge line and tables were packed. Glad I ordered for pick up because I got to skip to the front of the line. The wait staff were sweet despite how busy it was. Will come back for sure!

Definitely a great place to check out & great food w/ nice staff & good atmosphere. I had the prosciutto sandwich which was great & the cheese that they used for it was great. Was in Italy last year & it reminded me of it. Great place.

My husband and I had the best pasta ever during our trip in San Francisco. All we were craving one night was pasta and came across this cute little restaurant. We enjoyed two different pastas and they were SO DELICIOUS. I don't remember the pasta names but everything on their menu sounds perfect. I would give this place 10 stars if I could.

This order-at-the-counter Italian place in North Beach is, (in my opinion) one of the most authentic Italian places in the city. The meat sauce is OUTSTANDING. Thick, meaty, and perfectly seasoned, I could have eaten an entire meal of just sauce. The pasta is made Italian-style and a bit chewier than what we would maybe expect in the US.--But that's the way I like it! The restaurant is small and parking is sparse, but it's well worth the trek. I would highly recommend if in the North Beach (Or Marina!) areas and craving for some Italian food the way your grandma would make it.

Incredible lunch place with HOMEMADE everything. Pastry dough on the cassone delicious baked sandwich was almost pasta-like and their sauces!!! Hard to describe, so simple, like eating real tomatoes but with perfect additions of herb, garlic & olive oil. Famous for their lasagna, we took a piece home to have w/ dinner!

Updated review
I was in the area and was looking to grab a quick dinner with friends, so I decided to give Italian Homemade Company another shot. The first time I came, it was just so so, but I figured it was because I ordered the wrong things. I was originally eyeing the vegetarian cassoni, but unfortunately they were out =( so I decided on the gnocchi with pesto. My friend ordered the cassoni with sausage, bacon, potatoes and mozzarella. Our orders came out quick and this was much better than before! GET THE GNOCCHI AND NOT THE GNOCCHI ROLL!! These are pillows of heaven, so soft! And the pesto is yum. I tried a bite of my friend's dish and it delicious as well! I wish it came with some sort of sauce; it's on the drier side, so we were dipping it in my pesto sauce. But flavor wise it was on point! Great place for an affordable, quick dinner in North Beach.

Pasta, pasta!Have been meaning to eat in this little place in my neighborhood for a while and finally got to do it this weekend. The two dishes we tried, Gnocchi with Pesto Sauce and Lasagne with Bolognese Sauce, were both tasty and good. If I had to pick on something, it would be that I like the pasta a bit al dente and these were soft. With that said, I loved the sauces, especially the bolognese sauce. The place is tiny, but they sure serve many people. As we were having our meal, people were just streaming in and out of there. Good food!

Delicious, fresh, house made pasta. Great price and just a short walk from the tourist traps on Fisherman's Wharf. Authentic food from an Italian family run joint. Don't let the hole in the wall vibe keep you from trying this gem.

Food is just OK...I do not like it the paper plate and there is no room to sit at all. To go if u can. The most important and the reason I give the lowest star is because I order a tiramisu but they did not bring it?!! It's around $5+ and I paid for nothing! I would definitely like a refund!

OMG this place is incredible!! I ordered the gnocchi with Gorgonzola and arugula, which was a special. I came in planning to get the pesto but the special looked tempting. I wasn't that hungry but I ended up eating the whole thing because it was that good. I went to Italy last year and this was as good as the best pasta I had on my entire trip. My friend got the tiramisu which was so good especially if your favorite part of the tiramisu is the cream. The restaurant itself is extremely casual and had a counter where you walk up and order. Like the food comes on paper plates casual. There are several types of pasta and several types of sauce to chose from that you can combine. You can buy pasta by the pound to bring home if that's what you're about. There are about 6 2 person tables inside and a long table along the window with about 8 stools. When I got there, every spot was taken but the turnaround is pretty quick here. The food comes on paper plates. The people who worked there were nice and were speaking Italian, which I appreciated. It wasn't cheap (my pasta was $14) but I have no complaints because it was seriously amazing! Ugh I wish I didn't live on the East coast so I could come here all of the time!!

This place is a gem. No frills menu. They made their own fresh pasta. First bite was so comforting. Friendly staff. The place is small with some outdoor tables. Dog friendly If you're looking for a genuine "touch of Italy" . . thus is the real deal.Caio

As a tourist in SF, I would never have found this place had it not been for Yelp - so, thank you, fellow Yelpers. I made my way over on my last day in San Francisco (for coffee lovers, look across the street for some really incredible beans - no brews, mind you - just beans), and left with a heaping helping of their lasagna - two meatballs added. It was outstanding - so great that I fashioned my own little icebox and brought the leftovers back to Denver with me. It traveled well, and was just as good reheated as it has been on the first day. Tip for travelers - ask for some plastic ware if you're staying in a hotel... I forgot to do so, and was too lazy to go back down to the lobby. Ended up eating mine with leftover chopsticks, which wasn't the best way to dig in. :)

Truly like visiting Italy in a small SF Alley. Loved the creamy pesto, pillowy soft gnocci and flavorful vegeterian ravioli. Tiramisu is an added bonus. Italy on a plate!

Affordable, and delicious. Homemade pastas with the perfect al dente texture, for a fraction of the cost of the fancy Italian restaurants around SF. The meatball cassoni, an almost pita-like bread filled with cheese and meatballs with a delicious sauce on the side, really hit the spot as well. I think this is comparable to some of the best pastas we had in Italy.It's fast casual so you order at the counter, but the staff at the register were extremely nice and helpful during our order.SF needs more affordable-but-delicious food options like this place!

Ordered the papardelle, combo bechemel. Pasta texture was good. Sauce... not like my grandma's (is restaurant Italian ever as good as a real nonna's? ha! Rarely if ever, IMHO.) So, it was passable for 'restaurant Italian,' if you're having a craving. Don't expect over the moon, as I was, thanks to all the other 5-star reviews. Scratching my head about the over-the-top raves. Environment: plastic chairs, paper plates, bustling deli-type atmosphere. Not one in which you are encouraged to linger. I think they aim for you to take-out.I'm always hoping to find that eyes-roll-back-in-your-head red sauce/Sunday gravy/marinara/ as-good-as-I-grew-up-with. It's an endless search, with no luck yet. Wondering if I should start a biz, bottling my Nonna's recipe...

Came by today around 12:30 and though the tables were full there was no line waiting to order inside.Pro Tip: take your food to Washington Square just a block awayI got the veggie lasagne + 2 meatballs to go. They were kind enough to pack it in a tupperware I brought with me. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try it since I got it for my sister. The two meatballs for $1.70 weren't much larger than normal meatballs so I'm not sure I would get those again. Of course if sis raves about them I might change my mind.For myself I got the sausage, bacon, potato cheesy cassone. It's a pretty full sandwich so I was able to split with hubby in nearby Washington Square. It was a little salty due to the sausage and bacon but also really good and filling. Ooey gooey with a nutmeggy bechamel sauce which we poured inside as we ate. Very different than any other sandwich in town and very good.We also got a side order of piadina which was my favorite part of the whole meal. It was like a Chinese green onion pancake except without the green onions. Fried up, flakey and chewy I was quite happy to eat them plain when they were hot off the skillet.

This place is exactly what it should be...Superb!Yelp is pretty reliable when it comes to dining suggestions. Based on the numerous positive comments we chose to eat at "Italian Homemade Company" for "linner". The wife ordered Tagliatelle with meat sauce and you could taste how fresh the pasta was. Really nice...but, if you want to taste something that is life changingly good, GET THE LASAGNA!!! It also had the fresh pasta layered within and once you took a bite, you were rewarded. Fresh ingredients made what is typically a heavy dish and made it not so heavy. The loveliness continues with a bit of mozzarella at the end of your bite to chew and savor. So good. The portion was pretty big...I'd say about 2/3rds the size of a common everyday brick. It's more than enough for you plus enough for someone to taste and regret ordering whatever they got (idiots). The place is situated in an area that had surprisingly ample parking, but I coulda just been lucky. Inside, you grab a menu and pretend to look things over, step up and order your food (lasagna) and find a place to sit. There is clearly one "best spot" to sit and then a bunch of wobbly high tops with stools with comparable wobble build in. If you're lucky enough to get "the spot", enjoy the photo of the Trojan sitting on a scooter...awesomeness! Food comes out quick, you clean up after yourself and go home happy. Super simple and super yummy. I WILL RETURN!

I woke up on a Sunday morning craving pasta like crazy, after dreaming with Rome and pasta and gelato, so I had to get some. We were initially going to a different restaurant in the North Beach area. With no reservations, that other really famous but tourist-attracting place was full and we were hungry, so decided to find an alternative instead. Nailed it.This shop has a few tables inside and outside in the street, but we decided to buy something to go and eat picnic style at the less than 5 minute walk away Washington Park. Don't expect anything fancy, just some of the best pasta in town (heard the caprese salad is good too, but I had dreamt with pasta and salad wasn't an option for me that day).I ordered the vegetarian ravioli (only because they were filled with ricotta, and I can never say no to ricotta) and spinach, and added cheese sauce and what some would consider too much parmesan. We also got meat ravioli with bolognese sauce, they were also great, but honestly not as good as the ricotta ones.The pasta was perfectly cooked, you can tell these are homemade and fresh, or at least fresher than what you would find in most other places.Quantities were good too. Almost went back to get the lasagna to take away after we saw someone else order it. But I will be back.

Molto Bene! Lasagna grande... what a fantastic find, to be clear this is a hole in the wall with maybe 5 tables in the whole place. Food- would give it 6 stars easy, better than any Italian restaurant at home. Wife had the Lasagna and it was fantastic and enough for two, my daughter had some outstanding meat ravioli and she literally linked the plate, I had the gnocchi with two meatballs...BAM! We are going back tonight, that's right a whole city to explore and we are saying to heck with it... back to Italian Homemade!You will not be disappointed

Alright people, this place is without a shadow of a doubt INCREDIBLE. 1) The people behind the counter speak italian2) Everything is SO fresh3) The mozzarella on my salad actually blew my mind. It was so incredibly soft like a pillow of joy4) The gnocchi roll I ordered BLEW MY MIND TWICE. I haven't had gnocchi that soft, that puffy, that fresh in YEARS (since I was in Italy, and even then was it this good?)If you are questioning coming in...do notttt because it is SO SO worth it.

Ordered gnocchi with pastiaciatta, fettuccine with asparagus and cured fish egg (special), and pappardelle with meatballs. Gnocchi was really mushy. The pappardelle had a few strands that were stuck together. But worst of all, the fettuccine had FOUR, balled up, clumps of noodles the size of golf balls. Wtf man. If I wanted shitty clumped noodles I would have just stayed home and cooked pasta by myself. The special (fettuccine with asparagus and cured fish egg) was pretty meh and super fishy. It came with a butter/olive oil based sauce (no cream I think). I like fishy stuff, probably more than the average person, but it was on a whole other level. I didn't even finish half before I gave up and ordered the pappardelle and meatballs. I'm not sure why I dislike this place so much, because I absolutely LOVE their location on union st. The bolognese sauce tastes much more flavorful and the same goes for the meatballs. The meatballs at this location taste a little drier and bland. Probably won't come back to this location, but will come back frequently to the one on union.

Oh my goodness, the pasta here is so good! I need to keep coming back to try all of the combinations! The menu is pretty simple - you choose the cut of pasta you want and the sauce to go with it. There are prices for both the pasta and the sauce, which is a little weird, but I guess it makes sense. There are also a couple of other specialties, such as meatballs, lasagna... and the gnocchi roll! I had to get this because I was so intrigued. It's essentially three thick slices of gnocchi dough stuffed with spinach and ricotta, and then smothered in marinara sauce. It was fantastic! My friends got more traditional pastas, and they looked very good as well. It was so fun to watch the cooks make the orders while waiting in line, and the fact that they were all talking to each other in Italian made me know this place was legit before I even took a bite of their food.I'd love someone who is better at math to tell me how many pasta/sauce combinations there are on the menu...
