I visited City View with my parents who were in town and seeking an "authentic" dim sum experience in Chinatown, and it definitely provides that: white tablecloths, cart service, and most of the basic staples you'd expect to be served. Service is pretty good -- one thing I noticed was that a huge variety of stuff went around on the carts in the hour or so we were there. If you don't see a dish you're hoping for, just hold out and it'll come eventually!The food is average compared to some of the "better" dim sum available in SF but it's definitely a cool tourist type experience, or a great option if you're looking to avoid dropping a ton of money or waiting on a long line. There was no wait to be seated around noon on a Saturday, which is a blessing in SF, and prices were excellent -- $25/pp (after tax and tip!) for a feast-worthy amount of food.

We came here on a weekday afternoon at about 1.30pm and it was not too crowded. The place does not serve congee (my staple for dim sum), but what we had was decent:Har gao (ok), siew mai (ok), xiao long bao (ok), chicken feet (preferred Good Luck Dim Sum's), liu sha bao (yummy), shrimp chee cheong fun (this version has vege in it), glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaf (this version has clear segregation of rice and meat). Egg tarts were sold out so it could have been pretty good? Price was reasonable for a dim sum restaurant (cheaper than Yank Sing). Service was a little rushed, with the servers telling us to meet the 2pm last order deadline (but they seated a couple who walked in at 2pm. D'oh!)

Very good cart service for tourists . Everyone speaks English here and the dim sum is decent enough .. they use pickled radish and vegetables in their dumplings if you're not used to that. Unfortunately they were missing my favorite rice shrimp rolls so knocked one star off for that . I also found it was a bit expensive @ over 30/person .

I came with a party of 6 and waited 30 minutes for a table around noon on Sunday. City View had offerings that I wasn't use to at other dim sum restaurants like their shrimp honey walnut, but they also had the usuals. My friends and I paid ~$30 per person at the end. I wouldn't plan on coming back here as the different dishes were hit or miss. It was convenient as the different carts would come around, and you could easily add food if you were still hungry. I brought some of my friends, and it was their first time to a dim sum restaurant. City View was nice as you could see what you may be interested in eating if you're unsure as to the names of the different dishes. However, walking out of the restaurant, I realized there were some carts that didn't make it by the table as there were some dishes that weren't offered to us. I'd be interested in looking for better dim sum around the city.

For some of the best dim sum in San Francisco you should definitely try this place it's a little crowded and chaotic but the dim sum is totally good also thought I was a bit overpriced. They really bombard you with tons of selections of my girl really liked it so we wanted to try it I enjoy the atmosphere but it was like I said very chaotic.The good thing about dim sum is once your full about an hour later you can eat some more so we brought some home for later which was still very tasty

Thank goodness for reservations! Came in a little after 12pm with my coworkers and this place was packed! Not sure if the downstairs is typically used during this time, but the place was fairly busy. The restaurant is more spacious than other dim sum spots, with a little more space in the aisles to walk by. The space looked clean and the inside was nice and bright. The place is located in Fidi/almost CT, so there are other dim sum options not too far from this place. We were seated immediately and the food carts came around quickly and pretty frequently, so we were always given more options before finishing what we had and waiting for more. That's the great thing about going with a larger group of people to dim sum is that you can taste a greater variety of dishes. I will say that the vegetarian dishes were really tasty! But my favorite was probably the xiao long bao. They had some dishes that are not typically offered at dim sum, like some chicken dishes. They even had green tea mousse as an option for dessert, different than the typical sweet buns you would order. The main dishes were pretty standard, but the food was still pretty tasty. The calamari had a better type of breading than I'm used to-more of a soy sauce taste which was a nice change. And you can't go wrong with sesame balls. I do wish they had a little more of the red bean paste, but I still enjoyed them.Good dim sum spot for lunches with coworkers if you don't want to make the trip to another spot in CT.

Great place for a dim sum lunch, especially around financial district. Not a lot of options if you have dietary restrictions (most things have meat/seafood), but fantastic if you eat everything. I personally stick to chicken and seafood, and had no issues trying a bunch of different items here. Make a reservation if you can, as it gets crowded during the week. Good for groups, and probably better if you come with more people as you can really try a lot of different things before you get full.

Caution - Writer of this review is in a FOOD COMA !!!Delicious, Lip smacking, mouthwatering and other great words are not enough to describe my experience of this place. OK ! Enough being dramatic, lets talk about the real thing. They have a cart system and a menu system. By cart system I mean the servers roam around on carts with food on them. If something appeals you, you can just pick that plate and start hogging. I went for the safe option, the Menu option. I picked three things from the menu walnut honey shrimp, chicken buns and chicken skewers. FOOD-Walnut honey shrimp - Full size shrimps coated with a layer of creamy honey sauce with crispy walnuts accompanying it. Shrimps cooked perfectly, had a nice flavor to them. No one can stop on one :P Chicken Buns - Pan seared buns filled with spicy minced chicken filling. I am literally drooling even thinking about them. So soft, served hot and filling was just amazing. Great flavor !!!!!Chicken skewers - Crispy yet tender chicken thigh on a skewer. Paired well with the spicy red sauce, enough for 2 people as you get only 2 skewers in a plate. Ambience and Service - It was packed when I went in, had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. Service is pretty quick and the food is served hot. Also, it a huge restaurant with ample of sitting space, good for big groups and they serve green tea with food.

Hot and fresh dim sum, the runners resupply the carts with delicious dim sum. The lava bar are so good as are the soup dumplings. The shu mai is terrific as is the ha gow. The scallop gow was awesome too. DD said their baked char shu bow was the best she'd had. Good service and pretty clean. I love it!

One of the best dim sum restaurants I have ever been too, only competition is a place I know in Southern California but hands down, the best in the north. Authentic real Chinese dim sum. I don't have to describe every single dish because they were all good. The taro cake is already, a winner. Love this place. Only issue, we didn't get all the different types of dim sum to choose from so we got a limited choice to pick from. I would wish they would have everything pre prepped so customers can order them all. I asked for fried taro balls, shrimp dumplings, and other dishes but had to wait. The wait was too long.

Exactly what you would expect in an excellent dim sum cart restaurant. All your favorites, super fast service and execution was good. The only thing keeping this from a 5 is that the wrappers on everything were a little thick. But other than "heavy handed" no complaints. We ate our faces off in 20 min and only $40.

I usually give five star reviews for places that I think have good service, atmosphere, and food quality that meets standards for the price you pay. This place definitely meets those expectations. I came around 11 AM, right before the lunch rush. The restaurant is located on a quieter street and is very clean (in comparison to other Chinese restaurants I've been to). The service is pretty fast at seating you and getting you water and tea. There are a decent amount of carts servicing around and they call make sure to stop at your table.I will confess part of the reason I came here was became it seemed like the servers understood both English and Mandarin, and the most stressful parts about dimsum for me around this area is communicating what I want in mandarin - since I'm not particularly fluent. So, that was an added bonus to all this.As for the food, I personally liked everything I ate. Which was part of the reason I didn't take any pictures this time unfortunately. But the food is all pretty good quality. I tried the egg tarts, almond jelly, ribs, Peking duck (I love duck), siu mai, lotus rice and shrimp dumplings. I will echo what everyone else says about not over ordering though. I was so full after all of this. Overall, I had a good experience and as someone who has been to quite a few dimsum places around here, this is one of my favorites :)

Believe it or not, I've never REALLY had a full-blown Dim Sum experience yet, and I guess, leave it to San Francisco to hook it up. I had a blast. I always enjoy exploring this type of food but I kind of struggle with the menu and what to choose. They just roll a big ol' cart full of delicious stuff up to you and let you pick. I think I ate one of everything? So fun. Definitely order the Soup Dumplings - you have to be good at chopsticks a little, and somewhat surgical with the process. Don't tear them. I like working for it a little bit sometimes.

There's no city view with this restaurant. Considered to be a high-end dim sum restaurant, we can all decipher that to be very Americanized dim sum.Nothing was terrible, but nothing particularly stood out. Service was attentive. Despite ordering all of our favorite dim sum dishes (sans a few because they aren't offered here), we left slightly unsatisfied.I did like that we were seated right away because it's located away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chinatown, but hey, authenticity wise, City View is catering to a very different crowd.

This is my office's go-to spot for dim sum in FiDi. It's not outstanding, but it does the job very well, no complaints.I don't feel like boring people with a rundown of our orders, but the most typical items were fine. Har gow (shrimp dumpling) was round and juicy, with a thin, chewy skin. Lor mai gai (sticky rice with filling) was as it should be, with chicken, mushroom, and Chinese sausage wrapped inside. Chive dumplings had what Cantonese people call "wok hei," hard to describe in English, but basically that you can tell the oil was sizzling when food was cooked / mark of a good chef. Sesame balls looked normal. Tip: Xiao long bao isn't a normal dim sum dish, people.I always lol a little bit when I see that Yelp warns me that the restaurant I'm reading about has poor food safety...unfortunately, I'd probably argue that the more authentic a Chinese spot is, the poorer the food handling (and yes I'm from Hong Kong).

Simply incredible. The food, atmosphere, and experience are quite pleasant. Perfect for family gatherings, brunch with friends, and even chowing down a 48 platter of egg custard rice cakes with a good homie after a grueling lift at the gym. Their hours are different so check in advance. And be prepared to possibly wait a while before being seated.

Many of the dishes that were pushed around were different from what I usually see and there were some dishes that I usually see that weren't there. I did learn that I like baked sho pao better than steamed. They had these shrimp egg rolls that were pretty good. I tried a turnip cake for the first time which was very tasty. The texture was different, but with some chili and soy sauce, it was addicting. Shu mai is shu mai, I don't taste the difference between other dim sum places. They had soup dumplings which was a bonus, but they weren't as good as the ones I had in NY at the dumpling house. Sadly, they didn't have my favorite - black bean spare ribs. I ordered their duck, but it wasn't as flavorful as the ones I had in SSF. Place is surprisingly packed on a weekday by 12pm! It's the first dim sum place I've been too that had relatively more Caucasians than Asians dining. Service was fast and friendly (shocker). I liked this place but it wasn't the best dim sum I've had.

Our first time at Dimsum! This was delicious. The food was great. Went with my teenage daughter and we both loved everything we ate and wished we had a few more people with us so we could try more food! Had 2 different dumplings, pork buns, shrimp rolls, sesame chicken and Chinese donuts and spent only $40! Took off a star only because it was a little confusing and there was not much explanation for newcomers especially when it came time to pay and we had to wait over 20 minutes for anyone to total up our bill.

Location: Right near the entrance to China Town in an alley way it's easy to find. Since it's in an alleyway parking is scare if there is any so definitely walk if you're coming here. Price: Pricier than other dim sum places, but it makes sense for SF. Service: Come 15-30 minutes before the lunch rush if you're coming with a big group. I don't think they take reservations. When we've gone we still haven't had to wait long even with a group of 12. They do get a bit frazzled when there are tons of people and it does get hard to determine who's your actual waiter. My peeve with this place is that we had an order of peking duck left and while we were waiting for a waiter to bring us a box another waiter came to clean up our table quickly and threw it away. A WHOLE PEKING DUCK! :( After doing so, they acted like it wasn't really anything instead of compensating us or asking if they could do anything to make up for it. Such a waste.Food: We get a large mix of everything so it's hard to list everything we've tasted here. They have a great selection of dumplings, desserts, and other items you can order ala carte so you never have to worry that there won't be something for you.

Came At lunch with a coworker we felt very rushed. The waiter asked us four times if we were done and actually gave us our check prior to us finishing. We were only there for 45 minutes! Their goal is to turn over tables quickly because of the huge crowds. However, it greatly diminishes the service and ruins the experience. I literally wanted to scream go the hell away! I will let you know when we want our check. When he wasn't asking he was walking by nervously and anxiously pausing -it just made us very uncomfortable. We also had to wait 20 minutes before our ordered dumplings were bought out, by this time everything else was cold and pretty much done, so we didn't get to enjoy it with our crunchy items and vegetables. We wanted to enjoy our tea and relax for 10 minuets after our meal, but just didn't feel comfortable after being so rushed! PLEASE educate your staff. I give it 2 stars because I've been to a lot of dim sum places and the food is very good actually -except The greens were sitting in a huge puddle of oil. Also a man who appeared to be in charge did come out And asked if we had been helped yet prior to us being seated which was very nice. Ensure the dishes come out closer so they can be enjoyed "Hot" All together and train the staff not to rush customers. I will try it again and edit this review if the service has been corrected.

Dim sum here was delicious and was served in carts at tables, which is my favorite way of having dim sum. The craftsmanship on the dumplings is pretty remarkable if you stop to look at the patterns on the dough before popping them in your mouth.The bill can be a surprise because they use the stamp system. Approximate cost per size next to stamps: Smallest ($3.85) medium ($4.20) large ($5) special 1 ($6) special 2,3,4 (?)

Some complain that this place is too clean and too Americanized to be authentic. Since I am clean and I am American, I do not share their concern. I agree with some of the concerns from people who give this place a so-so review. This is not the dim sum experience that many people seek. But I'm OK with that. Would I call this the McDonald's of dim sum? Absolutely not. City View is one of my favorite dim sum places for exactly those reasons, but also because it's truly good. I took my family there on a weekend (the place was surprisingly busy), and my two sons (one picky, one not) really enjoyed it. About a year ago we took them to a place in the Inner Richmond which has more street cred, but none of us liked it. Does that make us bland and unadventurous? If so, I'd much rather have this whitey version of dim sum, thank you very much. The reason I like City View is that the ingredients seem fresh. I've been to dim sum places where everything tastes suspiciously similar; not the case at City View. I've also been to other places where an hour after eating I developed a tingly upper lip and a headache (I assume from too much MSG). Not the case here. In short, I've been to a lot of the other places that may be perceived as more authentic, but I still assert that City View's food is fresher and of better quality. And as another reviewer noted (very funny); service is surprisingly warm for this kind of establishment.

This is a great spot for dimsum for those working in FiDi and wanting a quick dimsum fix.I've come here a couple times with 1-2 friends each time, and we've always enjoyed the meal. Most recently I came right around noon on a Wed with a friend, and while I was afraid there would be a wait, we were able to get seated immediately. Throughout our meal I never saw a very long line up of people at the door, so I'm guessing it usually doesn't get too crowded here. This is one of the few dimsum places I've been to in the bay area (if not the only one actually...) that still pushes carts around. Because of this, you could pull off a very quick lunch here in 30 minutes or less. I really like the environment of the restaurant. It's very large and airy and clean, and the tables are spaced far apart enough where nothing feels cramped as you'll often find in Chinese restaurants.The food here isn't the most amazing dimsum I've ever had, but it is pretty darn good. My friend only eats seafood and shrimp but no pork, and City View had a great selection of dimsum items for her, even these steamed dumplings with ground chicken that I haven't seen elsewhere.Given its location between FiDi and Chinatown, it definitely is pricier at around $20 pp, but I think it's worth it for an authentic dimsum experience!

Got here on a Sunday at 12:30 and the wait time for four people was only 25 minutes. It was pretty packed so I was impressed that we got seated so quickly! The service was okay, they didn't come by with the dim sum cart until we were done with our first round of food. We waited about 15 minutes until another dim sum cart came to our table/our side in general. Chili oil was not very good or spicy. Very disappointed in that. Overall the food was good and not that expensive considering it was in Chinatown in SF.

A nice respite from the hectic chaos of Downtown San Francisco is City View Restaurant.I would never have found City View if it were not for my friends who recommended it; as it is tucked down an alley, Commercial I believe.The restaurant itself is immaculate...as in super clean. For me this is always an indication of quality. Service was simple and succinct. Food was good not great but for the price to quality ratio....I am a huge fan now.Dim sum carts galore with wonderful chicken feet ( so good), mini bao, great sauteed greens, and more. The only dish I did not care for or thought was mediocre were the pot stickers.As for the debate on the restaurants name: It is in an alley with no view but they have a very large painting of the lovely Chinese city Guilin. My two cents.Highly recommend

Lacks quality and substance. Noodle dishes (dumplings, pot stickers, etc) were all heavy and soggy, sparse filling with average to below average quality.

Considering this place is more expensive than most Dim Sum restaurants in SF, it is a complete rip-off.

Parking's an issue but when is it not in the city? We parked in a garage about a two-minute walk away.

My friends and I came around 11:30am for dim sum on a Sunday morning and we definitely skipped the line because we got seated right away (table of 6) but we saw people waiting at the door within the next 10 minutes. I'm from Hong Kong, so honestly I cannot say the dim sum here is good at all but compared to the other dim sum places I've had in the US this place isn't the worst either...let's just say I'm sure they are better dim sum places in SF, but I guess this place is okay too...The biggest problem I have with this place is how we had to wait 20 minutes for some siu mai (pork dumplings). Siu Mai and Ha Gau are two of the most popular dimsum dishes ever, so I can't understand why the restaurant took forever to bring those dishes out. You can't order dim sum individually, you have to wait for the carts to come by and hope that they have the items you want. Which wouldn't be a problem if the restaurant is good with coming out with the foods people want but it is clearly not the case for City View. We ate a solid amount and in the end it came out to around $22 per person (including tip)--reasonable. I don't think I'll come back again just because there are many better dim sum places in Chinatown.

TLDR - Decent dim sum that's more Americanized and lacks the normal variety of traditional dim sum, but takes reservations!Not really your standard dim sum place. Their selection is more limited and seems a little more catered to Americans, based on both the food and the clientele. There were some very nontraditional dim sum items on the menu/carts, like calamari, chicken skewers, egg rolls, sesame chicken and lettuce wraps. We mostly avoided those and stuck with normal dim stuff items, which were generally not bad, but the limited selection left my dim sum craving somewhat unsatisfied.Prices weren't too high: $3.85 for small dishes, $4.40 for medium, $5 for large and $6 for special. Tea was $3/person. Service is what you'd expect from any Chinese place. They don't have very many carts going around but they're surprisingly good about making their way around all the tables, even the ones in the corner.On the plus side, they take reservations even for dim sum (though it doesn't seem to get as packed as a lot of other places). And they validate 2 hrs parking at the Chinatown Portsmouth Square parking lot nearby.GET:* Shrimp Siu Mai ($6, special) - Amazing texture! Super tender and soft. Comes with 3 siu mai.* Mushroom Fun Gao ($4.40, medium) - Comes with 3 dumplings filled with wood ear mushroom and veggies. Delicious!STANDARD:* Shrimp Dumpling ($5, large) - Comes with 4 pretty large dumplings.* Turnip Cake ($3.85, small) - A little greasy had a good texture* Chicken Feet ($3.85, small) - Tender and flavorfulSKIP:* Chinese Broccoli ($6, special) - SUPER greasy* Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($5, large) - The rice noodle had a weird mushy texture and the beef tasted odd* Stuffed Bell Pepper ($5, large) - Comes with 3 green bell peppers topped with shrimp. Not really a traditional dim sum dish. Shrimp was the same as the shrimp dumpling or shrimp siu mai, but each bell pepper was sitting in a pool of oil. Kind of gross.

Never knew this place existed until I keep hearing my colleagues talk about it. I guess this is the closest and inexpensive dim sum place near the financial district. The dim sum is fresh! I like the shrimp and chives, eggplant,shrimp, and tofu, shrimp churn fun. Hoping to try different items next time. The wait could be long. Just don't try to come on a Friday. Or during 12pm. Best to arrive 11:30am or after 12:30pm (the lunch rush seemed to clear up a bit) but kinda hard to get dim sum , the carts did not come around frequent enough.

This is an excellent place for Dim-Sum. The usual items were as expected; pork buns, pot stickers, fish cakes and dumplings. My favorite was the duck which was served with a soft bun to make a miniature sandwich with. My second favorite was the sweet pork buns, which were packed with pork and featured a tasty, soft bun. For dessert, I had a green tea custard, which was superb. Rich, deep green tea flavor. Four stars for service, water was not received promptly, which is a must for sit-down restaurants.

Pros: super fast to get your food because they bring dishes around on carts and you can just pick what looks good. the food is good. This place is not too expensive especially if you're with a big group. Though I did come with only one other person for lunch another day and it ended up being $30 total and we were stuffed --and I know this place is cheaper than similar other restaurants in SF I recommend: Shanghai (soup) dumplings, peaking duck with buns, bbq pork buns (steamed and baked are good), the potstickers were ok but nothing too special, the egg custard in puff pastries (not sure what they're called)Cons: we went with a big party one day for lunch and there was another big table next to us that the carts always went past first, so they always took all the good stuff -- but you can order specific dim sum from the cart people if you have something in mind and they'll bring it to you. I don't really like how you don't know how much any of the items cost, you just point to what you want and they stamp your card, and it's a surprise at the end how much it costs.

We tried to find a dimsum place in china town. I found this restaurant from internet. We were there for 6 people and we have to wait about half an hour. It was okay. There was packed. The food was delivery cart style which i like because you can see all the food what it looks like before you order. There is no specific server. In general, they were nice. The food was decent. (Judge by asian lol)Overall, i like it. I would go back there.

Review is for lunch, on a Tuesday with the hubs! Hooray for time that we have together during a work day!Must haves:- shrimp and chives dumpling (comes in 3 pieces)- shrimp noodle (the one that comes in an oval dish with soy sauce)- barbecue pork puff pastry Comparisons:- seat-ability: easier to get a seat here than Yang Sing (Stevenson location)- budget: less expensive than Yang Sing- Shanghai dumpling comparison: Yang Sing's Shanghai dumplings are better, and it costs more at YS

City View is a stand out for dim sum in San Francisco. Right when you are seated you are tempted by delicious items one cart after another. From expertly wrapped dumplings to delicious sesame balls, you can't go wrong with anything that you order.Be sure to get there when they open to guarantee you won't have a wait as this place fills up quickly and there is always a line on Saturday/Sunday to get in.I'd also recommend going with a group so you can try more items. If you don't see something you are looking for, just ask and if they have it they'll bring it over.Definitely a great place for locals and tourists that I recommend to all my friends/family.

It's been a while since I've been here. My co-worker asked me for a dim sum recommendation and I suggested this restaurant. A group of 7 arrived at noon (with reservations). It's relatively on the pricey side in Chinatown (near Financial District). There's a wide assortment of dim sum, all of which I must say are fresh (hot), beautifully plated and of course, delicious. Most of the dim sum are delivered by moving carts which come pretty frequently. However, if you want something you don't see, flag someone down, he/she will bring it to you. The service is prompt and attentive without the usual attitude you'll find in most dim sum places.Clean and spacious dining area, a good selection of dim sum, all of which made the whole dim sum experience a pleasant one. Glad I made a good recommendation for my co-worker who ended up flipping the bill!

Richard Pro here with another review.Used to really like this place but this is the first time I've been here since five years ago. It was a pretty disappointing lunch. The restaurant was packed, and it's nice and bright inside, quite different from your usual hole in the wall dim sum places. However, the variety of food was rather lacking for a Sunday lunch. Saw a very standard ordinary selection of 15 items or so. The cheung fun was excellent, the lotus rice with chicken was alright, and the pork spareribs were subpar. The fried calamari was horrible--thick breading and no seasoning. The fried green onion pancake was plain and bland. We ordered a few other things too but nothing really stood out.

Best dim sum in S.F. !!!I've been coming to this great dim sum place for years and have continued to be impressed by the food. Everything is fresh and tastes great! Perhaps due to the high-volume, there's always new batch coming out.Seating is quick, very little waiting even at peak lunch hours. Service is exceptional. If I ask for something not on the cart, they relay the info to someone who does have what I want and it arrives promptly.

City View has decent dim-sum fare. Our party got a variety of dishes, but some of the highlights from that day were the shrimp siu mai, turnip cake, CHICKEN FEET (okay, maybe it was good to me because I have been craving these for the LONGEST time), shrimp har gao, and stuffed three treasures (tofu and eggplant). I was quite surprised they had calamari as an option, as I didn't think that was standard dim-sum food, but it was okay also. The space we were seated in (the corner) was very cramped, and felt lacking in air flow half of the time. Other than that, I had a satisfactory experience here, though I may not come back for a while since it's a bit out of the way. Always come with a group to eat dim-sum, for it's just too expensive to eat by yourself!

Solid dim sum spot right on the cusp of Chinatown and FiDi. Unlike many other Chinatown dim sum spots, City View has a nice ambiance and functions as a great option for a quick business lunch. I've been here numerous times with coworkers and the opinion is always a resounding A-ok. You get to select which items you want based on the different moving carts. Some of the highlights are the turnip cakes, sticky rice and shrimp rice rolls. Happy Eating, Yelpers!

City View is located downtown on Merchant between Kearney and Montgomery Streets, good luck finding parking..Located in an Alley, City View has no view but it is a large high-energy dining room with a wonderful landscape painting on one wall that I just love to look at..I like the energy of the lunch rush here. I can order off a menu and or choose items of interest right of the carts that circulate the dining room. .My recent chicken in a lettuce cup I couldnt even pick up as they served it on a split lettuce leaf. Often the calamari is either far too salty or cold/old and chewy..Although the filling of the Lo Mai Gai is a little sparse, I do love the flavor of this sticky rice in a Lotus Leaf. I am also a fan of their Shanghai Soup Dumpling. They always include something like a wine vinegar and shredded ginger. And, you can actually pick up their dumpling with out breaking it and loosing all the soup..So much of this style of food is subjective; you will just have to come try them out for your self.

Not bad. The SO and I came in for dim sum on a Saturday without reservations. Mistake. City View is actually one of the few, if not only places, in SF that actually takes dim sum reservations, which is pretty nice when you don't have all day or want to take guests to dim sum but want to eat at a notable hour. They definitely deserve a fourth star for that alone.We however, didn't have reservations and went into the wait queue with everyone else. The place was definitely the epitome of chaos because we were seated within a few minutes on a lucky whim that a waiter saw us standing and pointed at a random table and seated us.. while neglecting everyone else. oops.Anyways, the food here is decent! We got the typical dim sum classics -- siu mai, shrimp dumplings, rice rolls with shrimp, pai gu, and some other things. The menu here is fairly limited relative to other dim sum places (no porridge, no basic fried noodles), and it's pretty clear that the places caters to the nontraditional crowd based on a) how great everyone's English is b) how Americanized some of their newer creations were c) the fact that they have a set menu that's basically just various forms of chow mein lol. That being said though, the dim sum dishes themselves were decent. The pai gu was not very good though, but everything else was quite comparable in quality. Price is decent and fair, and the place is quite clean.tldr; most unique thing about this dim sum place is that they take reservations! and the food is decent

I'm writing this review from the perspective of a tourist in the city. I grew up eating dim sum pretty often, but my wife didn't. Because of that, I spent a lot of time online before our trip to San Francisco trying to find a good dim sum place - somewhere with good food, but that wasn't a hole in the wall. (I'd be down for trying the dirtiest, non-English speaking place if they had the best dumplings in town, but I didn't think that would go over too well with the wife.)The website for City View made it look like it would probably be good, so that's where we headed. As we walked there I began to get nervous. The street it was on was more like an alley and there weren't any signs that a nice restaurant would be anywhere near there. We got close to where it should be and, sure enough, there was a little wooden sign on the sidewalk with the name of the restaurant and an arrow pointing to it. The windows were heavily tinted and I figured this place must be a dump... but then we opened the doors and were greeted by a lovely, clean interior with plenty of linen-topped tables and carts running up and down the aisles. There were also Asians and white people eating here - a good sign that we would get good food, but also be able to order (plus I saw one of the white guys with one chopstick in each hand... clearly we wouldn't be the whitest people here today).We ordered a ton of dumplings, sticky rice, honey walnut shrimp, and other goodies. Everything was delicious and exactly what I'd been looking forward to. I don't want to say the food was perfect, but it was pretty great and we enjoyed everything. The waiters were all very nice and, while some spoke English better than others, none of them had any trouble understanding our orders. They did a good job coming by with the carts and seemed to always be there just as we were thinking about getting another plate of whatever dumplings we just finished. The prices were also pretty reasonable, especially when it's possible to rack up a pretty hefty bill eating dim sum.City View ended up being perfect for our needs. It has the delicious food and good variety that I was looking for, but was also clean and accessible for someone less adventurous (like my wife). I would definitely return here myself and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for anyone else looking for a good balance of authenticity and accessibility.

Decent but pricey dim sum in Chinatown. There is a nice cleanliness that is a stark contrast to most of the alleyways in SF, but a lack of the authentic Cantonese soul that goes into these steamed and fried brunch bites. The menu even has only English and Japanese.I tried the standard shu Mai, har how, xiao long bao, Chinese broccoli, and shrimp noodles. The waiters took a while to bring out some of the dishes and I think at the end of brunch they ran out of things I wanted like egg tarts. While they do the cart experience, the food was pretty average and not anything special.It's ok for a first timer doing Dim sum but as a veteran there's much better around the bay.

I don't typically enjoy dim-sum that much...maybe because I grew up eating a lot so I don't care too much about it. I must say this place is very decent for the quality of the food to how much it cost. This place also seems very clean. We came here for a work lunch with about 8-9 people and the bill came out to be ~$170 which I thinks is pretty good for the amount of food we got. This is just as much for a party of 4 at yangsing. You should always go with 3- 4 people to dim-sum. Each dish comes with about 3-4 so if you want to try everything come with more people.

I don't think I would have found this dim sum spot on my own. It's somewhat tucked away. But I'd recommend it to anyone because it's got pretty much all the right elements for a traditional dim sum experience (especially one where the dim sum ladies come out with dim sum carts) without having to venture too far from the heart of SF.

Toddler scratch shit dimsum for the FiDi price.Food:We ordered about 15 different things. Everything was either a salt bomb or bland as faak. The XO rice roll was pretty good at first 2/3 of a bite and I was like "ooh it's crunchy on the outside, so interesting" until I bit into the last 1/3 of under-cooked rice fucking paste.Only pity stars for the barely more existent service compared to most restaurants around Chinatown and the generally clean space.

Love this place! This is one of the more reasonably-priced dim sum places I've been to near downtown. As much as I love the places out in Sunset, it's kinda a pain to go all the way out there every time I'm craving dim sum. It gets busy here on both weekdays and weekends, but I *think* they take reservations if you let them know in advance. That being said, when I've come here in groups of 4 or less, the wait isn't usually that long. I went here this past weekend and they had the dim sum on carts, something I don't always see in city centre dim sum restaurants due to the tables taking up so much space. That's one of the reasons I keep coming back - the cart way is particularly more engaging when coming here with out of town visitors. I don't get anything fancy here food-wise - just the usual things you'd find at most dim sum places. But that's good enough for me and keeps me coming back for more :)

Ok we fell in love with this place immediately. Came here on Christmas Day at 2pm after having arrived earlier in San Francisco. It was my first true Dim Sum restaurant. I have always heard about the concept and was intrigued but there isn't good Dim Sum in GA. They started coming around with the carts and we were all overcome with delight at the feasts before us. Shumai, sesame chicken, buns, dumplings, potstickers, Chinese broccoli, crispy egg rolls. Absolutely wonderful. This place will always leave me wanting more. The sheer variety was astounding. The best part is it is off the beaten path. It is an intentional restaurant. You make the effort to come here. It is worth it.

Despite some really racist reviews on this place (caters to white people like Ton Kiang), this is my favorite dim sum place in the city. Definitely not as pricey as Yank Sing, but the same quality food. Dim Sum is my favorite Sunday morning activity. Anyone who knocks this place has an attitude problem; the number of white people in a restaurant does not downgrade its caliber. There, I said it!!

This place has decent food but bad service (as most dim sum places are)and pricey. Dim sum used to be really cheap. Why are all the chinese places turning into $$$ place?? I went here with 3 other people and we spent $150...Good luck dim sum on Clement St would feed 4 people for $30. I am not going back to this place to get decent dim sum when I have to tip for bad service.

Dim sum is good here. They have a definite route while serving food so you have to keep an eye out. They are good about filling the carts and going to every table, and the servers are nice. It opens at 11 and I would recommend going close to that time as it does get really busy. There is a line out the door the whole time but it doesn't take TOO long to get seated. A little more pricey than some other places, but in the FiDi it's expected. Just being able to walk from work is pretty cool.

My go-to dim sum place to take out-of-town guests. It's the usual Cantonese cart fare, but taken up a notch in terms of healthiness, ingredient quality, and ambiance. I stick to seafood except for the pork and crab xiao long bao (petite but juicy and intensely flavorful). As always, if you see something unusual, grab it before it goes (at my last visit, there was a vegetable dumpling that was deeply shiitake flavored, with a great kick to it). You can order special items, but it's not worth the extra expense (tried the Peking duck and found it disappointing, flaccid and greasy).
