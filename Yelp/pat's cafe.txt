So good! And, for the area, very well-priced. It's a teeny-tiny little spot that's a few blocks from the wharf, but it's worth checking out, especially if you're tired of the touristy stuff and the prices that come with it.The banana-granola pancakes were probably the best pancakes I've ever had. Eggs were flavorful and the bacon was cut thick, so much to like at this little spot. The service was prompt and friendly, a great way to start your day.Hollywood Cafe also has great ratings, but that came with almost an hour wait. Skip that crap and come here, where we were seated in about five minutes. It's worth it. My only complaint is that the space is very small, so prepare to be close to people and a little tight -- we got to (unfortunately) hear the entire conversation of the couple next to us, where a guy was talking about how he read, on his cell phone, about how cell phones are making people dumber.Breakfast = great. Service = awesome. Show = ehhhhhhhh, haha.

Cute little cafe in downtown SF. It's a tiny restaurant and they maximize space by putting tables and chairs very close to one another. There was a short wait when I arrived but my party was seated within 10 min. It was a bit awkward because the place is small so we were either standing in the way of servers or on top of another table while they were eating. The staff was friendly and the food was alright. I had the chicken sausage crepe. I liked it but I wasn't super impressed. It had a very healthy serving of sausage but not very much of the other fixings so I felt like I was just eating bread and meat. Overall if I'm in the area and needing a place for breakfast I'd likely stop by again and try out a different item on the menu.

Totally pleased with this place for breakfast. We've waited in line before but it was just taking too long to get in. While we are fans of Mama's on Washington, this was a great place to stop since the wait was not very long. The menu has so many delicious and hearty offerings. The service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend the French toast with fruit. The coffee was robust and not the least bit bitter.

Lovely little breakfast find in North Beach just off Columbus in San Francisco. So glad Yelp directed us to this spot and we avoided the hour-long-wait-outside-of-a-pretentious-breakfast-place gig. Yay Pat's and yay Yelp.Pat's is a down home little restaurant north of a diner and slightly south of a fancy breakfast spot with favorites from omelettes and eggs, pancakes, waffles and lots of things in between. Ultimately went with an old California favorite, Joe's special which didn't disappoint.Sampled the California omelette from across the table which was cheesy and delicious.Agree with some of the previous commenters that even though they are corralled by a red-vest-wearing Pat, the staff seems a bit lackluster and because I wanted decaf wound up eating my breakfast without a 2nd cup of coffee.Definitely give this place a try.

Meh. Came here for brunch and it barely hit the "ok" mark. The tables along the wall are so close to each other that even a small person (I'm barely over 120lbs) couldn't scoot between the tables if you needed to get up. Props to our friendly table neighbors who moved their table back to help me out. My husband and I both ordered benedicts. His was completely wrong and had to go back. Mine was fine except they forgot the hollandaise sauce. Luckily poaching eggs moves fast as my husband's meal was back out in a few minutes. As for our friendly neighbors, the gal's meal was also all wrong, and when it came back out, the avocado in her omelette was brown. The food was good but the experience could've been substantially better.

This is a really nice place located near the wharf in San Francisco. While walking around the area, I came across this gem on a local street. The restaurant is small and almost has a country look/feel to it. The service is friendly and the vibe is very laid back. I grabbed a seat by the window, which turned out to be awesome as it offers a little privacy and allows you to see the whole restaurant. I had the French toast which was good, sausage which was also good, and some home fries which were good but almost cold. Not sure if they had the home fries sitting out or what, but that was a bit disappointing.Home fries temperature aside, the food here was very good and the country/cafe vibe about the place is definitely fitting for having a Saturday morning breakfast. It definitely gets crowded after 11am, so keep that in mind when coming here. All in all though, a cool spot.

A friend of mine recommended Pats to our group of four for breakfast before we explored the city. It was pretty empty at 10am on a Tuesday. The waiter promptly brought us coffee and water while we looked over the menu. My friend recommended the Salmon scramble, which was really great. I ordered the California Crepes. When the man from the kitchen came out with our dishes, he simply held them out to us but didn't specify what they were or who they were for. It was pretty confusing but we quickly figured it out. My California crepes did not come with any avocado as advertised, but were still pretty good otherwise (there was also no difference in price or warning, but I was too hungry to bring it to their attention). Potatoes were done well. My friends enjoyed their meals, including the sourdough bread. Nothing super special about this place, but a really solid place to sit down and have a meal.

Right below the famous Lombard zig zag this is a conveniently located spot with great breakfast options. I had the spinach omelet which was so fresh and delicious.

It almost an hour after we were seated and ordered and our food still hadn't come out. The woman working the register could not get the bills straight. This added to the wait. We witnessed another patron send her food back and it did not come back. They finally asked about their food and the waiter brought it back; it was cold and it was not fixed as they had ordered it.I finally had to tell the waiter to pack our food to go because the extended wait made us late to our appointment. This was breakfast! There is no reason for pancakes, omelettes, and bacon to take an hour!Don't eat here if you actually want to get your food and eat it. Terrible service and total apathy to its patrons.

I had the day off so I came here on a weekday morning. The place was not crowded at all, so my friend and I were seated right away.Weird dining experience.. not sure why my napkin looked like it was used already. And when my friend and I began to suspect the kitchen had forgotten about our order, we asked the server about it and she said she would go see what's going on. But she was pleasant and made sure everything else was fine.I ordered the breakfast burrito (choice of meats: ham or chorizo) which was nothing special. It tasted a little too cheesy. But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm sure any other choice from their menu would've made my breakfast experience better. They have a ton of different options, which I wish I would have tried instead. Like the eggs benny, waffles, biscuits and gravy, or the French toast. Order took a little too long, especially taking into consideration the few people dining in. But it could be that our order was skipped by accident-totally okay, it happens. I think I have to retry this place on a different day and order something else.

I have traveled the globe in my Holy Grail quest for the perfect pancakes.....Aruba, Toronto, Bavaria Germany, Constantinople, Ho Chi Minh, Rio De Jinero.....they all have wonderful concoctions in their own right. But here.... here in a quaint hole in the wall called Pat's in San Francisco California.....they may make the most interesting pancakes in the world....Now, I don't always order pancakes, but when I do....I may just prefer Pat's banana granola pancakes. Stay hungry, my friends.The other cool vibe about this place, besides the kickass pancakes, is the awesome vibrant, acid trippy yellows, reds and oranges which surround you. Livens up your day a bit....we all could use a splash of color. And, again, it is a mom and pop shop, which my home state of Maryland so desperately needs. I love traveling, partly cuz I get to experience the little guys like this. I also bought one of the photography prints hanging on the wall from a local, amature craftsman. It had the view of the city I so wished I could capture on my simple $240 smart phone.Good food, good atmosphere, good service....5 stars.

I finally got to experience a true "Joe's Special Scramble"! I've made this dish b4 for my Georgia family, and on my recent trip to SF, stumbled into this little colorful gem on the early morning of my departure and was thrilled to see it on their menu. The server - nice, quick and attentive - didn't know what I was talking about when I gushed about the origins of the dish and how me, a Southern gal, was so excited to have the real thing, but that's OK. The food was amazing, and I'm so glad that I found Pat's rather than settling for crummy airport food.

There is clearly history at Pat's cafe. And I appreciate it for it, I truly do. There is that good old smell of breakfast that overwhelms your senses the moment you walk in. This place doesn't stand out in any sense other than it's "normalness". And I mean that in the best way possible. Although you will find a man bun or two at Pats, this is an establishment with an old soul, old, non-pretentious receptors and satisfying menu. My only negative mark is the service. The young fellows are very nice and friendly, and very responsive when you reach it and ask for their attention...but unless you as a customer do that step, you will be waiting...and waiting and waiting and waiting. It took 10 mins for someone to take my order. It's not something that will keep me from coming back here in the future, but staff attentiveness and anticipation are definitive areas for improvement.

We stopped by here for a quick bite to eat on our way up to Muir Woods. I think we hit that golden spot on a Saturday morning where people are still in bed nursing Friday night off, regardless at 8:45 in the morning we were able to grab a seat in the back. However, 20 minutes later the place was packed!We ordered two coffees and split the corned beef hash and California crepe. Both portions were generous without encouraging obesity. Loved the flavor on their corned beef and house potatoes. California crepe had applewood chicken sausage, sauteed onions, cheddar cheese and avocados. It was flat out delicious (it does normally come with mushroom but I don't dig on fungus).Service was prompt and attentive.Simple food done right and great service. Really that is all I ask for in a meal.

This is by far my favorite breakfast and brunch place in SF. I've since moved to another city, but I make sure every time I come back I go eat at Pat's. You'll recognize the place by the cutout of Pat standing in front of the diner.

Seems like it does not matter which day you visit, this place has their usual customers + tourists like us :) So as soon as you walk in, reach to list to put your name and do not get far from the scene :) Or your name will be crossed. That's fair though. We got lucky with 2 seats at the bar after 15 minutes await. Meanwhile you can check the photographs on walls which are for sale. We ordered our coffees right away. Coffee cups were a bit stained, but their being branded was cute. We then asked for an eggs florentine and a burrito, on Sunday, took about 40-45 minutes. We did not mind waiting since we are on vacation but if rushing, you can ask for an estimated serving time. Eggs Florentine ! Deliciouss! Their home-made sauce is so good and eating whole dish, you feel like " hell yeah, I made a favor for myself today " :)Pat seems as a nice lady even we did not have a chance to meet. I loved her red earrings she had on :) She has her eye on everything going on around and I'm sure that's the key to success. Hope to visit again when we are in SF.

Pat's not my typical breakfast place that I would go to (I don't spend that much time in North Beach/Fisherman's Wharf), but it has a west coast American breakfast feel to it (not to be confused with those New Jersey/New York diners). I came here with four of my relatives (who are not from the US) to show them a more traditional American breakfast. FOOD: I got the Mexican omelet and found it to be quite tasty. The slight bits of chorizo and bell peppers peppered throughout the omelet. Pretty basic, but executed well. Honestly, Pat's location is what makes this place. The food itself was decent, but it is what you would expect of a traditional breakfast place. Also, decent vegetarian options as my relatives were vegetarian. Kudos for Pat's for keeping in mind non-meat eaters!

Kiddos and I wanted a reasonably priced breakfast close to our hotel on the wharf that had good pancakes, this was the place! Kids had pancakes with bacon and eggs and I had Pat's hash. The portions were huge and price was similar to what I would pay in Denver at la place like the pancake house. Food came out fast which was good since my kids were really hungry. They are pancake lovers and said these were very good and corn beef was tasty and had nice big chunks. Definitely recommend!

Stopped in Pat's for lunch before doing a trolley tour. The staff was friendly, and we were promptly greeted. The service was quick and pleasant. We weren't in the mood for breakfast food, but the menu was very tempting! I ordered the tuna salad sandwich on sourdough with a side salad, and my husband got the tuna melt on wheat with fries. Both sandwiches were excellent. I especially enjoyed the side salad with apple slices and a tangy dressing. The restaurant is bright and cheerful, and I enjoyed looking at the beautiful photographs on the walls. Pat was telling another patron that business had been slow, and that she sure was hoping it picks up soon. I really hope more locals (and tourists) will visit Pat's Cafe. You won't be disappointed!

If you can't stomach the wait for the acclaimed Hollywood Cafe, do make the trek out to Pat's Cafe for some simple and delicious food. The service staff is very friendly and there's also free WiFi!Their hot chocolate is absolutely amazing because they use Ghiradelli chocolate. Now for the food:Joe's Special: It's pretty much a breakfast scramble, with eggs, ground beef, spinach, mushrooms and onions. Ingredients were very fresh but this breakfast entree didn't blow me away taste-wise. The garlic toast was surprisingly good!(3.5/5 stars)Eggs on Toast: On toast? The eggs were pretty much inside the toast. The egg was delicious but the toast was a bit dry. Sausage links were overcooked a little too much for my personal liking. (3/5 stars).If you can't wait for Hollywood's massive line and feel ashamed to eat brunch at Denny's or the other 2000 corporate chain restaurants near Fisherman's Wharf, Pat's Cafe will not leave you disappointed.

Let me tell you about how I wore a camouflage sweater.I must have blended in with the wall or something. My husband and I were in town and turned to Yelp for some suggestions. We were seated and greeted by our waiter right Away. He seemed kinda clueless as to why we were there. Anyway I ordered a Mexican omelette not available for whatever reason. Then I asked about waffles guy said he wasn't sure if he had them . This place is a joke. Everything u order on the menu is either not in stock or sold out. After seeing an older lady in her mid 70'S fret everyone and ask if everything was okay for the last 20 minutes we finally came to the decision she was no where close to greeting us !!. Proudly we are a Hispanic people with a huge "nopal" in our foreheads . We discovered this place isn't color friendly !!! Fuck these people.

We then waited again for ages even thou there were less than 8 people in the cafe. When it finally arrived it was generally lacking Chicken but had all the bacon ....Then we tried to ask for Mayo - it finally arrived after another 10 minutes and others had all had their food order.Over all my worse US food experience. It was expensive and not worth the cost. It's a pity as it could have been great.I'd stick to subway or Starbucks who actually care about their customers.

I went alone then was seated and served immediately. I enjoyed the food very much. The Eggs Blackbear, one of their personal favorites, was delicious and filling! It's fair to say that it's one of my favorites now after that meal. They used bacon in place of ham typical of an Eggs Benedict.The ambience was great, full of life. The waiters made sure I had something to drink while ordering and consistently checked up if I was alright. I truly enjoyed my brunch. Just an observation - those in groups are more likely to wait a while before getting seated as opposed to those who go alone like I did.

i was originally planning on going to Mama's but it was nearly noon new year's day and just didn't have the patience for the ridiculous line there so we went to Pat's! greatest decision everthis place is quite small. very colorful. we only waited like 5 minutes to be seated. i ordered the mexican scramble, my bf had the SF omelette i think it was called and my brother had the eggs in a hole. and we had an order of pancakes to share. trust me when i tell you the pancakes are TO DIE FOR. ever since then, my mouth has been watering for those delicious buttery soft pancakes. never have i ever had a better pancake. and i don't even like pancakes that much. i never order pancakes. but i will definitely be coming back probably this weekend for some pancakes. everything else was delicious too, especially the house potatoes they give you. they're very soft yet crispy. just really good.ALSO they had really good iced coffee which most breakfast cafes don't seem to have, so that's definitely a plus. see you guys this weekend.

Yes, yes, YES! Talk about exactly what I want every time I go out for brunch. This place is small, service is slow, and it's popular- so be warned that if you're on a time constrant it's not the way to go. Even so, if you have some time to lazily sip on your coffee while eating some of the best brunch foods you can imagine, Pat's Cafe is where it's at. A few of the highlights: - The crab cake eggs benedict was amazing. As good as you can imagine the combination of those two foods, it's even better. -The french toast is made of sour dough bread slices. It's more amazing than you can imagine. -Service when we went and needed a table for 6 was slow, almost non-existant to a frustrating level. However, the quality and taste of the food made up for the long wait in my book. I will definitely be back to try more of their food the next time I'm in town. 5 stars for food, 3 for service = 4 overall.

Hands down the best hollandaise I've ever had in my life. Excellent service as well. My wife ordered the hash and it came with assorted bell peppers in it which my wife has a mild allergy to (her lip curls and she sighs excessively). We asked (who we presume the owner to be, who was checking on tables) if we could order something else. The new order was rushed out right away and the other dish comp'd. Great service, greats of, great atmosphere. Nothing less than 5 stars here.

Strange smell inside. Awful smell, actually. But, if you stick it out, the Californian crepe and pomegranate juice is spectacular! If it weren't for the smell, I'd probably give it 5 stars. It's something difficult to overlook for most, though.

I've been here once before- got a breakfast burrito. Mediocre and shitty service.I assumed it came with salsa, so when my food arrived and it was missing, I asked for some. They charged me.Was back in town looking at Yelp and saw people rating it nicely, decided to go and realized quick it was a place I'd been. Walked in anyway, a Thursday at 730am, so not a hugely busy time.So now my actual review: NOPE- don't come here. My huge party of 2 watched as people that came in after us got drinks and enjoyed placing their order. We just sat there, with our menus to the side to let the sever know we were ready to order. He passed us, he made eye contact and continued to walk, I don't know, maybe he internally laughed at not bringing us water or acknowledging us as customer, who knows?Anyway, we walked out as the guy behind us got to order right in our ears. Since he came in well after us, that was the last straw. Decided to walk over to mama's on Washington square and that was the right decision! Even with the wait, the staff was so kind and friendly and the food demolished pat's.

Ate here twice while in San Francisco twice twice last week and enjoyed breakfast very much! It was about 2 blocks from our hotel which was very handy. The people were friendly, helpful and accommodating. The food was delicious and portions large enough to share (which we did!)

Lovely small place with warm and welcoming interior. Great food, freshly made and cooked to order.It is a perfect breakfast location. Not only because of the great service which is kind and fast, but also for the physical location in a short walking distance to the piers and Fisherman's Wharf.They probably serve lunch as well, I'm not sure about it since we came in and asked only about breakfast. If they do serve other menus I'm sure it must be good as well.

We had brunch here over the weekend and it was amazing. The service was a little slow and no one greeted us for about 10 minutes at our table but the food was so good it made up for it. The owner Pat took our order and recommended the French toast so I went with that. You have to try this French toast. It's like the softest piece of bread ever (I think it was sourdough) and the sasauge was also good. Didn't try the salmon eggs Benedict but my friend seemed to like it. Oh - I also tried the pancakes and they were pretty tasty too. So happy to have found a nearby brunch spot without lines around the block!

This place was near our hotel by Fisherman's Wharf. We woke up and walked on over after I found it on Yelp. I loved the eggs Benedict with their very own Hollandaise sauce. Simply delicious. Along with their home fries, it was a special breakfast dish. And the coffee in their own Pat's coffee San Francisco mug was so fresh and delicious. What a breakfast experience too. Pat herself was there and helped us out. Very warm and friendly. She socializes with all the patrons and really makes you feel like you are visiting her home.

My family and I arrived in San Francisco after a crazy impulse...we had no plans or specific destination but found Pat's Cafe and it didn't dissapoint. Waitress was nice and attentive. I gave it 4 stars because of the price of my crepe...other than that it was a good place.
