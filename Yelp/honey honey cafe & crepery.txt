Food: Ordered the crab cake florentine and my sister ordered 2, 2,and 2 with sausage. The crab cake was a bit bitter. The eggs benedict left my mouth feeling dry for some reason and my stomach feeling queasy. The potatoes were the only decent thing on the plate. Tried the scrambled eggs on my sister's plate and was pretty bland. My sister also did not like her plate and said that Denny's tasted better.Wait: We started waiting in line just outside the door and it was quite a wait (around half an hour) to get to ordering food.Service: decent but didn't really do much except bring food to you. Everything else was pretty much self-service.Price: A bit over priced for the quality. Around $14 for crab cake florentine. The 2,2, and 2 was around $12. It's around $4 for a side of bacon which is only around 2-3 pieces.Conclusion: Not recommend and will not be coming back

Very busy place! Went there around noon and they were packed. I was able to find a seat though. The staff was attentive and polite. Food came out very quickly. I ordered the North Beach crepe with potatoes. The potatoes were not good at all. They were cold and a mix between burnt and/or sitting out for a long time. I hope that was a one off. The crepe was very delicious though! An ample amount of filling for the size. I'd definitely go back and try another flavor.

Some quick notes:- they could really use some signage upon entering instructing diners that you order at the front and are assigned a table while waiting in line. You can't miss the line. - extremely touristy spot- excellent lattes- expect to wait about 20-30 minutes it's a popular place - prices on the website are less than advertised in restaurant- odd layout and definitely needs signage to instruct customers on how their system works - nice big menu to view while waiting in line immediately to the right upon entering- old school feel to this joint- no outside seating - carb lovers dream - would recommend the crepes or waffles- they looked fantastic but can attest their omelettes are extremely fluffy - great variety and interpretations of breakfast- many options. lunch items too - fresh squeezed OJ or carrot juice- they serve beer & wine

When it comes to a place that serves crepes... 1- It's hard to find a good spot with multiple options for both sweet and savory. 2- It's hard to find a place that not only serves crepes, but much, much more. 3- It's hard to find a delicious "breakfast/brunch" crepe spot that doesn't close at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. This place checked off so many boxes in my book. Open until the evening, the food was absolutely amazing, and they had quick service. We liked it so much we ate here twice in two days. Highly recommended.

Honey, Honey is a cute, quaint cafe. They have an excessive menu that you'll find yourself wanting to order at least one item off of each handwritten chalkboard. The only setbacks are: the extremely long lines (practically out the door), one occupancy restroom, & customer service is kinda horrible but sure I accept that for the kinda traffic they get in here. The eggs Benedict was delicious and on point, and the potatoes served with them were even more memorable. They had the perfect crisp & flavor to them. Their pancakes were light & fluffy which were a great pair with the fresh strawberries. No food was wasted here, plates were wiped clean. Note: you stand in line to order your food, they give you a number stand and you seat yourself, your food is then brought out to your table. If I'm ever back in SF this place will definitely be a breakfast spot I'd love to return to.

I'll start by saying that in order for me to ever come on Yelp and give a restaurant one star the situation truly has to be grim. We came here off of a friends recommendation (they hadn't eaten here yet, they saw the reviews on Yelp) and after verifying the 4 star rating on Yelp we figured it'd be ok to try this place out. We ordered a cheese and ham croissant with house potatoes and French toast and a tofu egg scramble along with house potatoes. The food came out and it looked promising.As soon as we began eating my husband started picking through his potatoes. For whatever the reason something caught his attention. To our horror he pulled out an insect about half an inch long that resembled a cockroach/cricket. Long legs and definitely some sort of wings.He pulled it out of his potatoes and we calmly got the attention of a man who seemed to be the manager or head chef (not sure). He came over, looked at the bug on the table which we explained was in the potatoes and without saying a word went and summoned the cashier. (Not even an apology or sign of some sort of shame or remorse that this is the food coming out of his kitchen.) The cashier came over to our table and when we showed her the bug she at-least apologized and offered us a refund. Needless to say, we took our money and left. I have never had such an experience. I would truly reconsider coming and eating at this establishment. Disgusting to say the least. Clearly, there is an issue with kitchen cleanliness and that's a problem.I truly regret not taking a photo of the bug as initially I wasn't going to come on here and write this review. But it would b a disservice to anyone coming to eat here and not making them aware of the posible risk.

This place was mediocre. My husband and I are from LA and decided to go to SF for a spontaneous trip. Was looking for a delicious breakfast spot so we decided to try this place out based on it's high ratings. My order was a New Orleans savory crepe-- chicken breast was dry. Crepe was dryMy husband ordered their popular Philly cheesesteak crepe--crepe was not as flavorful as we expected. Not much meat. Overall, the long line was not worth it for the food quality.

Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning and my goodness, this place was packed! (Which I think is expected on a Sunday morning, but still). What I really liked about this place is that you don't need to wait to get seated and wait for someone to take your order. You get in line and once your right about next in line, someone will ask how many is in your party and save a table for you! I got the chorizo scramble and it was so so so so yummy! It's a good amount of food and it comes with toast. My friends both got their crabcake clementine which I tried and it was amazing. I suggest ordering these items. Definitely worth it.

After a hangry walk around the block trying to find a place for brunch, we decided to stop here because the reviews seemed pretty good! There's a huge menu display when you walk in and you order what you want at the register and they'll bring it to you. I'm indecisive and everything sounded so good, but I settled with the Half Moon Bay savory crepe. The crepe is thick... like thick thick. The crab cake was kinda bland and definitely needed more salt. I really like the concept of crab cakes in a crepe though. It comes with a choice of fresh fruit or potatoes! I got the fresh fruit, and you can see them slice tons of fresh fruit in the back. There's an orange squeezer for fresh orange juice and it tastes pretty darn good. Seating can be limited, especially if it's gets busier. The staff is friendly so overall, a great experience!

I've been meaning to try this place for a while and was excited to finally try it one weekday night. It's great this place is close to union square and also closes at 10pm, which is later than a lot of the places in the area. The place sort of reminds me of crepevine with the menu boards and the type of food offered. You order at the counter and they'll give you a number and bring your food to your table. The lighting in here is weirdly dark, which was something I did not like. I hope during the day it's brighter due to natural lighting. We ordered a nutella with banana crepe. It was really delicious with a good amount of nutella and banana inside but it was nothing special really. I love crepes but this crepe for almost $10 was certainly not worth it. Maybe if there was something special about it it would've felt more worth but I probably wouldn't come back for it again. I do kind of wonder why the ratings for this place are so high so maybe their savory crepes are more tasty and delicious and worth the price tag.

This cafe was a great brunch spot for my group as it gave us enough energy for an afternoon of shopping! I ordered the pesto crepe with a side of potatoes. The chunks of feta could have been crumbled more to have a more uniform flavor throughout the crepe. I found a couple really large chunks that made those few bites overly salty. After I broke it into smaller pieces, it was much more palatable. The potatoes were very tasty and well prepared. Great texture of potato (not hard, but not mushy) and good flavor as well. Their seating is quite plentiful and they were rather smart in their seating process. While you are standing in line, an employee assigns you a table and you let the cashier know which table you were assigned. The food you ordered is then brought to you. If someone tries to steal your table while you're in line, the employee will kindly ask them to sit elsewhere. Overall, great experience here.

Went here for a late brunch seeing as how it was incredibly close to where I was staying. The place was barely 2 streets away.I ordered the crab cake benedict, my mother ordered the chocolate Belgian waffle, and my dad ordered the Miami Heat crepe. The crab cake was good. It was slightly on the "fishy" side of the taste spectrum which personally I enjoyed, but I know others might not. The potatoes were crispy and slightly overdone, which is how I like my potatoes but again, others might dislike this. The Belgian waffle was well done. It was properly portioned and quite aesthetically pleasing. It wasn't outstanding but it's not like I expected it to be some five-star Michelin diner. The Miami heat crepe was a highlight. The dough was so soft and the ingredients inside were fresh and full of flavor. The atmosphere was alright. Same old diner type setting. I do have to comment on the sanitation of the place. It's relatively dirty compared to the rest of the places we've visited in the city. The cups for water seemed really old but at least the service was decent. 3/5. Decent food but nothing outstanding. Basic diner setting. Decent service.

A quaint little spot for breakfast & lunch. Parking garage nearby on Taylor & walking distance to the pop-up Color Factory. Be prepared for a long wait to order. Took us about 30 min on Tuesday around 11am to order but the meals came out within 10 min. We were a group of seven & they were able to get us a table fairly soon after ordering. I ordered the Salsa savory crepe - super good - with fruit, a cappuccino (almost got the OJ) & the SBK sweet crepe - very yummy - with ice cream. I enjoyed the food but not sure I am dying to go back, hence the one star deficit. But definitely a great spot if you're in the area & have some time to spend.

Yum! First, it was refreshing to walk into an intimate restaurant in SF without tripping over a homeless person. Honey Honey also has clean restrooms and a spacious dining area. We tried the fettuccini franchese, the salsa crepe and the club with fries. The Alfredo sauce was so rich and creamy (and the bread rocked too). The club was made on sourdough and my husband called the fries "perfectly cooked". I opted for the salsa crepe and it was AMAZING. Admittedly, it was my first crepe, but if they're all like this...YUM! You do order at a counter and have the food brought to you, but they were very polite. So far this is one of my faves in SF!

Ordered a PB&J before going to the Commonwealth Club last night because I thought it would be quick. Got a regular butter & J instead and when I went back to ask for PB on it, I was told that if I hadn't been in a hurry they could have checked to make sure it was correct. Oh! I see. My fault. 3 stars because the PB&J, when I finally got it, was good!UPDATE: I got a reply message from the restaurant claiming that no one was blaming me, but then, in the same message, blaming me again:"Being in a hurry doesn't give you the right to make me not double check the order before it's being delivered to you..."The restaurant also made sure I knew that the PB was added "on the house without extra charges," which makes no sense because that's what I ordered and was already charged for. Lowering my number of stars due to this strange and argumentative response - still blaming the customer. Strange way to do business.

Deeeee LISH!And such a big menu! When I came here on a Monday morning, was shocked to find the line going out the door, ouch. But crepes sounded amazing so we decided to wait it out, plus it gave plenty of time to deliberate between the many, many things on the menu. The board is beautiful and very easy to read (once you get to the inside part of the line). We figured there would be no chance to sit down, luckily people move in and out pretty fast and it's a large space. Furthermore, a staff member is constantly cleaning tables and asking how many you have in your group in order to get you seated. I ordered the Miami Heat, so good! Generous amounts of avocado and cheddar. And the heat was there! My friend got a strawberry Nutella crepe, I tried a bite and was in heaven. Love how you have the option of fruit or potatoes, definitely went for the fruit and it was so fresh. Prices are also extremely reasonable, especially for the area! Worth the wait, and trust me, you'll be waiting!

Very average place. There's a huge menu upon entering, but it could use more variety. My friend wanted a savory crepe with chicken apple sausage, and none of them came with it, but it was available as a side. Sounds kind of odd to me.I ordered the North Beach crepe, which was filled with spinach, chicken breast, onions and Swiss cheese, topped with hollandaise sauce. My order came out only mildly warm. We were the only other party there at the time (~5:30pm on a weekday). The hollandaise sauce was also very bland, which was a major disappointment since it was the thing that intrigued me about the dish. The whole crepe was very mediocre. I tried my friend's eggplant crepe, which tasted a little better but was still nothing special. I ordered fruit as a side, and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a couple of days. Would I come back? Maybe, maybe not. I'd prefer crevevine though.

My bestie invited a mutual friend and myself here for brunch. We had a "day in the city" planned out and this was our first stop. Although the line appeared overwhelmingly long, the wait time was actually pretty short; it was actually perfect timing as our trio decided on what we were each going to order. There's plenty to choose from on the menu! I chose the breakfast crepe. It was relatively good, I like a lot of flavor, which the crepe lacked, but it wasn't anything a little bit of Tabasco couldn't fix. The potatoes were DELICIOUS! They were well-seasoned and well-prepared! I also ordered a mimosa, which tasted good but was kind of on the warm side. It would have been delicious had it been served cold! My bestie ordered a waffle, and our other friend ordered the French toast; both were very good! Overall, the service was good, the staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely go back and absolutely recommend it!

I loved this place! You wait in line to order then you sit down and they bring you your food. The wait was about 30 minutes to order and 5 minutes for the food. I ordered the baklava crepe and my mom ordered the chorizo scramble. I also ordered an iced chai tea. The baklava crepe was really good and tasted just like baklava. I wish that pistachios were used on the inside of the crepe to give a more traditional taste. The chorizo scramble was pretty tasty and came with potatoes and toast. I would recommend getting the regular chai tea instead of the iced. This place is great for breakfast and brunch!

This place is severely under rated in my opinion.The wife and I walked here after checking out another place that was higher rated but was too busy.You do need to order before you sit, so we had about a 10 minute wait before we were able to order. While waiting, a gentlemen came around and let us know which table number we would sit at, so you do not need to fight over seating.My wife had a sandwich which she thoroughly enjoyed. I had the pesto crepe which was phenomenal. We shared the Blintz Dessert Crepe and that was a visual masterpiece (see our picture). The prices are extremely fair for what you get and the food was plentiful. My wife and I will be back next time we visit San Francisco.

Without a doubt this place has delicious food and their orange juice is fresh squeezed. Beware- of those cups that are piled up for you to grab and serve yourself either a lemon lime or orange water from their dispenser. Just poured myself some water, sat down and saw what looked like chapstick lip remnants on my cup. I wiped it and sure enough I was right. Gross.Tip- buy a beverage and you'll get a fresh glass. When your done with your drink refill with the water. Hope this helps!

Okay..... was super excited to try this place... and well... I gotta say... service is everything.We walk in and stand at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone helped us... and we were the only ones "in line", and the place was pretty slow. We orders the Philly Cheese Steak Crepe with breakfast potatoes on the side for my babe and the Half Moon Bay Crepe with avocado and fries instead of the potatoes for me.Our order arrives and mine has potatoes (which, by the way we're over salted), so I asked her about the fries.. she said the fries will be on the side... I was like okay? I said instead...... but nope.. she put it on the side, and we were charged and NOT TOLD THAT THEY CANT CANT SUBSTITUTE UNTIL THE FOOD ARRIVED!!! So... we did into our food and the avocado was in the wrong Crepe (babe is allergic)... So we tell them and she said "let me check if they can remake it." What? Check? You served someone the wrong food and you have to check?! Whatever, so I asked her to just bring my avocado on the side so they don't have to remake mine... so she did... the tiniest piece of avocado.. sliced.. they charge extra for avocado.. a dollar.. which is usually fine... but usually places give you a good amount.. take Chipotle and their guac for example. Last thing.... when you place the order at the counter, you pay right away and there is a tip option... which basically forces you to leave a tip unless you click other and type in 0.00................ I'm usually a great tipper... but crap like this makes me not wanna tip....Even though.... I did leave a tip because I was expecting it to be better and the service was shitty after we paid... great...Not coming back here again... there's better crepe places with much better service. Crepe tastes good though.

This was a great breakfast place! The menu is huge--savory crepes, dessert crepes, omelets, pancakes, French toast, Belgian waffles, as well as lunch items. The seating process is a little confusing. The line went out the door & moved slowly. What happens is you wait in line for a table to open up. The huge menu is up on the wall as you wait in line so you can mull over what to order. As you get close to the counter to order, a host will ask how many are in your party & assign you a table with a number. When you order & pay, you tell them your table number. Then you immediately sit down & just wait for your food. The food came relatively quickly & hit the spot. We each had a crepe--the half moon (which was the least favorite) & the breakfast crepe (which was yummy) & we shared the pecan pancakes which were amazing, by far the standout of the meal.

They have such great team work to take care of you! They are really efficient in getting people in and out and they are great at not making you feel rushed all, all at the same time. Food was great. Space is a little tight. I had my baby with me, we left her stroller outside and just put her car seat on one of her booths :) the only thing I would say is that they need to have a separate line for people who have ordered online, someone who ordered online cut in front of me and I had already been waiting about 45 minutes, so it may just be easier for everyone

Mediocre crepes for ~$12 with tax. Good place if you have a breakfast craving - they've got egg scrambles, waffles and pancakes amongst their large menu of sandwiches and salads.If you're looking for crepes, alternative crepes locations: st Germain has buckwheat batter, crossroads cafe is cheaper (~$9)- MIAMI HEAT CREPE ($11.91): chicken tasted like it belonged in a burrito and crepe batter was forgettable. Ok amount of avocado, mushrooms weren't really cooked - STRAWBERRY AND NUTELLA CREPE (~$8): strawberries too mushy and Nutella tasted more like chocolate syrup. Too sweet overall, including the ice cream that came with itService relatively slow (to order and receive food). Water cups smelled super heavily of bleach... Had to ask for a disposable cup. Outdoor seating available.

Insane wait for standard diner breakfast food, but it's one of the few breakfast places whose sole specialties is *not* toast.

I can't believe so many people like this place. The fettuccine with pesto was actually a cream soaked pesto. It doesn't say cream on the menu for that item. I sent it back and got Chicken Parm.

We tried to have breakfast at this place a few times while visiting SF and staying at hotels in the area prior to moving here full time. Every time we tried to have breakfast at Honey Honey, the line was out the door. Some how we beat the rush and got in. The line behind us, grew quickly and the place was filled before I knew it. I had a veggie omelet type crepe thing, and my boyfriend had pancakes and eggs. The food was delicious and probably only took about 15 minutes to cook. NOTE: this is not a fancy brunch place. You order your meal at the counter, and then find a seat yourself and the employees will bring out your food to your table. It's a simple place but definitely worth checking out.

This joint was a block away from our hotel and we were tired of grab and go food, so we decided to give this a try. Like almost every other restaurant in the area, it's an order and pay at the counter situation. At least they had table service. You order, pay, grab your number, and hope you can find a table. Fortunately it was quick turnaround for most so we didn't have to wait for a table. The line to order goes out the door and never appeared to slow so we had high hopes for good food. I ordered the Post St omelet with potatoes and he ordered the chicken something crepe with fresh fruit. Both were large and tasty, came out quickly, and the service we did experience was positive.

Crab Cake Florentine...yay or nay? I'd actually say I've had better. After wandering to Coit Tower and building up an appetite, my friend and I looked on Yelp for places near Union Square to have brunch at. We found Honey Honey and looked at the Yelp photos and decided the crab cake florentine looked good (and we were starving and tired of walking). When we got there, the line was out the door. We'd wait in that line for another 30 minutes before having our order taken. When we finally got inside, there were four menu boards with many items. It was at that point when my friend and I realized we'd been here before and hadn't been impressed. However since we were hungry and because of other positive reviews, we decided to stay. We both ordered the crab cake florentine which also included a side of country potatoes. The presentation of the dish was definitely photo worthy and the poached egg was nicely done. However, upon eating the crab cake I was turned off. It was pretty salty and fishy tasting. At one point, I even ate a shell and had to spit it out after hearing it crunch between my teeth. So why 2.5-3 stars? The service was excellent. The place is small and so I was concerned about finding a table but they indicate where you can sit when you're about to order. Once we ordered, we only waited maybe 7 minutes for our food to come out. The poached eggs were done well though one was more runny than the other. I did like the seasoning on the country potatoes. My friend felt a little sick after we left and we don't know if we can attribute it to her dish. We've decided to pass on this restaurant in the future but it seems like others enjoy it so it may be personal preference in this case.

This is one of the better brunches I've ever had. I ordered the Milano Eggs and a pesto chicken crepe. Both were astonishingly delicious. Perfect blend of cheese, garlic, and pesto basil which left me craving for more. I'm definitely coming back for more!

There was a line when we arrived at 11:00 on Friday. We waited about 20 minutes and were able to get a table after ordering. The crab cake Florentine was okay, but the Nutella banana crepe was AMAZING!

Updated review
Our hotel concierge recommended Honey Honey after a long flight to San Fran and I'm so glad he did. The breakfast was likely one of the best I've ever had. I wish I could remember the names of the items but my husband had the crab eggs benedict and I had the most divine omelet was black beans and avocado. The fresh OJ mimosas made the meal. It was likely one of the best and certainly the most reasonably priced meals of our stay.

Meh. For the long wait (around an hour and fifteen minutes), it didn't quite live up to our expectations. Firstly, the seating situation is really weird - basically you're supposed to be seated after you order your food; however random lazy people in the back of the line will run to empty seats first while people at the front of the line are waiting to be seating. Kinda weird set up overall as the massive line to order extends throughout the restaurant and winds by your table while you're eating. The bench seat tables are also very awkward - high benches with low tables, so your thighs are kinda squashed while eating. So, I got the breakfast crepe, which was pretty good - not long-wait good, but a hefty amount of eggs. I appreciated that they were able to make substitutions with no extra cost as well. Husband got the croissant sandwich - the side potatoes were the best part (seriously, they were some of the best O'Brien potatoes ever) unfortunately; the sandwich itself was very underwhelming, with runny eggs and a croissant that looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for a few days. Overall, wouldn't recommend.

A little above average. Honestly the lost remarkable thing about the restaurant was the line out the door that kept moving at a reasonable pace for the food. I'd have expected something somewhat remarkable for the wait, but I guess that's just par for San Francisco with all the tourists. Anyway, service was brisk. I ordered the sunrise burrito and was served in 5 minutes. It was decent, though I think I'd try something else next time as it wasn't all that special. Coffee was Ok. If you want to eat here it's a pretty safe bet.

I came here on a Wed around 12:30 p.m. seriously no line, so maybe that's the time to go. Anyways food was decent nothing outstanding. Service could of been friendlier all the girls looked so sad. The food came out fairly quickly and the place is well runned, always movin. The bathrooms were pretty much clean, they have free wifi. The place can get really stuffy and warm, they had to keep the door open to get some fresh air so idk what's up with that. I'd recommend, it's simple food but I personally won't be going back.

3.5 starsCame here for brunch a couple weeks ago, it's walking distance from the Westin St. Francis. Approached the restaurant around 10:15am and noticed a line of about 10-15 people outside, but there were another 20-25 in the line that continued inside the restaurant. The line moved pretty quickly, I think we were in line for about 30-35 mins during which I was able to study the menu, which is very extensive. I had to go with a crepe since this is a crepery after all. I customized my own crepe, which took the cashier person a few minutes to figure out how to charge me for. I got a crepe with spinach, cheese, and eggs with a side of fruit. I really liked the crepe itself and everything inside, the fruit cup was nice-but nothing special. My BF enjoyed his benedict and the breakfast potatoes that came with it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I found myself semi regretting not ordering the potatoes. Cute restaurant. One of those places where you order in front then sit yourself. We were a little worried about finding a place to sit, but there were plenty of tables after we ordered our food. Pretty quick turn around here with people enjoying their food, then vacating the tables for other customers.

Yelp Challenge: 6/100My boyfriend and I visited San Francisco during spring break and enjoyed breakfast at Honey Honey Cafe two out of the three days we stayed. The cafe runs on an impeccable seating system. By the time you've ordered, there will be an open seat for you. I ordered the salmon benedict with orange juice the first day and a tuna sandwich the following day. I prefer my orange juice cold and was a bit disappointed that it was lukewarm. My eggs were underpoached and were falling apart into mush before I could enjoy them. The tuna sandwich was great. The micro greens were a great addition for texture. Definitely make sure to have their complimentary infused waters as they are ice cold and refreshing. I'll be back!*Both days we dined in, I payed with a large bill and they were able to make change. This was an added bonus!

Really cute, good coffee and a large menu. I had the pancakes and they were very good. The lattes had great foam and I appreciate that.

The food was good but the service was horrible. The brought out the food for everyone else but took 50 minutes to bring out my Belgium waffle and when we would ask, they would respond "there's nothing we can do, you have to wait". Once it arrived they brought it with whip cream even though I asked for no whip cream (dairy allergy). And I asked about this and they yelled stating "what do you want me to do?!? I can remake it but you'll have to wait!!"

Long line even on a Monday morning, mostly full of tourists. I ended up ordering take out and was very satisfied with my crab cake florentine. Portions were so huge I couldnt finish it at all. The potatoes were nicely charred and the hollandaise sauce was thick and creamy. Loved it!

I'm disappointed that I didn't get a chance to come back here before my visit to SF ended, maybe again someday! I had the SBK crepe which is strawberry banana and kiwi, with whipped cream. It was good! Not my favorite crepe ever but one of the better meals I had in the area. I'd never had warm kiwi before and was surprised to find it had a taste similar to baked apple. Overall the crepe wasn't very sweet until I added the whipped cream, was somehow more on the savory spectrum. Kind of good if you don't want something overwhelmingly sweet. Friendly service, nice lunch or snack spot while exploring downtown.

My favorite breakfast place in SF, perfectly located near our hotel, of course. They have an enormous amount of dishes to choose from. As I am a pancake fanatic, I do not recall if I had other food. Anyway the pancakes are great! The coffee is also very good! Sometimes I went just for the coffee. If you are very hungry, however, stay away during lunch hours.. Then you'll have a line throughout the door and no place to sit. This might also occur in the morning, I wouldn't know as I was on vacation and my mornings were pretty late.

I was very pleasantly surprised by Honey Honey Cafe and Crepery! My friend and I walked in after trying to find a place to satisfy our brunch cravings. We ultimately settled on sharing two plates - crab cake florentine and a cheese blintz. The crab cake florentine was excellent. Crab cakes with hollandaise sauce is certainly an experience to have! I also really liked that the crab cakes had an ample amount of fresh crab instead of an overload on the breading. The blintz was also very good. The crepe was light and fluffy and housed a delicious mix of ricotta and strawberry preserves.The atmosphere is very similar to squat & gobble/crepevine but I was more impressed with the quality here. Entrees weren't too expensive and there were definitely some creative dishes that caught my eye. The scent of constantly fresh squeezed orange juice was also amazing (but $3.95/cup is pretty expensive).

Awesome breakfast! Came in with our 3 kids, so 5 of us total. The great menu had something for everyone. Great prices for the amount of food you get. We all loved the fresh squeezed orange juice. Over all this restaurant was very yummy and we would visit again if in the city.

HH was recommended by our hotel and we gave it a try since it was just a block away. We were warned there would be a long line, but we only waited about 5 mins on a Wed morning (10am). The line did get longer around 10:30. I'm not a fan of restaurants where you order first and then find a seat. The brunch food is just your basic breakfast and lunch food, nothing too special, but not too bad. The portions are huge so it's a good idea to share if you're not that hungry.

the guy at fron the register didn't remember that I just pay over 145.00 on lunch at the place. I come back to get water the guys really rude asking me to asking him to get water next time give me a poor looking stick eye. I said ok I apologize for it. then let's the store to never come back. you need to be nice to everyone... I will never bring my family back .
