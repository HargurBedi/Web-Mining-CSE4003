I'm Italian. I've tried a dozen Pizzeria's all over the city (specially in North Beach) and this is by far the best and most authentic Italian pizza. I'd rate it very good even if the place was located back home. The menu is filled with a good choice of authentic Italian options (no pineapple pizza).The dough is crunchy with optimal texture, good selection of original ingredients (they even have regional Italian specialties like Arancini, 'Nduja or Buffalo Mozzarella). As many good places, there's going to be a queue outside.

Pillowy pizza crust with a doughy consistency paired with creamy mozzarella and fresh tomato sauce was a dream come true. I could elaborate, but it really boils down to this.Turn down the volume in the restaurant and you've got yourselves 5 stars.

II Casaro was one of 3 places recommended by a local coworker to get Italian in the North Beach area. I looked at all three and this one had me sold on the mozzarella bar part of it. I LOVE fresh mozzarella. I went with another coworker and we got the castelvetrano olives and burrata mozzarella to start and they were delicious. The olives were normal olives (nothing special, olives are olives) but the burrata mozzarella was gooey and creamy and delicious.Since my coworker didn't eat meat, we got the Quattro Formaggi pizza, which is four cheese pizza which was also delicious. I remember leaving the restaurant realizing I just ate basically bread and cheese for dinner. Can't complain there!Their wine list seems to have a good selection - I got the prosecco and it was good, though I haven't had many bad proseccos.I feel bad I can't remember my server's name, but he was engaging and knowledgeable and helped us choose which mozzarella to get. Service was quick and it wasn't very full when we got there around 6 p.m. but when we left, there were people waiting outside.

Awesome authentic spot. We came by on Friday night around 7 and grabbed a couple seats at the bar without having to wait, but there were people waiting in line very soon after. The burrata was amazing, good priced wines, and the prosciutto pizza was also great. Definitely recommend sitting at the bar watching the magic happen. Service wasn't amazing but they were super busy and for the price I am okay with it. I will be back!

Pizza is my jam and Il Casaro serves up a pretty hot dish. The ambience here is pretty hip and loud, and would be a great and fun setting for a small group of friends. Although, if you have more than 4 people there's a good chance you won't be able to hear or make conversation with anyone but the person right next to you until you're both into yelling- which after a few drinks is actually totally fine, turns out. The service was on point and we had no problem digging into the menu. The cauliflower was definitely my favorite item. I'd go back for that alone but next time I won't be sharing. The olives were as to be expected and same for the shishito peppers. The arancini was good, filling, and piping hot but even after all that I somehow found myself regretting not getting the corn since they did the cauliflower so well and I would've loved to have drizzled some of their fantastic Calabrian chili oil on it. Just another reason to come back, I guess. The pizzas are around 10" but if you're a crust-hater like me it's worth noting that a significant number of those inches are taken up by toppingless crust. I'm just not a bread person and never have been so I'm usually always the person who has the plate full of crusty pizza ends at the end of the night and that was definitely the case here. I ate the center of the pizza and really enjoyed it, but when I lined up all the crust at the end it ended up being just shy of half the pizza. Personally, if I'm getting a pizza, I want the topping to go all the way to the edge of the crust... otherwise why not just order bread? I did LOVE their few but delicious add on topping options like a farm egg, the saltiest olives ever, mushrooms, and Calabrian chilies which are basically my favorite things for a pizza. For dessert I ordered myself a Nutella and banana pizza and less one slice, I ate the whole thing. And let the record show that with the dessert pizza they actually spread the toppings further so there's less crust. Yay! The pizzas were also priced really well with my base margarita being just $12. That's a price tag I'll definitely come back for as I have a friend who I know would absolutely love this 'za.

I have to admit, I was surprised to find such a great pizza joint in North Beach. If you're a Bay Area native, you know that this neighborhood (aka "Little Italy") is mostly home to cheesy tourist spots. But I'm happy to report that this Neapolitan pizzeria is legit.I had the Diavola pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, Italian salami, Calabrian peppers served on a thin, chewy crust). With each bite, my taste buds were shouting "Mamma mia!"It's actually quite a large pizza for one person, especially if you have an appetizer or two beforehand. I'd recommend sharing your pie with a friend. I could only eat half of mine, and wound up doggy-bagging the rest for lunch the next day. Though truth be told, by the time I got home, I couldn't help but dive back in to the leftovers. Yes, the pizza is that good.If pizza ain't your jam, Il Casaro has other tasty offerings. I highly recommend the Polpette al Sugo (meatballs with tangy tomato sauce); the Cavolfiori (Roasted cauliflower, capers, garlic, calabrian chili oil); and the Arancini (fried rice balls with melted cheese in the middle). Everything was de-lish!Service was friendly and fast. Keep in mind, this place gets crowded and loud. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this spot for an intimate date. And if you go with a group of 4 or more people, you'll have to shout to hear one another.My only gripe is that they don't take reservations. So if you come here, be prepared to wait. But believe me, this pizza is well worth it!

Wow, wow, wow. I came here with some coworkers for dinner and it was absolutely incredible! The dishes were exploding with flavor and I truly experienced a taste of Italy in every bite. Though busy on the regular, i'm sure. It has great vibes and an amazing window that makes it open-air. For apps, we ordered their cauliflower, olives, MEATBALLS {must!!}, and shishito peppers. Everything was so fresh and it was evident that they used fine ingredients and love in all of their dishes. The meatballs definitely stood out as some of the best that i've had. They had SO much flavor. For my pizza, I ordered the Il Casaro because DUH, it is named after the restaurant which i'm assuming means that it is probably a fan favorite. It was cooked to perfection with a chewy crust, fresh cheeses, prosciutto, and mushrooms. I would 100% recommend it, the thought still makes my mouth water.To finish, we got the Nutella and banana pizza because why not?! We were already carb-loading so another few pieces of doughy perfection won't do any more harm than has already been done. Anywho, if you're in the city and looking for 5-star, authentic pizza, Il Casaro will not disappoint!

We only had appetizers here but will be back for some kickass looking (and smelling) pizza, I'm sure! Il Casaro was part of our "tour" of little Italy in north beach so we decided to make this place our first stop, since it boasted being a mozzarella bar as well as a pizzeria. While I was disappointed to find out they only serve mozzarella and burrata but no special variations on either (served simply with arugula, tomatoes, and crusty pizza dough triangles), I was very happy with the quality of the burrata. It was delicious and I could have eaten 3 more servings, easily. We also got the roasted calamari and zucchini which was PERFECTLY cooked. My only critiques for both dishes - a touch of salt would have gone a long way on the calamari and an herb infused olive oil as an accoutrement for the pizza dough triangles - but maybe I'm being picky because other people were just slathering the burrata straight on the triangles. I was just happy eating it straight off the plate, lol.The place is small and packed - we got lucky that we were only two people and got seated at the pizza bar right away. We loved the show! I would probably refrain from bringing a large group, you'll be really cramped.

Not to be totally negative but I feel very compelled to leave this review after my friends and I eagerly drove to get what looked like the best Pizza in SF according to yelp. Well; soggy pizza is not appetizing or in any way authentic, neither is inferior quality ingredients. This is NOTHING like pizza in Italy or even New York/New Jersey/ Philadelphia. My photo speaks for itself.I got a margarita and my friend got the prosciutto. Both were undercooked and his toppings without flavor. Procuttto had that stale-old texture and no cured flavor. Shaved (Pecorino?) was also without any of the lovely tyrosine (this salty crystals in great cheese). My margarita had just two basil leafs on the whole pie :(When the pizza came to the table it did look great; exactly like the Yelp photos... but the finished product was so underwhelming in taste and texture! Being an east-coaster I've lived a life with good pizza. Save yourself the huge disappointment: go to Pizzetta 211 or Beretta. *Service was very good, atmosphere fun and clean, plus the staff was friendly so I'll leave a 2 rather than 1*

Loved it! Delicious thin crust pizza... shared the mortadella (Italian sausage) - thinly sliced! Came with white sauce and pistachios... and of course mozzarella! Definitely recommend it.Also tried the arancini and beet salad. Both good. Place got really busy by 7pm so get here early. If you like thin crust, come here.

Durning a Business trip to Oakland a group of coworkers and I decided to head to San Francisco one night. I stumbled across this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. OMG!! I am so happy that I did! Everything was amazing. We had the imported burrata and mozzarella in carroza for appetizers and both were so delicious. For the entree we couldn't decide so we decided to order a few pizzas along with lasagna and a calzone. The mozzarella on the pizza was extremely fresh. The crust was perfect. The evening was made perfect by the service. I can't recall the name of our server but she was so friendly and patient with our 20 questions. Her recommendations were on point. I can't wait to visit San Fran again to stop by for round 2!

Such good pizza, just like Italy. I got the margerita which was perfectly watery and cheesy like it should be. The dough is also amazing.Also got the cauliflower with chili oil. It was fine but it came out super quickly which means it was just sitting around and they heated it up for us. I wouldn't get it again.But will definitely be coming back for the pizza.

Excellent wood-fired pizza. Creative flavor combinations. Friendly servers (somewhat rare in the City). We stumbled on this place in North Beach on Labor Day weekend. The Yelp listing said "no waiting," and sure enough, we were ushered right in to the only remaining table inside. Only took about 30 seconds to understand why there were so many waiting outside -- it was a blast furnace inside. OK, we were experiencing the hottest weekend on record, and we were sitting about 10 feet from a food-fire pizza oven --- but they could have sprung for a couple of fans. First world problem aside -- the burrata was heavenly. Served with honey and a few fingers of flatbread, and a splash of greens. We followed it up with a housemate sausage/broccoli-rob pie, and a margarita pie. Excellent toppings, decent crust. The margarita had a wonderfully mild New York style red sauce. We'll be back - on a more temperate evening.

I am not big on pizza, but you haven't tried pizza till you've been here:)DRINK: Not a big selection of beer and wine, but they have really good options. Any of their red wines is a good pair with the pizzas.FOOD: Try the prosciutto pizza! It is amazing! All of their pizza is made with really fresh ingredients. You can literally taste the freshness. The Kale Caesar Salad was one of the best salads I've ever had. I would recommend trying their calamary, rice balls with cheese, and meatballs for appetizers as well.ATMOSPHERE: This restaurant is really tight and cramp, but it's honestly part of the aesthetics of the restaurant. The dim lighting at night, aroma of pizza, and loud noises causes an intimate setting. The staff are amazing at what they do.

They don't take reservations anymore, so your best bet is to arrive before 6pm. Seats at the bar = watching the pizza magic happen! During basketball season, they've got the game on (with no sound, so you can still soak up the chill Italian enoteca vibes).

Looking for Neopolitan pie, well the one I had here was a perfect duplicate of the one I had Napoli. I guess you can make our own but I suggest the "pre-designed" sections from the menu. Neapolitan and chili oil are on the bar to spice it up. Take it easy with the chili oil it's super spicy and I love heat.

My husband yelped this place....decided to go here in between times at the convention we were visiting. Greeted right away which was nice. They were friendly, personable, and seated us right away. Not too much longer, we had a server helping us. Customer service....yes, pretty good so far. We sat at the bar top, which was pretty cool because you get to see them make the pizzas, calzones, etc. Everything here is fresh and made to the order. We had the lasagna. Pretty damn good. Filling. Tasty. Delicious. We didn't get to try a lot of the food items . But a clean and nice environment, good food, beer on tap (no alcohol ), and standard city prices. I would definitely come back here....at least to try the pizza.

Hot damn, this pizza is good!Let's start by stating that I have a serious problem. On average, I eat pizza four times a week and mostly for dinner. It's an incredible habit that started long ago in New Haven, Connecticut but, I'm sure glad it started. In my book, Il Casaro is currently the reigning champ for best pizza in San Francisco. It's a perfect rendition of a classic neapolitan pizza and done with such precision that it makes my soul sing. Chewy, light crust that is perfectly burnt, San Marzano tomato sauce and beautiful mozzarella cheese make this pie unbeatable. I'll be back tomorrow. :)

It was our last night in SF. We took the Alcatraz Night Tour and when it ended, almost at 10 p.m., we were hungry. We wanted Italian so we went back to Little Italy/North Beach.Being that it was late on a Sunday night, options were few, but Il Casaro sounded like a neat spot to check out, so off we went.There was one other group in the restaurant when we arrived. Seeing NoBe on a Sunday night gave us a totally different perspective than our Saturday afternoon, very touristy visit. Now, it felt far more local.Our waiter was lovely and recommended a delightful Italian wine. We shared burrata (creamy mozzarella with bread) and olives. It was so yummy with the wine. We were right in front of the wood burning brick oven, so pizza was a must. I tried the lasagna and was not at all disappointed.It was a perfect ending to a super fun vacation in the great city of San Fran!

Get the pizza and not the pasta. There's a reason why there's tons more pizza options on their menu and only a few pasta choices. I came with a group of 6 on a Saturday night and even though the restaurant was packed we were seated within 10 minutes. Truffle Burrata- this one is a MUST! The truffle burrata is AMAZING! Comes with a little bit of arugula and cherry tomatoes on the side. Il Casaro pizza- LOVED the cremini mushrooms on this pizza. It was a perfect balance of flavor between the mushrooms, the prosciutto, and the mozzarella and grana padana cheese. The crust is perfection! Probably one of the best pizzas I've had in the city. Canneloni pasta- don't get this. The portion is kind of small and it just wasn't good. Lacked the wow factor.

Sunday, a little after lunch time, between 1-2PM. You walk into this cute cafe/restaurant where the wide windows let in plenty of sunlight. It smells amazing, like fresh baked bread and melted cheeses. It's a little warmer, but comfortable temperature especially considering SF's cold weather.My boyfriend and I sit down at a table for four near the window since there's not many other options. We're offered sparking and tap water.We split the sotto mar pizza (the one with clams and squid). We're surprised that a) the clams are still in their shells and b) there's no cheese on the pizza. We de-shell the clams and each start on a slice. DELICIOUS. We're a bit too American and feel weird that the pizza doesn't have cheese on it so we ask for some. The servers happily oblige and bring fresh grated cheese (very finely grated, like snow texture) in a small bowl to us.We sprinkle the cheese on top and continue eating our amazing pizza. Splitting one pizza between the two of us was just the right amount for us both to feel satisfied/full but not overly so.The experience was a bit dreamlike. Definitely recommend coming back! Food and ambiance were perfect for a Sunday afternoon with the boyfriend.Plus it's right by City Lights, so great to make a date of pizza + books.

This place is truly a 3-star restaurant, but I had to bump it to 4 purely for the pizza. Seriously, if you're thinking about ordering anything aside from the burrata or pizza, don't. Unless it's wine. They have a great wine list, and wine is delicious. Il Casaro is amore a prima vista. It's an intimate restaurant with windows that open onto the sidewalk for an al fresco feel. There are Italian servers and patrons filling the air with thick accents and clinks of wine glasses. The smell of the wood fired oven lingers like a sweet perfume.The first time we came for dinner in a group of 4. We ordered the arancini, burrata, the tagliatelle carbonara, and the prosciutto pizza to share family style. The burrata was really good. Sadly the carbonara was pretty bland and disappointing and felt like a waste of a dish. Our arancini came out at the same time as our pizza, and was barely warm, so I think they had forgotten about it. The pizza was outstanding and flew off the pan - it was the only thing we really liked about the meal. Service was a little slow, but it was a weekend night so it was to be expected.On our second trip, we had a group of 3 for lunch. Wiser after our first visit, we each ordered a different pizza. We tried the diavola (which was outstanding), a margherita, and the prosciutto again. The pizzas were all fantastic, with the diavola standing out as the clear favorite. The main issue with this visit was the service. There was just one server, and the poor girl looked like she might have a breakdown at any moment. Although it wasn't crazy busy, it was evident that she was scrambling between tables and trying to keep up. She took our order by writing on her hand because she had lost her paper and we went without drinks for most of our meal. I felt bad for her, but it was not a good dining experience. I think if they hired more help, it would make a huge improvement to not just the service, but getting the food out hot and fresh. Still, I'd come back anytime for their pizza. A little pricey, but absolutely worth it!

Molto bene! You don't need to wait in Tony's ridiculous line to get excellent pizza - the margherita is just as good here, and a better price. I've tried pizza and mozzarella in many areas of Italy, and Il Casaro is just as good as any. Imo this is the best pizzeria in North Beach. I had the buffalo mozzarella, margherita pizza, and prosciutto pizza. It's hard to describe the flavor; all I can say is to take my word for it and trust that it's very tasty. The food is comparable to food I've had in Italy. The pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven. Sure, many pizzerias in this area have this kind of oven, but few bake it right. Many come out doughy and/or chewy (sorry Piccolo Forno). Il Casaro is just right: thin and soft. Bottom line: if you want pizza, don't wait at Tony's (no wait to sit 12pm on Sunday, whereas Tony's had a long line). Save yourself time and go to Il Casaro. You won't be disappointed.

Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar, at 348 Columbus Ave. in San Francisco's storied North Beach, is a classic Neapolitan pizza eatery, not unlike what you might encounter on a side street in Milano. The restaurant is relatively small, and bustling, so it's best for a casual meal for up to four.Having tried the pizza on several occasions, I'm down with the 4.5 star average reviews. You'll find a highly reliable, authentic, crispy-crusted, delicately yeasty pizza with just the right amount of "bite" to the crust.If you're not certain which pie to order, the waiter will readily point you to the burrata Margherita. Enjoy a glass or two of wine while you're there, and walk off your meal with a visit to the nearby Filbert steps, all 400 of them, all the way up to Coit Tower. Don't be a weenie, start at the bottom!!

Stopped by during North Beach fest to escape the heat (which didn't actually work because like all old buildings in San Francisco, this place doesn't have air conditioning) and take a break for some lunch. We got the lasagna, the carbonara, a salad, some fried risotto balls and a mozzarella flight..... Lasagna was great, with a really rich, meaty sauce. The carbonara was impressive-- often times I feel like carbonara feels over wrought-- just too much oil or too heavy with cream or cheese, but they got this perfectly done. The risotto balls were not oily at all, and were able to retain a lot of their flavor even though they had been deep fried. The mozzarella flight I did not really partake in, but my friends assured me that it was the creamiest, silkiest mozzarella that they have had. I took off one star because our server didn't really check on us, so it was hard to put in our order or ask for more water, get drinks, etc. I also really liked this place though because it's not pretentious at all and is in the heart of North Beach! It takes a lot to stand out in a crowd, but this place definitely does it.

I was pleasantly surprised with this small pizzeria. A friend had a craving for fresh mozzarella so we decided on this restaurant. Reminiscent of small cafe / market which happens to serve pizza. The menu is expansive. You can stop in for a quick snack or enjoy a full of meal. I ordered the affettati di coppa along with castelvetrano olives to start. The antipasti plate is served with a small bed of arugula and a few slices of warm baked pizza bread. The salad was a bit salty but the remainder of the dish was delicious. Spicy coppa was amazing (perfect portion amount) and the bread was tasty. Almost made me wish we had ordered a small pizza.The mozzarella was ok. I've tasted fresher buffala but not entirely bad considering many Italian restaurants don't offer this menu option. Castelvetrano olives was fresh and perfectly brined. Overall this place is pretty solid given we were only looking for an afternoon snack. I will definitely be back!

Stumbled upon this place the old-fashioned way: I walked by while I was hungry. At just 5:30 this place was packed and the only available seats were at the bar, which was surprisingly spacious and comfortable (sit here if you enjoy watching pizza being made!). My boyfriend and I split a Diavola and it was scrumptious -- the pizza had a bit of a spicy kick and the crust was top-notch. My Italian boyfriend comes from a pizzeria-owning family and he loved this place as well. I'll definitely be back!

SHOULD BE THE #1 SPOT FOR PIZZA IN NORTH BEACH!I was randomly craving pizza on a Saturday night and decided to go a step up from delivery and frozen pizza. On top of that, I decided to head to North Beach (which is little Italy in SF).I was so hungry and determined to find good pizza that I completely forgot that it was the weekend of the North Beach Festival (which means A LOT of people and long wait times- even at 10pm)Luckily, we found this spot and were quoted about 20 mins for a table for two (this is great in comparison to the first place that we went to that told us they couldn't even guarantee anymore seating even though they didn't close for another 1.5 hours)We sat at the bar. WARNING: THERE IS AN OPEN FIRE GRILL SO IT GETS KINDA HOT, SO BEWARE!Ordered meatballs as an appetizer and prosciutto pizza with an egg on top (extra charge $) and both were delicious! Meatballs were to die for and the freshly shaven cheese on top was just the right touch! Once the egg yolk broke, it made the middle of the pizza slightly soggy but this was definitely expected (its YOLK for goodness sake!). The arugula is put on the pizza after it is cooked (they put a lot, so, if you are not a fan order something without arugula.WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK!

Nearly all the restaurants in North Beach are named after famous Italians - Marco Polo, Cristofo Columbo, Mona Lisa - so we figured that a restaurant named not after a person but a food profession was a good choice. Il Casaro a.k.a. The Cheesemaker is a reference to the mozzarella tasting bar that this restaurant is organized around. Rather than the kitschy hanging cured meats, baskets and giant wine bottles of other Italian restaurants, Il Casaro has the fresh, open feel of a modern kitchen. We sat at a small table by the open window so it felt as though we were sitting outside but were more protected from the sound, heat and debris of the busy street. My friend and I had just had a drink at Vesuvio so opted for water but they had a really interesting wine and beer list. I would love to come back sometime for a drink and a cheese appetizer. But today, we shared the Margherita pizza with prosciutto and a beet salad. The beet salad was amazing. Fresh, delicious, light and flavorful. Several kinds of beets, greens, and cheese and nut crumbles. Really nice. The pizza, however, was a bit of a disappointment. Terribly bland. Despite the prosciutto, it needed salt and I never add salt to my food at a restaurant. The crust was nothing spectacular, nice chew but too much bread, soggy in the middle and not crispy at all. I rarely eat pizza and experiences like this one remind me why. It so rarely lives up to its promise.

This is my favorite pizza place in California. It rivals the pizza I've had in Italy and I find myself craving it all the time. The Diavola and Prosciutto pizzas are the best on the menu. The tomato sauce on the pizza is addicting!!! Not too salty or sweet. I will say that the crust doesn't get as crispy as I'd like it to be, but that's the only small thing to note. One tip if you're going for a casual dinner with one friend - sit on the bar area and watch them make and crank out the pizzas! So fun!

How do I explain the magnitude of quality for this restaurant in a measly Yelp review?!You know when you go to the orchestra and there are all these instruments playing in unison and each one of them individually is beautiful but together it's a symphony! That's like the pizza here for your taste buds instead of your ears. Do you get it now?Five of us went on a Wednesday night. If you're there early enough like 6 to 8 pm I don't think there would be any issues for a table, but then later it started getting a bit busy and some folks had to wait a bit for it to clear out. I'm imagining on the weekends it's pretty packed. The pizza is phenomenal. There is no other word for it.I was starving and got to the restaurant an hour earlier than my friends. I couldn't wait, so decided to have a little appetizer. I ordered what I thought was going to be a tiny plate of meat and bread and it was a huge plate for $4.50! I got the mortadella. AWESOME. All the cured meats comes with argugala, cherry tomatoes and their delicious bread. It was such a great starter and I thoroughly enjoyed even before tasting the glorious pizza! For 5 of us, we ordered 6 pies. That's right. 6 pies which means on average every one of us ate more than a pie!? That's insane.The pizza dough is out of control. You can see on the tear how beautifully it's made. The char is a little bit on the stronger side, but not too much to over power with a smoked flavor. The sauce is absolutely perfect. Tart, but still just enough sweet. And the pizza comes out HOT with cheese falling off if you're not careful. The mozzarella is obviously ridiculously fresh. Both the regular and the burrata. Here's what we ordered:Quattro formaggio Burrata x 2Diavola (spicy salami)Margherita X 2 My favorite was the one with the salami because I love meat on my pizza, but everything else was cooked to perfection. The four cheese one is good, and I really enjoyed it but the goat cheese could be a bit intense for some people. This climbed to the list of my favorite pizza places in the U.S! Can't wait to come back again and I most definitely will.

People kissing each other on the cheek and speaking Italian is exactly what you'll find at Il Casaro.It's a modern yet cozy space which makes you forget what country you're in.Our waiter was a very cool and friendly guy that brought us wine samples when we couldn't make a decision. We went with his recommendation and I'm happy we did.Though I couldn't get past the fresh mozzarella because of how filling it was, my friend had the pizza and said it was delicious.My friend accidentally left his credit card at the restaurant, and they were kind enough to hold on to it until the next day.

Their queue doesn't work very well on busy nights. you might wait in front of the restaurant for 40 mins even though they told you before it would be a 10-15 mins wait. in the end you get a place at the bar, even though you asked for a table, while large groups have priority.

We had an excellent experience here. We came for an early dinner before a show and had arancini, salad and a bufalini pizza. All of the food was excellent, especially the cheese on the pizza. It was quick, reasonably priced, and delicious.

That sh!t was amazing!!! Such fresh, creamy, melt in your mouth mozzarella... just talking about it makes me want to turn around and order another mozzarella ball from the bar to go! The waiter and host was very welcoming for it being my first time. I sat at the bar infront of the chef and he was also very cool and struck up a quick friendly convo which wrapped up the whole experience to make it a 5 star in my book!They effortlessly made a new regular customer and will definitely recommend :)Thank you for a great ending to a hectic work day!

Disclaimer: my husband and I are both Italian expats - we moved to the Bay Area 2 years ago.We went to Casaro after hearing every Italian on our Italian expats' group on Facebook praising their pizza. I used to rarely eat pizza even when I was living in Italy, but my husband is a great lover. We went there after the movie theatre where I ate too many pop-corns so I arrived there without any hunger, therefore I decided to order a salad. Ingredients: romaine heart lettuce, roasted pine nuts, olive oil, lemon. Price: $9.5, which sounds crazy, but first, it's San Francisco and, second, maybe it was quite abundant. My husband ordered a marinara + mushrooms. It was about 1.45pm.After a wait of about 40-45 minutes, our plates arrive! In the meantime, I got really hungry and there was no bread or breadsticks to bunch on as we usually have in Italian pizzerias. But that's ok. Unfortunately, beyond a little bunch of romaine heart lettuce leaves, roasted pine nuts, olive oil and lemon, there was grated cheese all over the plate! Wonderful, I can't eat cheese. So I send them back my plate and I order calamari, that cost only 50cents more of my previous choice and are way more nutrient and satisfying. Pizza: nope. Slightly burnt at the bottom and in little dots on the perimeter, quite uncooked the rest, yielding a very soft and pillowy pizza, with zero crunchiness. It was also full of black olives - which have a strong flavor, so he removed 1/2 of them - and the mushrooms were simply cremini - in Italy, you almost never put cremini on a pizza. At the end, he said no. We won't return.

I love this place. Literally out of the over 10 times I've been to or ordered from it's been perfect. The single time time I had an issue with my food order they were not only polite but corrected it immediately! I recommend this this restaurant all day every day. I rarely review but I have to applaud this restaurants amazing food, as well as customer service. I refuse to eat pizza anywhere else in SF. P.S. everything else is amazing too.

The food here is so good! Before going to San Francisco, I did some research on Yelp for Italian food and this was 1 of 3 restaurants on my list. My friend who lives in SF recommended I try this place so I did. I arrived at the restaurant around 6pm on a week night and got a table for 2. We were seated right away because it was pretty empty (only 2 other tables filled). They don't take reservations so coming early was part of my plan. We ordered the burrata, asparagus, cauliflower, and prosciutto pizza. All of the dishes tasted amazing but I loved the burrata and the prosciutto pizza. I like that they shaved parmesan cheese over some of the dishes. It was a generous amount. For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Their tiramisu does not have a strong coffee flavor and I like it that way. The cake was moist and not too wet. It was a nice way of ending the meal.They're located across from The Stinking Rose. I actually walked on the opposite side of the street so I had to back track to find this place. The inside of the restaurant is a bit cramped and it's not the prettiest looking. Just remember that you're coming here for the food. If you don't want to stand out in the cold waiting for a table, come by 6pm and keep the party small.

So so so good. Every time I'm in San Francisco for a work layover and I'm craving pizza, there's no other choice for me. This place is the real deal. I also love that the entire staff and most of the customers around me are almost always actually speaking Italian! Delicious food, and great/friendly staff--A real gem in Little Italy. Their Diavola pizza is delicious--add arugula to it for just the perfect slice. Can't go wrong here. Buon appetito!

Wow. This pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the Fried Mozzarella and the Prosciutto pizza. We were not disappointed. We were seated immediately. The entire restaurant was booming. Seating was a little tight. The table we were placed almost felt squeezed in, but the staff is extremely nice. If you're looking for a quiet place to eat, this may not be it. But if you're looking for quality food, you've found it.

Oh a mozzarella bar. I totally get it... that makes so much sense!The fresh pulled burrata is divine. Love the rich and creamy texture of the cheese, drizzled with some olive oil, and paired with the peppery arugula salad and sweet tomatoes. So simple but so satisfying. We split a couple of pizzas including the Margherita and the Diavola. Tony's up the street probably serves a better pie but the pizzas here are pretty legit too. Nice char on the crusts and the pies hold up well to the toppings. The Diavola pie stood out a little more and I liked the savory balance between the mozzarella cheese, spicy salami, and tomato sauce.Service is really friendly and charming - some might say borderline flirty but hey, when in an Italian restaurant. Il Casaro has a decidedly younger, contemporary, and more casual vibe than its older counterparts in North Beach which should endure it to locals and tourists alike.

Authentico and deliciosa! A very harried wait staff may make you think twice, but the quick food delivery and high quality make up for this. The pizza was very well presented and tasty. The wine selections were terrific. The beet salad was among the best I've had in SF so this will now supplant our stop at North Beach and become our afternoon snack restaurant.

3.5 stars, rounding to three to bring the Yelp average back to Earth. Rather bland interior, bland customers (mostly tourists), bland, business-like service (not at all bad, just bland). Pizzas were, well, rather bland - though, I again emphasize - not bad, and fairly priced, with well made dough. Staffing is typical for the area - couple of cute chicks in the front of the house; compact Mexicans working hard in the business end. Highlight for me was the beer, 2 IPAs on tap for just $6, one the obvious Lagunitas (no arguments there, it's the only beer in my fridge), and a second excellent one I ordered and promptly forgot the name of. Overall, despite the 3/5 given, I would return.

Really yummy pizza in North Beach and probably the best I've had in SF. I can still taste the pillowy cloud of dough in my mouth. Also, it's pretty authentic from the looks of how many Italian Italians were there in the joint while I was eating. The pizzas are about $20 each and I think half is pretty filling for one meal. Service is quick, and I'd recommend sitting next to the oven at the bar. Kinda cool to see the pizzas being made.Also, order the burrata! It's heavenly...

Crust should be crust - crunchy, crispy, snappy or whatever adjective you choose. Not a hot air balloon. This is what I ended with after each slice of pizza. Was it good? Sure. It was alright. It was tasty in fact; with the addition of hot pepper flakes and Parmesan! Would I return? Highly unlikely. Shortly after being served the pizza was cold. Their Margarita pizza is floppy and soggy. The Prosciutto pizza was okay. I would have been content with just the prosciutto slices and parmesan slices to be honest. Our wine had to be served in heavy water glasses because they 'ran out of wine glasses'. Not the end of the world. But still. Plus the wine really should have had a moment to breathe for oh.. I don't know, maybe an hour or so. Our table of four was situated snugly against a wall of fire logs. Undoubtedly for use in the fire-wood pizza oven. It's a nice decor statement. Except when you're wearing a silk dress, attempting to squeeze in behind the table next to you without snagging. The salad was delicious. My favorite item on our table!

Came here with a group of 12 and they accommodated us within 10 minutes. Our group was being a bit difficult with what we would do to order, but we split the group in two and had a great time. Our side of the table (seven people) got 3 pizzas as well as the Brussels sprouts. I asked the owner what the best three pizzas were and to bring them. They were incredible. There was a spicy one, one with a ton of prosciutto, and another more simple one with mushrooms. The Brussels sprouts were tasty and our group (of seven) had a great time!

WOW! Doesn't matter how full you are, it's so hard to stop eating the pizza here. The dough is incredible, heavenly, light, and slightly charred from the oven. It's perfect. The cheese is imported and fantastic. The ratio of cheese, sauce, and dough was perfect. There wasn't a single thing wrong with this meal. Five of us first ordered 4 pizzas and inhaled them instantly. Then we all decided to order two more, which I was a little skeptical that we'd finish but of course those were gone in a second too. One of the best meals I've ever had in SF! Service was also great - our waiter was fast and very efficient. Price was also very reasonable. Good pizza is hard to find in SF and this place is at the top of our list now.

This place gets it right. Napoli pizza is not meant to be fancy, it's street food. The focus is in the quality of ingredients and the technique in its creation. Il Casaro is the most authentic Neapolitan pizza joint in San Francisco. Super friendly service and pizza that is out of this world. Know that this style is different. Don't go in looking for your local pizza joint. One person could eat one pizza. But the flavor is incredible.I love sitting at the bar and watching them work. Highly recommended if looking for great food in San Francisco!

This has to be some of the best pizza I've had! Classic Neapolitan Pizza done with great care. So glad I made it here during my long weekend in SF. Let me tell you why Il Casaro was such a great experience... For one thing, their wait for a party of 6 was reasonable - about 30minites. We were originally going to go to Tony's, but after we were quoted a 2.5hr wait time we decided to go somewhere else. I had seen good reviews on Yelp for Il Casaro so we made our way over. Upon arrival we put our name on the list. Only 2 parties ahead of us! Score! Finally after about 30mins of waiting we were seated. Il Casaro is small... I think the biggest table I saw seated 6 and it was the one we had. I love small restaurants though, so much more intimate. When you walk in you see the huge pizza oven right in the center with the pizza makers right there tossing the dough. So cool to watch them work their magic. Once seated we ordered wine and beer - very reasonably priced. Next up we got the burrata appetizer. If you have never had burrata you are seriously missing out. It is amazingly creamy mozzarella! It was served with flatbread, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. So fresh and a great beginning to what was to come. Or party of 6 ordered 3 pizzas: the prosciutto, the buffala, and the broccoli rabe. My favorite, hands down was the prosciutto! YUM!! So much prosciutto, delicious cheese, and a fabulous chewy crust. The buffala was a close second. Our whole party agreed though that the broccoli rabe & sausage pizza was a kiss. The flavors didn't mesh well. I'd skip this one if I were you. The broccoli rabe was too bitter, in my opinion. Overall this was an exceptional pizza experience in Little Italy. Check this superb place out when you are in SF.

Hands down, some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. They have authentic Roman-style wood-fired brick oven pizza. Their fresh buffalo mozzarella is very high quality, and shouldn't be missed.

We dined here last weekend after Benjamin F. and I had a lengthy discussion about the best pizza in the city, and this place doesn't disappoint. We made a last minute reservation for 9:30pm and were happily surprised when we arrived at 9:00 and were seated almost immediately, even though they were running a wait. We enjoyed the Diavola pizza and lasagna - both were very tasty. The crust definitely had some intentional char, a little too much for my taste but still the perfect chewy texture I look for in a Neapolitan pizza. My favorite pizza still belongs to Spin in Kansas City, but since I won't be getting pizza from there too often, this will be a great stand in. There's a fun create your own ice cream sandwich shop across the street if you want a sweet ending to your meal!

The food here is DELICIOUS and the service is excellent. My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday, and Il Casaro was more than worth our time and money. The Insalata Romana is such a simple but tasty dish, with perfectly toasted pine nuts and the right balance of lemon, olive oil and pepper. We shared a slice of the lasagna, which offered a delicious blend of tomatoes, spices and meat. Our final main dish was the Calabrese pizza - very yummy, except the sausage was a little too spicy for me. To cool my mouth, I ended the meal with their soft serve ice cream topped with caramel sauce. I loved every bite. I highly recommend this restaurant.

The pizza here is INCREDIBLE. They put that wood fire oven to good use for sure and the fresh mozzarella was a tasty touch. I also got meatballs which were both substantial and delicious.Another cool thing is if you sit in the bar area you get a nice view of the chefs expertly rolling and kneading the dough for crusts and working the fire oven. It's quite appetizing as well as puts you in the mood for Italian food.I really wanted to give this five stars, but for one thing that was bugging me the whole time. The stark and glaring juxtaposition of the hardcore rap/hip hop music blaring overhead. Because nothing says authentic Italian food like the soothing croon of Rihanna and Drake. Also, there aren't many seats so you'll be in for a long wait during peak hours.Other than that. The food is Italian perfection.

This lil gem is located in the Russian Hill area & there are many Italian places around there as well. I'm so glad I chose this place! And it was a short walk from my hotel.There was a crowd of people outside waiting to be seated, but because I was dining alone, I was seated right away at the bar. Absolutely appreciate that. I could see how the pizzeros, or pizza makers, made the delicious pizzas.I ordered the margherita pizza & it was so incredibly delicious, I ate the whole thing too! (Don't judge, I was carb loading for a 5K!) They brought carafes/bottles of water to the guests & small glasses to pour into.I also ordered a Mexican coke. Everything was very good. The service was attentive, the atmosphere was casual & lively. Really, everything a good dinner experience should be. The price was reasonable as well. I'll be back. I'm sure.
