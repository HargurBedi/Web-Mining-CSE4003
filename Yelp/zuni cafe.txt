Zuni Cafe's one of those places you hear about everywhere, mainly for their roast chicken, but I could never justify dropping $60 for chicken, and so I never went. However my curiosity continued to build and build, and finally I decided to come for dinner. We made reservations about a week in advance, and the only time slot they had available was 5:30 for a Friday afternoon. We arrived and were seated promptly at 5:30, only to find out that their dinner menu doesn't start until 6. Until then, the menu is limited to a couple of small bites (including a good selection of oysters) and cocktails. Who knew?We both ordered a cherry collins ($13.50) to tide us over until we could order real food at 6. It contained New Deal gin, Cherry Heering, lemon, and club soda, and was a good drink to slowly sip away at over conversation.The moment it hit 6, we immediately ordered the chicken ($58) as we knew it would take almost an hour. We were probably the first table to place in our order! I'm really glad we did though, as the chicken took the expected hour to be served. Did the roast chicken live up to expectations? Surprisingly...yes. The chicken is mostly deboned and served in small pieces so that it is easier to eat, though I still found myself eating with my hands as it was hard to eat all the meat off the bones with only a fork and knife. It's served with a huge mount of mustard greens on top and a warm vinegar-y bread salad on the bottom that was delicious, especially when eaten together with the chicken.The thighs and drumstucks were tender and moist, but what surprised me was how moist the chicken breast was! Honestly, it was probably the best chicken breast I've ever had, way better than my attempts to sous vide chicken breast at home. Not only was the skin perfectly flavored, but to my surprise so was the meat inside. Oftentimes the salt doesn't penetrate very deep into the skin and you're left with bland meat, but that wasn't the case here. And the skin, which is my favorite part of a chicken, was roasted to a perfect crisp. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken, and while we were not able to finish the whole chicken by ourselves, I took a couple pieces home and they were still just as delicious a couple days later (though unfortunately the skin was no longer crispy).While I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around $58 roast chicken (which is really closer to $80 once you add tax, tip, and the 5% SF health mandate...), I can definitely see the appeal and might be willing to come back and splurge again at some point in the future.Service was great, as you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre.

All my little foodie heart wanted was roasted chicken. I came to Zuni with a plan:Skip my 4pm snack (which, btw was SO hard to do)Leave work at 5Friend shows up at 5 and places an order for chickenArrive around 5:30Kill thirty minutes of time with a plate of shoestring potatoes on repeat while excitedly awaiting chicken (which totally hits the spot)Conquer the whole chicken by myselfExcept, we shared the chicken but I ate most of it since he wasn't super hungry anyways (I blame the bench press PR for my outrageous hunger that day).It was kind of the best that my friend was visiting and wanted to grab an early dinner. I've heard so much about the roasted chicken with Tuscan style bread salad, this was the perfect opportunity to try it. The chicken actually does take an hour to roast so either don't show up super hungry or pace yourself with some appetizers. I know, I know. It's "just chicken". BUT, it's delicious. It's perfectly moist, skin is deliciously crispy, and although it has minimal seasoning it's executed so well! Friend mentioned between eating other things and coming back to the chicken, if you eat a small, small bite you'll savor it and realize actually how delicious it is (instead of hogging it like I did). It's really clean tasting and no frills. Simplicity at its best. The salad though, I felt that needed to be salt and peppered and I wasn't a huge fan of the balsamic-vinegar dressing. I enjoyed the pine nuts, yum. Meh. You won't get a whole salad though, just a few frilly mustard greens. We also ordered the little gem salad which is a few pieces of butter lettuce, a couple radishes and carrots. I liked the tangy buttermilk dressing. For dessert we opted for two desserts: the pot de creme and something similar to a galette with seasonal fruit. That chicken though, I almost ordered a second one.

I was surprised to learn that Zuni has been around longer than I've been alive, because the entire experience feels fresh and updated with the times. It's wedged in an area of town that's not quite Hayes Valley but not quite Civic Center either, and it offers California cuisine in sophisticated, but approachable surroundings. The triangular corner venue is particularly pleasant at lunch, as large windows let in lots of natural light into the airy space, which makes full use of both the ground level as well as a loft-like space. A side dish of polenta was indeed a fresh, sunny way to start the meal. Combined with a savory, well-prepared burger featuring organic, grass-fed beef from Marin, it was quite a satisfying, filling lunch.Service was as sophisticated as the setting, and the drink selection was quite decent too. Prices were also reasonable given the quality of the ingredients, preparation, and entire experience. Whether you're a local or a visitor, if you're looking for a restaurant that exemplifies Bay Area dining, then Zuni would be a good candidate.

A classic SF institution, Zuni Cafe's classic dining room looks like it's from decades ago, but they're mixing in fresh Californian ingredients and flavors into their menu, which changes nightly. However, there are certain classic items that have been on the list for decades--Zuni, of course, is famous for their chicken, which takes a whole hour to make, and this is indeed what most tables around me ordered. Having heard all the hype, I had to try this dish (and a host of others) for myself! Coming in for dinner on a Sunday, we were seated with our reservation, and our kind waiter walked us through his recommendations on the menu.After starting with Acme bread, we had the Caesar salad, which was a fairly generous portion of romaine lettuce dressed with Casesar dressing, parmesan, and fresh croutons! This was a really refreshing, umami dish, and made for a great start to the meal. Then we had two additional small plates--the piccolo fritto was a plate of deep-fried romanesco, onions, and lemons, served with a charred onion crema. I found it slightly disappointing--it seemed to be a random amalgamation of deep-fried vegetables without any good balance or surprising flavors. The ricotta gnocchi served with lobster mushrooms, corn, and chives were light, ethereal, and creamy, but they lacked a certain heartiness and umami flavor that come with a good gnocchi dish.And then the chicken! It was indeed perfectly brined and roasted--juicy on the inside and crispy skin on the outside. The chicken is cooked over Acme bread, which absorbs all of the juices, and the bread becomes part of the bread salad, alongside pine nuts and currants, and the whole dish is topped with frilly mustard greens. This was good chicken indeed and executed perfectly, but for me, it was still just chicken and a little hard to justify the $58 price tag. Finally came dessert--we split the blackberry panna cotta, which was nice and light and not overly sweet. It was served with nectarines and ginger snap cookies on the side--a nice seasonal dish to round off the meal! Overall, Zuni has a great atmosphere and some of the dishes are decent--however, I didn't find the food particularly creative or any of the flavors particularly surprising. Their chicken is definitely good, but the overall prices and value could have been better.

This might be one of the best burgers I've ever had! Absolutely delicious and so juicy. I don't know how they do it! We even asked what they put into their burgers and our water told us it was just ground beef with salt and pepper. I'm still in awe.We also ordered the shoestring potatoes, which are basically super finely cut fries. Pretty good, nothing too noteworthy to share. It came with mustard and ketchup; mustard was good. We also ordered polenta, which was creamy and delicious.Our waiter was friendly and gave a good wine recommendation. They don't have the most extensive wine menu for single glasses. Although if you're looking to buy a bottle, there's a page long list for reds and another page long list for whites!The only reason why this experience wasn't 5 stars was because of the extremely long wait for our burger. The wait was nearly an hour long, during a not so busy hour. We were seated at around 2:30 in the afternoon. Also I do want to mention that we came without a reservation at 2:30 and didn't have to wait for a table at all!

Everyone said the chicken here is bomb but you don't really know why a simple oven baked chicken can be bomb unless you tried. A $60 dollar baked chicken- I wasn't sure I'd get it anywhere else, but since everyone said it's the thing here, I tried it- and Ioved it. We made reservation here at 10:30 and was seated promptly. Unlike other brunch places, this actually takes reservation( which I love love) considering how restaurants get so crowded in the weekend. The restaurant is also located kinda in Hayes valley area- which is great for a brunch walk after getting so much food. There was a farmers market thing going on after we got brunch, and it was definitely nice to be out of FIDI and enjoy a more communal, chill vibe. We ordered oysters and the chicken. Make sure you put it on the order as soon as you get there- it takes 60 minutes to make. But was it worth it- yes! It was so tender and soft the meat feels like it just melts in your mouth. Although it's salted but the flavors are still just right you don't feel an overwhelming amount of saltiness in the mouth- just enjoy the juiciness of the chicken! I think the main selling point of this dish is the juiciness. The chicken can be shared by two but I think an additional appetizer would be good to counter the meat. The Caesar salad here is also good. The price came out to be 110 for two easily. Oh next time I'd try the margaritas- I heard it's amazing. Even if you don't like margaritas.

Maybe it's because of the hype, but I thought Zuni was just okay. Definitely good vibes, cool space, and convenient location from BART, but the food was only slightly above average and everything is really pricey. I was, however, able to make reservations about a week in advance, which is a plus!I had a cocktail that was called Ginger...Something...because it sounded so refreshing. It was overly sweet and not the refreshing cocktail I was looking for. We ordered two appetizers, the tomatoes and fried vegetables. The tomatoes were really good, but the fried vegetables felt so elementary and there wasn't nothing special about them. They tasted like not-as-good-tempura. For entrees, everything was like $30-40. We should've ordered the chicken, but instead decided to order a bunch of smaller plates. We got the arugula salad, caesar salad, bowl of polenta, squid, and gnocchi. I think the best thing we ordered was the gnocchi...but it was only like 10 pieces. I guess given it was half the price of the entrees ($18), I should've known...but also $18 pasta at any other restaurant is usually a pretty sizable dish! Maybe I'll be back...maybe I won't...but either way, I wasn't wowed by my first experience, and there are a bazillion other places to try in the Bay Area!

I've been meaning to write this updated review for some time. You are never rushed out of here, the ambiance is just what you need for comfort. My last two lunch dates here have been superb. Zuni makes you feel at home. The last time we lunched, both of ordered the rabbit. The dish was sooooo delicious. A SF classic.

We heard firsthand from people we know, received recommendations from top waitstaff in the city and read reviews online that the "Chicken for Two" is a must do at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco. We had to try it on an anniversary weekend.I give the "Chicken for Two" a healthy thumbs up, yet I give Zuni Cafe a romantic thumbs down.I usually love a local establishment, with a little history and a niche item on the menu. We were going for the nostalgia.We had a late afternoon reservation and asked for a quiet, corner table near a window. The restaurant met our request on everything but quiet. We were seated next to a large and noisy group that had downed a few bottles of wine prior to our arrival. It was likely fun for them but not for us.We asked to be moved and it seemed our only option for peace and comfort was the outside patio. It was a pleasant day by the bay, our order was on the rotisserie and we waited patiently as staff checked in. Once we settled in and our food arrived, we were happy. The chicken for two was not mind blowing but it was sweet. Maybe, the premise here is that nostalgia and a good dish alone deserves four stars. Happy Anniversary wherever we go!#ZuniCafe#ChickenforTwo#NostalgiaWins

So I was in town and my friend who lives in the Bay Area had always wanted to go here. I'm so glad she picked this place. This was truly a gem to go to. Definitely not your typical brunch place. While they had items like French toast most of the items are things you don't typically think to find for brunch. We ordered the Pizza with Wagon Wheel cheese with cauliflower which was amazing and had orange zest on top which was a fantastic addition. We had the pasta of the day which had a bolognese like sauce and this was delicious. For dessert we had the panna cotta which was out of this world. The bread that they give you was so fresh. My friend had the cafe latte which came in a large bowl cup that she enjoyed. I love the fact the menu changes so next time I'm in town I'd love to go back and try new items! Until next time...PS since I was heading out of town I had my suitcase with me and we ate upstairs so the waiter was nice enough that at the end asked if I needed help going down the stairs so he carried my bag down for me. Love considerate waiters!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and got seated right away. We were actually walking to Hayes Valley from the our home in the Mission and decided to stop in when we saw it wasn't too busy. I was pretty jet-lagged from a trip abroad, so the afternoon meal was perfect.We couldn't resist ourselves from getting the chicken for two, which is the unmatched, perfect meal for two. Sometimes you have to choose between crispy skin and tender chicken, but in true San Francisco fashion, you can have it all. This is a place to stay. And in our world where there is demand to get in and out and on with your day, I appreciate Zuni Cafe's intention of the late lunch lounge.

When I think of a classic SF restaurant, I think of Zuni Cafe. The chicken here is a must and my friends who used to live nearby and moved to Chicago always tell me how much they miss the Zuni chicken. The food is solid and you seriously can't go wrong dining here with friends. The layout is a little interesting in the upstairs area and there's this one area where you're squished with two other tables in a small box... so it gets really loud and echo-y from all the chatter.

Came for a 10pm dinner, straight from SFO. I flew in from JFK, which meant I was still on Eastern time, meaning it was really like a 1am dinner. My body was ready.Located right off Market, the nice interior of the restaurant more than makes up for the outside, which tends to smell like feces. Woof. Not the fault of the restaurant at all, but let's just say it's good that they keep the door closed. My friends were very adamant that the 60-minute chicken was the thing to get here, so we ordered that, as well as the shoestring fries, the deep-fried quail, and the brick-oven trout. The shoestring fries were okay, although I personally like fries that have slightly more potato in them. The deep-fried quail was excellent, and the pomegranate actually cut through the richness quite nicely. The brick-oven trout was delicious, although it took me a while to get through all the bones. As for the chicken, it was everything that I hoped for, and the schmaltzy croutons were unbelievably good. The chicken was roasted nicely and quite moist throughout the chicken, even in the white meat.The service in general was great, although the host made the really odd suggestion of keeping my luggage underneath the piano. I politely declined, trying to hide my puzzled look. Prices are a little expensive for chicken, but it is some darn good chicken, so it's worth a try.Definitely a solid choice for dinner, especially for group dinners and perhaps even for a date. Will definitely be back for that chicken, and to see what other seasonal offerings will be available.

I guess it was A-OK? I mean from the rave reviews as this being known as an iconic SF spot, I gotta say: not super impressed. It's a nice central location and the space is really nice, but we found the drinks to be adequate, the food and service alright and everything super pricey. Without a reservation (and good luck making one), the wait was a little over an hour and a half on a Saturday night when we arrive at about 6:45.The husband's margarita wasn't awesome at $12. So limey, he winced with every sip. That was on the cocktail list and one shouldn't be wincing when drinking a house cocktail.We ended up ordering fries (SO GOOD), clams, extra bread, the chicken for two, caesars salads (all over dressed), the pasta and the pork chop and our table of four all agreed: the fries and the pork chop were tops, everything else was unmemorable. Pair that with 2 bottles of wine and we dropped close to $500 with tip. That's a crap-load of money.The bread isn't served warm, which is sad. Actually, now that I mention, most of the food isn't served warm. The pasta was room temp, the pork chop was good, but the accompanied mashed potatoes were cold and sent back. The chicken for two took well over an hour (it does say an hour on the menu, but our was closer to an hour and a half). It actually even arrived about 15 minutes after our dining companions' food with no apology. It's a ton of food, but at the end of the day, it was an oven cooked chicken topped with frisee and croutons. Simple. Honestly, it was good, the chicken was juicy, but it was again served room temp, and not knock your socks off for such an expensive meal. My friend's room temp pasta wasn't finished, she didn't care for it. The desserts were ok. The service was fine. None of us were that impressed with anything. We came, we saw, we ate, we left. I wouldn't return and probably wouldn't recommend to anyone. There's better out there, but I checked it out to see what the fuss was about.

This is hands down my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything is always the best possible version of itself. The casual fine dining vibe is great, and the service is always on point. Their drinks are also fantastic. I like to start with a lillet and end with some calvados. The food: If it's your first time at Zuni, you will want to order the chicken. It is the best chicken you will ever eat. It takes an hour, so you'll want to tell the waiter as soon as you are seated. The Caesar salad is one of the best caesars you'll ever get. The dressing is deliciously garlicky without being overpowering. Everything at Zuni has perfect balance. I love the shoe string fries so I always get them. The brisket is delicious and should be tried. It melts in your mouth and it is paired with some sides that really compliment the flavors. The burger is the best burger I've had. It's simply perfect. What makes the burger great is that it isn't reinventing the wheel or trying to be more than it is. The beef patty is so flavorful and cooked to perfection. I also really enjoy the pickled veggies that it is served with. Something to note about the burger is that it is not always on the menu. It is on for lunch/brunch and then makes an appearance after 9pm. The pizza is also on point in it's simplicity. It isn't loaded with toppings so you can really enjoy the main ingredients: cheese, tomato sauce and bread. Can you tell I love this place?

Wonderful little place, with amazing menu. I got the Irish tea off of their cocktail menu and it was great. Then for my starter the wild arugula salad with beats and pistachios were out of this world. You must also order their famous shoestring potatoes, it's a large portion, so ask for a half order if you think you can't eat all. Finally for my main, I ordered the top sirloin steak which comes medium rare but I ordered it medium well. Every item in the menu was well though out and well made. Will definitely be back.

One of my all time favorite places to dine in the Civic Center area, though usually for special occasions since it isn't easy on the pocketbook. Ate here with friends last in March, had the arugula salad (with Manchego cheese, paprika almond, citrus vinaigrette), Zuni Caesar salad, Llano Seco Ranch porchetta (seasoned with rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, Tuscan kale, black trumpet mushroom, buckwheat polenta, ricotta salata), and roasted chicken (in wood fired brick oven with rugosa squash, wild rice pilaf, miners lettuce, maple vinegar sauce). All so delicious!

I went here during brunch time with my family. We ordered their famous roasted chicken before we took a look at the menu since the chicken took ~45 min to make. The waiter told us the chicken was pretty big so in order to avoid too much, we ordered a side French fries and Cesar salad to compliment the chicken dish. The french fries was pretty mediocre. I liked the Cesar salad--the lettuce was crispy and the dressing was not overly heavy. The chicken came faster than we expected but it was not as amazing as we thought would be. The meat was pretty dry and oily and the whole dish was kinda bland. I think our overall experience was pretty MEH. I am not sure if I will come back again.

Zuni Cafe is a San Francisco classic and a great place for dinner any night of the week.The ambiance is fabulous, with nice views of market street and a quaint feeling on the interior. I came here for dinner with a friend and it was the first time either of us had dined here. I ordered the caesar salad (one of Zuni Cafe's specialities) and the porchetta plate which comes with kale, mushrooms, and a buckwheat polenta. It was a really fantastic meal. My friend ordered the lamb mixed grill, which comes with hummus, carrots, and sesame seeds. We finished the night with a pot of tea (I had the mint and he had the green tea). I was impressed with the attentiveness of the staff, and the timeliness of the service. Overall, it was a great experience.

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Our reservation was originally for 9:45 but we got there early (8:30) and they were able to get us seated by 9pm! *this usually works at most restaurants because there are last minute cancellations all the timeFirst off, the food was impeccable. Every dish, every morsel I had was better than the last. I came in to the evening telling myself to be "healthy" and order only 1 entree. Calamari, salad, entree, two desserts in, I definitely did not do that. Apparently the menu changes every service, but perhaps there are some things that always stay on the menu. The guy at the table next to us ordered a burger, which I did not see on the menu.Appetizer: Calamari - this was good, a little too breaded for my liking, but good nonetheless. The sauce for the calamari was haphazardly thrown on to the side of the plate (normally it's in a separate small bowl), and there wasn't enough sauce because of it. Avocado and beets salad - very delicious and refreshing! So glad I chose this. The citrus vinaigrette perfectly balanced the avocado and beets.Main: Sea Bass with Zucchini and Hazelnut - very good, ingredients complimented one another and was very, very filling!Dessert:Fig Cobbler (of some sort)- this was my favorite dessert. A delicious creme was poured over it, and the pats and peaches and other fruits went so well with the fig.Chocolate mousse - delicious.

Ding 1 star for no brunch on Saturday and only on Sundays :/My friend and I decided to give it a shot here for lunch since we were starving. We were surprised to see the hamburger's price but it was definitely delicious and cooked perfectly. Medium rare was the way to go. Unfortunately, it was also pretty small and I expected some big *** burger given the price. Perhaps I'll have to come back to try the brunch.

Came here with a friend who used to eat here regularly 15+ years ago. Friend noted that we would order the 'Chicken for 2'. While waiting we had some great cocktails (vodka infused red pepper vodka martini) and then had a really great meal. Should be 'Chicken for 4' since we had enough leftover chicken to eat for lunch the next two days.

The service is still good, but the food has passed its prime. The once amazing burger is now a dry choke-hazard, and the salads are simply forgettable. I can't even remember which we ordered. If you think big = better, the shoestring fries will impress your eyes, just don't eat them. Ugh. Over. After all of these years, and dozens of visits, we won't be back.Also, beware of the mandatory 5% fee that they add on to all checks without explanation. Shady, shady, shady. If you are making your patrons pay your employees a living wage, then you shouldn't sneak it into the bill AFTER you have our credit card, and then have the nerve to ask us to TIP on top of the fees?!!!! ELIMINATE TIPPING altogether and adjust your prices accordingly. It's time to end this archaic system that forces good servers to BEG FOR TIPS and good customers to tip poor servers out of guilt. Just PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES A LIVING WAGE already. Period.

This is a great restaurant to try out! The menu changes frequently which keeps things fresh and exciting. The caesar salad was great, it was simple yet delicious. The chicken for two is a must try and definitely worth the wait (typically takes one hour to make). The meat was very soft and juicy and the skin was gently crisp. For dessert I recommend the flourless chocolate cake, another thing the restaurant is known for other than their chicken. It's not thick and fudgy like other flourless cakes, instead it's light and fluffy!Pro Tip: You can order the chicken right away when you seat so shave off some time. I was told that you could arrive early and place the order. That is NOT the case. You can only place an order when you are seated.

Disappointed with my experience here--I had high expectations, especially with everyone extolling the virtues of the chicken! I chose this restaurant as my final SF restaurant to try before moving out of the Bay Area.My sister and I ate lunch here and were seated on the 2nd floor. The ambience was great, since it was a sunny day. Service, though sparing due to high traffic, was nice as well. We ordered the chicken for two and sat out the hour-long wait with a plate of shoestring fries ($6), which were definitely more than enough to keep us satisfied while we chatted. Unfortunately, though, when the chicken came, we were surprised by how mundane it was. For $58, I expected a dish that would knock my socks off, and I was instead left confused about the place and the ratings. I was really excited to try this place and its signature dish, but perhaps I should have tried something else.tl;dr - Unpopular opinion that the chicken is not worth the price and is quite ordinary.

Had a brunch reservation before a matinee at the Orpheum. It's a leisurely 15-20min stroll, perfect for the rare sunny day.We arrived early and there was already a line of people waiting for opening, a testament to how great the food is. We were seated in the back, next to a firewood stove with an amusing view of people walking down Market, all dressed (or not :P) from Bay to Breakers.Their sourdough bread is absolutely amazing. My parents had never tried polenta before so we shared one as a starter - they gave us each a plate and spoon. It's a good size for four people to taste and was very rich and creamy.Each entree came with a vibrant arrangement of beautiful veggies. I had the grilled sea bass, super juicy with a fresh hit of lemon juice. We also had the pork sausage, tostada with pork, and skirt steak, everything was delicious.My dad couldn't stop raving about how rich and fragrant their coffee is. The service was excellent, you can tell they take real pride in the food. We'll definitely be back to try the chicken.

We are glad we experienced this restaurant. However, The menu is so limited. We enjoyed the food but felt it was too pricey for what it was. A roasted chicken for two (seemed like a whole chicken and was comparable to a Costco roasted chicken at $5.99) should Not cost $60 and for it to take 1 hour is just silly. Restaurant is nice and quaint but tables are very close to each other. We liked our server a lot but it was challenging to have our water glasses filled. ...Always a measure of good service. Also they forgot our tea with dessert. Glad we tried it but no desire to return.

On my way home from work the other day I stopped by Zuni Cafe for a little R&R and anchovies. The main restaurant wasn't open yet because I was in between services but, the bar was open and I happily took a seat. I've dined at Zuni once before and experienced the amazing whole chicken, so I figured I'd see what the bar was all about. I was on bike so ordered pretty light (see picture) and had a glass of white wine. The anchovies were ok, nothing special. I would have figured that with a place with such high expectations and great food, that their canned fish would have matched. Oh well. The cheese and olives were just fine too, nothing special. I suppose it's tough to review a place just based on one starter so, I'm taking into account my prior visit which was definitely a 5 star experience. This time around, probably closer to 3. Moral of this story...come to Zuni for dinner and you'll have a great experience. Not a great spot for a quick in/out app and drink. Either way, mad respect to place that's been in business so long because it really is a great spot!

I had not been to Zuni for several years, but some friends suggested that we go there for brunch before attending an concert at the SF Jazz Center (which is just a few blocks away).The ambiance was elegant and inviting, the service was friendly and attentive, and the food I had (French toast with bourbon syrup) was good, and reasonably priced for a restaurant of this type.

I've been here a handful of times and always get the roasted chicken. It's the goddamn best, and that bread salad it comes with is amazing too.Their shoestring fries and Caesar salads are also great, as are their desserts and cocktails.The staff here is also good. Not for eating, I mean. They're attentive and accommodating.

Oh how I love Zuni. I love the gorgeous, light filled building. I love that it is both casual and elevated at the same time. It makes me feel a little bit fancy, but in an understated way. First thing you do: order the chicken with bread salad. It takes an hour. If you are going to the theatre, call ahead and order the chicken. My husband and I went recently and didn't have time for the chicken and while everything we had was lovely, the chicken is a show stopper. It is also a very hearty meal and I would call it generous to say it just for two people. I recommend ordering it for four so that you can taste other things while you wait. Ok, so the chicken order has been placed. Next, get a chilled glass of rose, oysters and the shoestring fries. Enjoy conversation with your friends and soak in the atmosphere. IF you go rogue and decide against the chicken [god help you], know that all other portions are on the daintier side. My husband and I went recently and ordered oysters, the Caesar salad, a pasta and a fish dish and were sad that we didn't have time to get dessert. We were going to see Hamilton so don't feel sorry for us, but we could have been more full. We sadly opted for peanut M&Ms at the theatre. Don't judge.

Nice space, good food, but not that good. We came here because of their famous chicken. I'm Portuguese so I'm pretty spoiled when comes to food and chicken. So I would say the chicken is pretty good but not $54 good or even 1h wait good. Yes, you will always need to wait 1 hour to get your chicken because of the way they cook it. Apart from the chicken there was honestly nothing that seemed that special or yummy in this place. Yes they have oysters. It also all super expensive. Wine... Expensive too. In summary, a forgettable place in my humble opinion. Go to a Peruvian rotisserie and you'll enjoy prob even more their chicken... For a portion of the price.

The place has a stand up bar and only things I've tried are the drinks and some appetizers including their famous thin french fries. The menu unfortunately is too "chi chi" meaning I'm not into these high end types of meals and want more down home foods. Maybe I'll revisit again in the future to see if anything jumps out at me on the menu.

Lovey happening ambiance on a Wednesday evening on the first floor. Great service. Attentive but not hovering. The bread is good (but not nearly as good as Josey Baker Bread or Frances or Tartine). What is great is the chicken and bread--so simple but the ingredients really do shine. I am usually a bit wary of simple food (Chez Panisse is a bit minimalist for me) but this was truly excellent. A good portion but not too heavy. The bread salad really is special. You know his is a star dish if Ottolenghi raved about it and tried to replicate it!While we waited, we had the anchovies which were nice and different but wouldn't get again because a small portion and a bit on the simple side--but overall good. The Caesar salad was worth getting as it's a dressing that really coated the leaves wonderfully and the combination was more than the sum of its parts. We didn't have room for dessert as the two us already had some chicken to take home.Overall, a great place for an evening out.

We were excited to try brunch here because we've heard such good things. Got there around 12:30p on a Sunday. We were immediately sat which was nice. Food was tasty. But service was ridiculously slow and the food took forever. They never cleared our table when people were done with their plates. Given the prices, we'll probably go elsewhere for brunch.

Best Roast Chicken ever in my life!!!It is served over bread salad, which is basically chopped up bread (cubes) drizzled with olive oil and dressing and chicken juice, so delicious!!!!Even though it was the BEST chicken ever, its OVER PRICED!!!! Come on $60? It's chicken guys, you didn't raise them or anything liek that.Ordered a few appetizers, all were okay but the star is that chicken. Ordered one to share between three ladies. Will definitely return when I'm a millionaire.

ZUNI is the perfect local San Francisco cafe' with world class cuisine. We had an early dinner of oysters and their Famous brick oven roasted chicken for two. Our oysters were an assortment of 20 favorites with the most perfectly dressed Ceasar salad I have ever had. Then came the roasted chicken, oh-my-gawd ...... is all we could say, it was a consensus of four adults that this whole roasted chicken was the finest any of us had the privilege of tasting......ever. That is quite a statement but not too surprising seen as this is a winner of the prestigious James Beard Award. Coffee and desert was amazing as well as TOP NOTCH service from the fine staff of professionals. This place is not to be missed. Thank you Thank you Thank you !

I mean... It's good food. Don't get me wrong. But the hype does not live up to the reality.We ordered the anchovies, chicken, and the panna cotta dessert. First of all, is it impossible to roast a chicken in under 70 minutes? It is if you want a dry chicken. With no sauce. I have had better chicken elsewhere. Like, Limon for instance. And the panna cotta was supposed to have Myer lemon, but I could barely taste any lemon at all.The saving grace for this meal was the anchovies. Some interesting and daring paring going on... And who would have thought celery could taste so good? But if you don't want to get charged $3 for the tonic in your gin and tonic (it was well gin, too) you can find plenty of other dining options who just do this whole "food and beverage" thing better.

Terrible service. Chicken was undercooked. Instead of issuing me a refund for the $55 dollar chicken I didn't eat the waiter comes back and says how about we take 50 percent off the entre. Who the fuck does that ? They undercooked the entre I didn't eat it and they insisted I still pay 50 percent off it.

I really really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't deal with the pretentious vibe. We put our names at the front and we were told to wait and look for our own table. It got sooo awkward when the staff told us, and others, "first come first serve". We found ourselves fighting for any open table. Once seated, I saw what looked like a cook use the restroom with his apron on. Upon exiting, he wiped his hands off on the apron and continued to work. I really hope he washed his hands. Servers were really nice though. We decided to only order a drink, an appetizer, and eat else where.

Cocktails were excellent. Caesar had amazing croutons and good dressing. The most amazing dish was the chicken for two and the shoestring potatoes. Not sure if we waited a whole hour, because the cocktails were flowing, but definitely worth the wait. The portion was huge and the "bread salad," which we discovered underneath about 1/4 of the way in was like nothing we've ever had before. Scrumptious. BTW, we didn't have a reservation, but were immediately seated at a table at the bar. (9 pm on a Wednesday)

Yum! This place totally lives up to its name in culinary food! Everything on the menu is really good so I recommend you come with a foodie partner and crime so you guys can split all the yummy meals. Their chicken is what they're known for but it takes about an hour to cook - and yes it's worth the wait. I recommend you try their desserts too because they're all very tasty :)

Best chicken in my entire life!!!!! I have never, to my recollection, raved about chicken, until now. This place had the most naturally flavorful, juiciest yet perfectly cooked, with the most succulent skin to surround it, chicken that my wife or I have ever had, period! The bread salad and greens were perfect with it and left us breath taken:)Amazing selection of and absolutely the freshest and most perfect pure range of six different pacific oysters. I had them sans anything and was so glad I did!!!Sancerre recommended by our excellent waiter was perfect with our oysters and ceased salad starter (oh and who would have thought they there could have been an amazing interpretation of ceaser salad that leaves you raving about it as a unique starter as well. Unbelievable - deserts didn't disappoint - panna cotta was incredible!

The atmosphere was very nice and the service was great. I just wasn't that impressed with the menu options. We ended up getting a dozen oysters and they were very good. I don't remember what salad we chose but it was okay.Out drinks were terrible. It was basically pink lemon juice, not lemonade, straight up super sour lemon juice.I may have thought differently if I got the recommended chicken for two.Not a bad place but compared to everywhere else we went in San Fransisco "meh" is a good description.

Fantastic dining experience! The ambiance is great in the light filled dining area with piano playing in background- I like the old school feel. Service was top notch as well. Now to the most important- the food. The Caesar and arugula salads were both fantastic- the Caesar was a solid portion. The gnocchi appetizer was unreal, rich and had the light and fluffy texture of scrambled eggs. The shoestring fries were also very good. I had to order this since it looked and smelled so good when I saw someone else order it at the bar. And finally the sea bass o the menu was fantastic. It was seared lightly to trap moisture and perfectly cooked and seasoned with butter and salt. Really tasty. I cannot believe it took me this long to go to Zuni but this is one of my new favorites!

Service was impeccable, ambiance on point, the restaurant itself is beautiful. This is classic simple dining done well, it is not a new fusion restaurant or play on unique flavors it is a combination of Cali cuisine mixed with traditional French & Italian flavors and techniques, diners should keep this in mind. Yes it is just roast chicken so if you expect something more go elsewhere. This was a great date dining experience with my bae. The bread salad and chicken was good, personally I am a saucy person so I would have liked a little more sauce to the bread salad but nonetheless it was great. We also did the appetizer that night which was fried oranges, I believe, they were amazing! I would go back just for these.Pre diner was craving a bloody mary with was not very good by the bartender (no olives or garnishes whatsoever), note to self stick with wine next time.

My boyfriend and I came here last week for pre-Opera dinner (sometimes we're fancy) after walking by for the past year and always noticing how busy Zuni is. We had a bit of hassle making a reservation since you can only book a table 1 month in advance which appears to be a necessity no matter which night you go if you plan on eating during prime hours. The earliest reservation was 6pm (even though they are open earlier) which, for a 7:30pm show, is kind of tight, but we wanted to try this place badly. I knew from Yelp and 7x7 that we needed to order the famous Chicken for 2. Unfortunately, this takes an hour to cook which would have made it impossible to fit in with our timing constraints. When they called to confirm, I asked if I could put in an order for the chicken so it was ready by 6:15, fully prepared to prepay for dinner so it would be ready. While I thought this was a reasonable request, they refused but said that we could come in at 5:30pm or so and we would get seated. I worked from home and my boyfriend left work early all for this friggin' chicken.And was it worth the hassle and $58? Meh. Was it the juiciest chicken I have had? Sure. Was the bread salad delicious? Yes. Were my socks knocked off? Definitely not. The beauty of the chicken is its simplicity but that is also its downfall. I really see the similarity other reviewers have pointed out to your basic rotisserie chicken. Is Zuni's better? Yes but not for 3-4x the price. I also had a nice glass of Pinot Noir (recommended to pair by the waiter) and my boyfriend had a cocktail which he seemed to like. That being said, with tax and tip added, we paid $110 for 2 people for 2 drinks and a bigger entree. This price isn't TOO bad for a nice restaurant but for a simple roasted chicken and 2 drinks, it just simply isn't worth it.The service was definitely fitting of a place at this price point and the atmosphere was really quite nice, especially with the live music later in our meal. However, this was disrupted by the anti-trump protesters walking down Market Street during dinner. With a place with huge windows like Zuni, we were able to get dinner and a show :)

Had the tomato soup and beet salad. The salad was great..it had pomegranate seeds and greens and chia seeds. The soup was a little more like a minestrone vase versus a bisque bit it was also good. For desert we had the thumbprint cookies and almond horchata which were excellent in terms of texture and flavor. All in all great food and good prices.

I live in the neighborhood and have been here a few times for both dinner and brunch. I've ordered all the signature dishes (chicken & bread salad, burger, shoestring fries, etc) and then some, but most dishes do not blow me away. However, the space is beautiful with its floor-to-ceiling windows and their drink menu is extensive. My most recent dinner at Zuni is likely my last at this establishment. My husband and I ordered the caesar salad, arugula salad, farrotto, skirt steak and the chocolate gateau (two starters, two entrees and a dessert + drinks). Nearly everything was tasty but service was the worst I've experienced in recent memory anywhere. First, the food:- Arugula salad - Light and refreshing, serving size for one. Recommend.- Caesar salad - This is huge and should be shared (wish our server told us this!). The dressing tastes classically caesar, but could use a bit more anchovy and more pepper. Good amount of croutons and parm.- Farrotto - Delicious. Light and very flavorful.- Skirt steak - The horseradish sauce was underwhelming with no kick, but everything else was as expected (the steak cooked to requested temp, potatoes and broccoli rabe). An average meat and potatoes dish.- Chocolate gateau - OMG, heavenly flourless chocolate cake topped with whipped cream.Service:- Our server was Jeremiah. At first, I didn't notice anything odd about him but it became clear throughout our meal that he was warm and chatty with everyone else but us. He barely made eye contact with us, barely said anything (he muttered indecipherably when he did bother to speak) and his behavior overall was very obviously colder towards us compared to all other tables. I have no idea why he was drastically different with us but it was completely unwarranted. We're repeat customers, were dressed appropriately for the setting, were excited to be dining again at Zuni and ordered a proper full meal. Jeremiah, oddly, made sure to tell another table that they could read about him on Yelp so he clearly looks himself up here. In case he's reading, I deliberately left him a paltry 15% tip because he deserved no more. I should've left 10% but since he looks rather old and is still waiting tables, I'll assume he needs the money. I happily leave 20-25% for good service, 30% for great. Jeremiah provided garbage service and I really don't care if I came off looking cheap (I retired at 34, and live and own real estate in SF; I'm doing alright). Screw that guy.It is worth mentioning that all the patrons at the other tables Jeremiah was serving were white, and he himself is white while my husband and I are not. Jeremiah's obvious lack of customer service towards us may have been for any number of reasons that I'll never know. But what I need to point out is that his behavior sure felt overtly racist, regardless of whatever his personal beliefs actually are about race. This is especially disappointing considering how diverse and accepting SF is in general; I have never actually been treated this poorly in my decade of living here.
