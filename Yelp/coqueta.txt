my sister and friends asked me to pick a place for my birthday brunch and this is my choice since I've been wanting to try here for AGEScame yesterday and our server was so wonderful we started off with the red wine sangria (yummy)1. the chorizo skewer - this was no bad but was literally just two bites 2. the potato chips - such smokey deliciousness esp. with the vermouth hot sauce that came with (will definitely order again next time)3. the duck & pork meatballs topped with fried shallots- we liked them so much we ordered seconds! they were THAT good3. the wild mushrooms- we ordered seconds of this as well - these were so flavorful 4. the paella - there were generous amount of shrimps and clams in this dish and the portion was quite big to feed the 4 of us - the rice was delicious 5. the roasted sweet peppers with slivers of Spanish ham - the peppers were so sweetly smokey 6. Spanish ham with thin toasts - so glad we ordered this after we like the slivers of ham tat came with the sweet peppers7. deviled eggs - this was not too bad we finished off by ordering 4 different desserts to share and the server threw in a freeby for the birthday girl the churro was delicious on its own - but it came with a chocolate dip as well (not needed)the chocolate fudge cubes came with a delicious creamy chocolaty sauce - this was very enjoyable I picked some cake thing that was filled with a yummy cream there was one other (don't remember the name) but it reminds me of bread pudding - we like this as wellthe free dessert was 4 lollipop things that turns out to be really great bite size cheesecakes so looking forward to returning FYI it's easier to get brunch reservations than for dinner

I'm not great at deciding how spanish food is, and I was hesitant about eating in this area, but I really enjoyed this place! Kind of between a three and a four to me for the food, but since it was such a good experience overall, I'll round up haha.I came here with a coworker and we both enjoyed our meal. The drinks were fantastic. She got the gin and tonic, and it was so pretty with a flower in it and some other plant type things haha. Tasted good too! I got the spicy margarita, which was excellent. Not too sweet and the pepper in it was pickled, which was gross at first and then perfect.We tried the mushrooms, the duck and pork meatballs, the octopus, and the egg and shrimp potato thing.My favorite was the mushrooms. They were cooked so perfectly with a smoky sear. I really loved the mix of different mushroom textures. I also liked the octopus, which was tender, but had a little less flavor. The potatoes in that dish seemed a little undercooked to me, but I like mushy potatoes, so that could just be me. The meatballs were good too, though I feel like they were less weird than the menu made them seem. The eggs and shrimp was my least favorite. It had potato strings and baby shrimp that were kind of flavorless.Overall a fun meal, and especially for this area, I was pleasantly surprised with it. Prices weren't awful either, with both of us being perfectly full and spending less than ninety dollars before tip - not bad for small plates! It was really busy but the service was great. Several food runners to help out as well as an attentive and knowledgeable server.

Writing my review after my second visit here. It wasn't as good as I remembered the first time - but still worth the visit.Usually I'd recommend more small plates than mains, but here I'd say save room for the pallets and split it with 2-3 people.Also the chorizo / shrimp / over easy egg tapa is amazing - you may not want to share it. Besides that the drinks were good, lamb meatballs also quite good, and I like how they cooked the octopus.Service is attentive and friendly and not overbearing. In the end - expensive, but worth it.

Love, love, love Coqueta. We were here for a birthday gathering that lasted from 1-5:30. Terrific Spanish inspired food. We had a lot of shared bites, all were tasty. Drinks were luscious, especially the special margarita. There is an "outdoor" space that is under glass, the indoor rooms is rustically beautiful. Service was impeccable, vibe is great. A place to go for a special occasion or on a regular basis.

Welllllllllll I have a confession Snapchat has taken over my need to Yelp but our impromptu meal here the other night has brought me back to my roots! Soooo after an early evening perusing the strip clubs on Broadway my main lady and I were hungry and I wanted Zarzuela but they close at 10 and Yelp led us to Coqueta. We sat ourselves on the bar side of the restaurant and enjoyed views of the bridge and people watching the late night crowd on the Embarcadero. We ordered white sangria which was so yummy and came out fast. I ordered for us and we had the potatoes, the chicken croquettes, the pork and duck meatballs, the octopus and for dessert the churros and cheesecake. Everything was great! Food came out fast, presented perfectly as tapas can be and service was efficient and nice. $85 bucks for two people before tip is fair to me! We will definitely repeat.

I'm torn on whether to bump what would be a standard 3.5-star Yelp review up to 4 stars or to round it down to 3. Yes, the Coqueta offers a solid take on traditional tapas dishes. But - also - yes, the ever-so-slightly-spendy prices and the ever-so-slightly-tiny portions (even for tapas) reflect its unbeatable waterfront location.To start, a selection of pintxos (bite-sized skewers) at $2.75 each (see pictures below) was an interesting way to taste several different things at once, but let's be honest, from a sizing perspective these would barely pass for acceptable hors d'oeuvres at a reception. Indeed, the sizing was so small that it was hard to taste anything to begin with before it all went down. More savory dishes like croquetas, albongidas (meatballs), and open-faced salmon sandwiches were far more satisfying, whether from a taste, quality, or value perspective. But let's hope this doesn't give Croqueta an opportunity to raise what are fairly reasonable prices any further for these items.Service at the bar was decent enough. The crowd appeared to skew more towards less-knowledgeable tourists and business folks with healthy expense accounts. Would the whole experience be as compelling if it were located somewhere sleepier? Hmmmmm... I'll have to get back to you on that one.

Atmosphere [4/5]: they have a bar area and a dining area separated. The bar was very crowded when I went there on weekends. The restaurant was a little bit hot and they had to keep the door open. Food: - Uni Bun [4.5/5]: don't remember the exact name of the dish lol. The Uni was pretty fresh! But I wish they could have a more kick flavor.  - Kale Salad [3.5/5]: the salad is a bit salty and did not quite enjoy the goat cheese personally.  - Spanish tortilla skewer [4/5]: in general, it's a pretty good little bite. And it would be better if it's warmed.  - Paella [5/5]: highlight of the dinner! Plenty of seafood and the rice was just cooked perfectly. I had always found paella was too salty, but this one was not!  We got too full to try some desserts. Probably gonna try their churro next time here!

Cute little place I've been wanting to try for awhile. Located on embarcadero close to Ferry Building, this place is a gem. They built this covered glass area which is an extension of the actual building. Nice views of the water. This place gets packed. We came here wanting a table but opted for the bar area in the glass room instead since we were starving and didn't want to wait. Had a few unique drinks. All sounded unique but I love gin so opted for that. Forgot all the names but tried 3 and all were pretty good. Shared a bunch of stuff ranging from the croquettes (which were delicious and maybe one of best items), deviled eggs (which I wouldn't get again since they were small and basically $3.50 a piece), mushroom salad thing, meatballs (also really tasty), and we finished off with the churro dessert (comes with chocolate sauce which was okay).

Been here twice, once three years ago and a couple months ago. Both times with a walk in or with a reservation I got trapped sitting at the bar and I hate bar seating. I"m not sure if you can request a regular table when making reservations. I also tried to go last Thursday but they said they were 100% booked for the whole night and the bar was packed so I ended up at La Mar instead. Their shrimp dishes here are solid. My favorite is the one with the fried egg. I would probably pass on their small bites next time because they are TINY and when you add up the prices it really doesn't make sense because if you get four small bites you can pretty much get a regular sized dish that isn't literally half a bite sized. Service is always nice here and its always popping. Great views, solid drinks. Perfect for date night! I love their sangria but honestly kind of pricey. Last time I came I spent more on the booze than the food and the food was not cheap.

Celebrated my 6th birthday meal at coqueta last night and the food and drinks were all it lived up to be. The pintxos were beautifully presented and the drinks were beautified with fresh flowers and fruits. It is true that we also eat with our eyes and coqueta didn't disappoint. The prom and duck meatballs were amazing as well as the branzino and paella. But the dish that stole the show was the gaucho bistec, a 32oz bone in cowboy ribeye cooked to perfection! I could not recall having a better piece of steak in my lifetime. It was tops!The desserts were also cute and well thought out. The single bite of the manchego cheesecake pop with caramel popcorn was decadent and dessert perfection. The only reason why this is not a five star review is that there is a serious wind problem in the restaurant. We sat near the door which we had to request the staff to try to keep closed. The door was open for the first 10 minutes we sat down and I'm not exaggerating, it was like sitting in a wind tunnel and getting your body fully blow dried at a car wash. I sincerely hope that coqueta can build a wind-blocking wall, awning, or anything to try to remedy this problem. We were not the only table discomforted by this issue and it put a big damper on our otherwise flawless meal. At the end of the dinner, 2 out of 6 of our diners felt as if they caught a cold. But even with the wind issue, coqueta deserves its accolades and is still an excellent experience. The food and drinks will speak for themselves.

First thing I would say about coming to Coqueta is that it'll take a pretty penny to get full, with that said though, the food here is pretty amazing. I've been here twice now, and both times have been very consistent. My favorites here are definitely the lox and bagel and the octopus. A lot of restaurants tend to overcook octopus, but not here! It's extremely well flavored and cooked perfectly. Although, you only get one tentacle per serving...Other small bites here are also good such as the assortment of mini skewers, prawns, etc. I did want to try out the paella but didn't get a chance to, so perhaps next time. But like I said before, the bill will probably be well over $100 for 2 if you're planning to be full and have drinks as well. Speaking of drinks, the gin&tonics here are very good and the presentation is pretty spot on (for the IG fame).As far as the bad goes, there's not really a bad thing about coqueta besides the aforementioned slightly overpriced menu and occasional long wait times. So remember to book ahead for bigger parties and prepare to order A LOT if you're planning to get full. Other than that, this is a solid establishment!

This place is a home run! Anell our waitress was fantastic! It was my second time visiting Coqueta and the second time was exactly like the first and confirmed why I came back. Delicious tapas! Mmmm. And the wine list is impressive and has lots of options. We had two delicious bottles. One Tempranillo followed by a Rioja, both from Spain. We got the last bottle of Tempranillo and our waitress was able to find us a delicious alternative in the Rioja. So good. This is a place to come and share and just take in the night. You won't be disappointed as they treat each table with premium service.

WAY better than i expected!! Since I'm a big fans of wood-grilled seafood and meat, my friend Anna recommended this restaurant to me. Service: i called and made a dinner reservation in the morning on the same day, the hostess was apologetic and told me they only had availability at 5:30pm. Of course i wouldn't mind and was impressed with her nice attitude! I was blown away with their tapas, entrees and beverages!!1. Mar Y Montana ($14): toasted bread with parma ham and sea urchin. It was a good start but wasn't as great compared to the rest 2. Pulpo a la Parilla ($14): this grilled octopus with potato was one of my favorites! Octopus was so so so tendered and juicy!! A must try! 3. Pluma ($38): wood-grilled pork shoulder with honey-chilled glaze. Holy moly this was my another favorite! The meat was super juicy and flavored; never imagined pork shoulder could be that soft when i've had pork shoulder so many times in my life. I'd also recommend other yelpers can try it without the sauce - still amazing!! Literally to die for. This dish also reminds me of thai pork shoulder! 4. Paella ($45): Spanish rice with assorted seafood, lemon aioli and thyme. We ordered this at beginning of dinner, since it'd take 40 minutes. A little of dry side, but fresh seafood especially prawns. I guess the pork shoulder was too impressive and we were pretty full when paella came; i'd still recommend yelpers to give it a try - generous portion with fresh seafood! 5. Beverage - Barca Gin-tonic ($13): recommended by the waitress. Light, refreshing with a hint of grapefruit and pine! I loved how light it was, so it wouldn't outshine delicious tapas and wood grilled food! My friend ordered sangria and she loved it too! It was a great dinner experience! I look forward to trying wood-grilled steak, toasted bagel with smoked salmon and truffle honey and beautiful skewers. I'll definitely come back with more friends!!

If you're looking for some crazy amazing good times, this place is where it's at, especially with large groups.You know, it's one of those places that seem to just know what they're doing. From the wait staff, to the drinks, to the creative expressions of every dish, it's what exactly what SF represents when it comes to good food and vibes.Okay, what to get. Well, nearly every category on their menu is impeccable, but let's try:- Best drinks: I loved the gin and tonic cocktails. The margaritas are also a hit, with 'air' which basically means a foamy delicious margarita. - Best tapas: Do try the croqutas de pollo (a deep fried chicken pot pie in a stick), the pulpo a la parrilla (a wood-fired octopus cooked to perfection), duck and pork meatballs (so soft, so right), and the endives (this seems to be seasonal, but was stellar).- Best dessert: We were totally into the bizcocho de arroz con leche, which was like a crispy cake with rice pudding in the middle, topped with ice cream. Stellar.Bring a friend. Maybe a few, and enjoy one of the best places SF has to offer.

Who has two brunches on a lazy Sunday? We do!!! Started with sashimi and a pisco sour (for me) elsewhere, then came here to indulge even more. Worth the hype? I think so!Must order: --pulpo (octopus) I LOVE OCTOPUS, anything. Seriously, if you can't get with that... we can't be friends #sorrynotsorry BYE~ Coqueta's version was charred, smoky, and cooked to near perfection. There were a couple of pieces that were burnt to a crisp, not good. The rest of it was heaven~--jamon iberico de bellota Who needs an excuse for salumi?! Cured meats are one of my fav apps of all time, anywhere that offers it, I usually order it. There were many salty meats to choose from, but of course bestie ordered this particular one cuz he knows I love it. Awwwwww~--salmon ahumadoThis may be because I've been craving lox bagels, but damn this hit the spot. Perfectly bite sized perfection. Mmmmmm. I'm running out of words. Still full, brain function diminished. Le sigh. Pass!!!--mar y montanaWtf?! Can't believe they served this putrid uni. F'ing nasty. I had to spit it out. Yes, that bad. I almost threw up in my mouth. It was way past it's sell by date! Worst uni I've ever had. PASSSSSSSSS. NEXT!Must try the rib-eye and paella next time. They look delicious ;) P.S. If you're into imbibing on the weekends, or whenever. I'd suggest the "salt air margarita" It was fantastic! I could've had a dozen, but I didn't :p LMAO

If you love Spanish food, then Coqueta is the place to go. I love this restaurant, it's located at the beautiful Pier 5 so you can take a stroll after your meal and enjoy the scenery :)I always like to start with their pintxos (bite-size skewers) while waiting for my food to come out. You can ask your waiter to bring the whole pintxos board, and you just pick whatever you want. If they leave the whole board on your table, don't feel tempted/obligated to finish all of them. The pintxos is not expensive at $2.75 per skewer but they could add up. Their patatas bravas is the best one I've had in the city. It's lightly smoked and perfectly crispy. They are individual potatoes (small round yellow and purple) unlike the patatas bravas at other places.The sunny side up eggs with chorizo, shrimp and fries shoe string potatoes are also great and fun to eat. Just mix them up all together and enjoy the salty crispy goodness! I've tried all of the large plates and they are all awesome. The steak is juicy (order the wild mushroom as a side dish to compliment your steak). The whole grilled branzino is very fresh, simple and delicious. The Spanish iberico pork shoulder with the honey chili glaze is very tender and flavorful. Lastly, the paella is really delicious as well. The rice is perfectly cooked and the seafood taste really fresh; it's served with some sliced pickled pepper and lemon aioli. Yum!

Tl;dr - service was great, drinks and food were good, but portions were small and very pricey for what you get. Nothing wow'd me.I've been meaning to try this place for a really long time and finally was able to for a bday celebration. We started off with 2 gin and tonics (one Barca gin tonic and the other tarif). Barca tasted very floral and was quite refreshing. Tarif was interesting and tasted more savory with the ham infused gin. Onto the food. We had:-Pan con tomate (tomato bread - very tasty where you smear a tomato concoction onto some toasty bread with a pinch of salt)-Jamon iberico de bellota (love this cured meat, but was pricey at $29)-Salmon ahumado (very tasty w the truffle honey and salmon, but extremely small portions)-Patatas bravas (crispy, but flavor was only ok)-Croquetas de pollo (hot and crispy with a rich, creamy filling)-Sunny side up huevos (too salty, but liked the texture of the runny eggs mixed w the crispy potatoes)-Pulpo ala parilla (octopus was cooked nicely but was a little bland in flavor)-Gaucho (my fav out of all we ordered! Rib eye was cooked perfectly and had really good flavors, but at $84 it was not quite worth it IMO)-Pluma (tender pork with a touch of sweetness from the glaze)Overall, don't think I'd come back due to small portions and high prices for what you get. Nothing particularly wow'd me.

Quaint tapas bar but packs a punch. I came here with no reservation and ended up dining at the bar. It was fine, super spacious and a lovely view of the bay. I love having lots of little plates and things to sample from throughout the night. There is so much on this menu that I wish I came with a bigger group to get the chance to try more. Of course we got one of each for the bite-size skewers. I feel like you just HAVE to try them. They're each pretty unique and yummy. They're really good snacks. I wish we could have stomached the paella, but we had enough food. (Maybe next time!) I also got the octopus and shrimp. Both I recommend. I tend to always order octopus when it's on the menu. There's just something about the texture of it that I love. Now the shrimp, I HIGHLY recommend. It was SOOOOO good. It was extremely flavorful and so good. I'll be back to this place some time again.

Updated review
Last night, I took my friend here for the first time. Food was delicious as always. We ordered two orders of the smoked salmon open faced sandwiches because they are really that good! Everything was great food wise. But the service from our waiter, Dean, was minimal. We barely saw him during service and we had to ask the waiters around us for water and other drinks etc. We sat down to order approximately at 745... knowing clearly what we want. The apps and smaller plates came out beautiful! But then it went downhill. My friend and I sat there for the next 25-30 min wondering where our mains were. We had to ask several times to several different people and would get, "just a few minutes." The manager came over to offer us free dessert and tried to explain that the paella takes 45 min. Sure, but if we put our order in at 745 and it's now 915, how do you explain that? Well, I'll be back regardless, but it's so disappointing when the service is not on par with the food. Kills the experience, especially for my friend who was there for the first time.

Phenomenal food, slightly snobby service. Came to SF on a work trip, hubby flew down for the short weekend. We stopped here on the rave reviews of wonderful tapas bites. The reviews surely were not wrong! We had machego skewers, quail egg tasters, a LOT of tasty cocktails. I mean, everything was fantastic. The only reason why it wasn't 5 stars was the snobbery. So if you're reading this looking for excellent food, ignore the rest of this review; it's worth it! Alright, we're the average millennial couple. Well-off, but by no means in the typical SF way. We eat moderate portions and try to spend responsibly since we don't make millions. Well we made a late night reservation, came 15 min early, and as I was checking in, after noticing some empty seats, asked if there was a chance to be seated early. The waitress literally laughed in my face. "People don't cancel reservations here! Don't think you'll be seated early!" I will say, we didn't bring umbrellas, and it was pouring.. maybe our soaked jackets pointed to "POOR" status. Ok. Just asking! We can wait 15 minutes. Choked back a laugh when another waiter came up a few seconds later and was like, "some people cancelled; would you like to be seated a bit early at the bar?" Ha! The look they exchanged was horrific. So we're seated, ordered cocktails and about 7 tapas. Everything is fantastic, this new waiter was great! He asks if we want more drinks, we oblige. Fast forward to many tapas and 2 drinks later, he asks if we want another round or drinks (3rd), we decline. BAM. It was if a switch turned off. We couldn't flag him down for ANYTHING after that. No water refills, no more tapas orders. We still had 5 or more tapas to go through with no water. Had to get up to get the bill. Still paid over $150 for drinks and snacks.. I know people can drop thousands.. but being treated like the poor people was humiliating and put a sour note to the end of the night. The food was indeed fantastic though; and begrudgingly I would still go back despite the service since the food was that good. Maybe I'll be richer next time ;)

Mancheo pintxos - yumSmoked salmon sandwich - yumKale salad - surprising yumPatatas bravas - extra surprising yum....for potatotes!Octopus - I passed, but other "yums" around the tableDuck + pork meatballs - OMG YUMManchego cheesecake - kill me now.Thanks to Coqueta, my ever-growing love of tapas is only going to continue to grow (as will my waistline). While we certainly overate and over-ordered, we never would have been able to have this much variety at another kind of restaurant. I'm a fan and can't wait to come back!

Mixed feelings about this place. Our orders were good if not necessarily anything special. I'd like to see some reassurance on the menu that their seafood and meat is sustainably sourced and cruelty-free. (I looked, but if any such reassurance is there, I missed it.) Sure, tapas ain't usually cheap, but this is just overpriced. If it's going to be expensive, the food should ethically sourced. I just hope that the expense means the workers are paid well. Something I value most regardless of a restaurant's fanciness factor is when a place makes an effort to be accessible to everybody including poor, working, and middle class people. Coqueta caters to the city's gentrifiers with its tech and financial industry diners conversing tersely at the bar or "bonding" with awkward, noticeable artifice over group lunches. No community vibe or sharing here. It felt like walking into an exclusive club that you don't want to be in. Anybody looking to support something that feels welcoming and relatable in the way we like to be here in the Bay will be disappointed. This place feels surprisingly cold for a tapas bar, which, when done right, should be a hub of social warmth. Coqueta needs to invite more diversity to make its groove more friendly.With a few alterations, Coqueta could be a happier dining experience, but I won't be back until I see changes to their social commitments and menu.

Michael Chiarello's foray into Spanish tapas is a smashing success!Come with a large group of people because this menu is meant to be shared and you're going to want to get as many dishes as possible.The presentation of each dish is great and the flavors of each were spot on. Highlights include the salmon ahumado and the suckling pig. The salmon was definitely my favorite dish. It's a bite sized open faced sandwich that's loaded with smoked salmon and brushed with truffle honey and garnished with some rosemary. Head on gulf prawns and grilled octopus dishes were good as well. There's also larger meat dishes and a paella if you aren't full after the assortment of tapas.Ambiance and decor is wonderful and well thought out. There's a nice outdoor seating area complete with a bar so you can get breathtaking views of the bay and Bay Bridge.

I'm a fan of this place mainly because of their drink menu, but was surprised to find the tapas so pleasant during my visit last weekend. It was pouring rain and I'd just finished with a tour of Alcatraz so, Saturday cocktails were very much in order. I always opt for the Barca G&T because of its aromatic beauty. The presentation is magical and the tonic water is definitely the star of the show. We also ordered some xips, padron peppers and a few pinxos to accompany our drinks and they were all lovely. Nothing new to report here. It's still a 5 star kind of place for casual "pop ins" on the weekend.

It only took a few years (better late than never, right?), but I finally got a chance to dine at Coqueta. It was the best place to celebrate my milestone birthday, and could not have asked for better food, service, and ambiance. First off, always make reservations here! Thankfully, my girls did so a few weeks to a month in advance to secure a prime Saturday evening reservation. It was a perfect SF evening, and the views were spectacular since it was a clear and fogless night. The interior is sexy and inviting, but not pretentious. Our table had a view of the kitchen, and they were hustling. Hillary, our amazing server, was outstanding as she's friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and wish ever server could be like her! Fabulous drink menu, from mezcal to gins, and they are just so pretty! (see pics). They even surprised me with a take on my favorite Moscow Mule. Later on, we also ordered a pitcher of white sangria. Sweet, fruity liquid gold!Ok, here's what we ordered:El Plat Cap - chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses. Si si!Patatas bravas - spanish staple, and is excellent! Definite must order. Croquetas - another spanish staple, and a must order. Fried perfection.Albondigas a la feria - duck and pork meatballs. Absolutely delish and flavorful.Sunny side up huevo - ordered two of these because it was a favorite of everyone. The flavors and the textures of the egg, shrimp, crispy potato! OH MYLANTA!Paella - YES! Must order! Of course, it took about 30-40 minutes, but we had enough drinks and tapas to keep us busy. And for the finale, the gals surprised me again with a ginormous dessert platter. It's basically everything on their dessert menu served on this wooden board that's longer than our server Hillary's arm. The churros were my favorite.Many thanks to my galpals, Hillary and staff at Coqueta. It was a memorable birthday celebration, and cannot wait to return. PS There are only 2 bathrooms and are actually both unisex. PSS Pay attention to the small plates as they are all Spanish themed and made locally by an Oakland artist.

This review won't be very helpful. However, I wanted to write this review so I remember that I went there. :)The ambiance is very nice and good for dates. The food was yummy, though I can't remember what I ate.

When I lived in the city I came here often. I never ate in the restaurant just the separate bar area. It's a great spot to go before a dinner or before a night out. They make amazing and strong drinks. They have a gin and tonic drink with flowers in it that sounds disgusting but the tonic water they use has sweet flavors. It's delicious and looks classy as well. I've had a couple of their tapas which are good but not cheap. The Sunny-side up is one of my favorites along with the huevos nacional. I couldn't find it on the menu so maybe it was seasonal when I went but it was a watermelon and prosciutto cold tapa and it was great. The serving size are good for about 2 people. If you have a group then order a lot and definitely get one of the cheese/meat boards. You can make reservations online through open table and I highly recommend it, this place is small and gets packed quick.

My husband and I went here last night for a laid back date night. Coqueta had been recommended to me by a coworker about a month ago after I had mentioned that I had never experienced true tapas. Her husband is from Spain and she is very well travelled so I trusted her recommendation for an authentic experience. Reservations for a reasonable dinner time for two people was about 3 weeks out, but boy was it worth the wait.First before you read a long winded review, let me cut to the chase. Get the plumas!!! Just get it, don't rethink it! Literally the BEST grilled pork I have had in my life. It was grilled perfection with melt in your mouth unctuous-ness that takes a delicate hand that only a truly adept grill master can achieve. Hats off to whoever made that piece of meaty perfection for us last night. It will be a meal we talk about for the rest of our lives, so thank you to whoever you are!Okay, so now that I have that out of the way, for the small plates, we started with the bread with iberico ham. Then we got chicken croquettes that were breaded in pork rinds. The next items we ate were grilled octopus on potatoes and manchego cheese with that delicious ham. All of the small plates beautifully composed and each bite was a nicely built flavor composition. For dessert, my husband got the churros with hot chocolate and I got the cheesecake bites. While both were delicious, the churros were special. The outside was crispy and the interior was so soft it was creamy. Anyway, every plate went back to the kitchen clean with not even a speck of food, so you really do need to order quite a few plates to be full at the end. It was really fun to receive each plate to enjoy each one in its own time.The wait staff was great and the timing of the plates coming to the table had a nice rhythm. All in all a great experience. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice night out. We will definitely be back.

Been wanting to go back to this place since my last visit in March 2015 but it's so hard to get a reservation here plus the fact that there are so many great restaurants in the city so here I am looking at the pictures I took and thinking about the fond experience I had with Coqueta. The food and drinks were great! We ordered what most popular based on existing Yelp pictures. Service was also satisfying. Adding all of these to the amazing view of Bay Bridge and the water does warrant a solid 4.5 star rating. ^_^

This is a review for lunch. Food: 5 stars, come here for the food, it's amazing! Ambiance: 5 stars - beautiful rustic dining room.Service: 3 stars, the waiter was a bit a snob; snooty comments were not very appropriate. It was my birthday lunch and but the server had no clue, until it as mentioned. Value: 3 start - it's very expensive to eat. The portion size was small for the price. Charging $2 for hot sauce, $5 for bread and charging for the birthday dessert was a bit excessive.

For the price of eating here I was sorely disappointed.The only thing that was fantastic was the croquettes and the duck meatballs. Everything else (cheese plate, shrimp, fries with egg), was a disappointment.They need to revisit their menu and make some changes.Additionally the waiter was kind of rude when I said I just wanted to order tapas when he tried to convince me to order the paella. He said,"Paella is tapas". Oh dear sir, have you been to a tapas bar in Spain? Paella is not tapas.

I planned a team happy hour here and couldn't be any happier with this event! We booked the room/bar area and had our own bar tender. The service was awesome, the people who worked with me during the event were very helpful and nice. My boss is vegan/gf and they were able to accommodate her as well. The drinks are so yummy, pretty and very creative. The cheese board and all the little apps we had were delicious. I hope to come here again for dinner. The presentation and atmosphere was delightful. Its on the pier so you get a really nice view of the Bay Bridge.

Simply delicious. The service was phenomenal. The wine was amazing. The food was fantastic. We started with the large cheese platter, followed by several of the tapas. The potatas bravas and smoked salmon stand out right now. It was all very good. They also have a lot of gorgeos cocktails to choose from if wine or beer isn't your thing!

Good food: check. Great service: checkLocation: checkCame here for a lunch with coworkers and we really enjoyed it! Coquetta is a Spanish tapas place so expect to share dishes with your party. Each dish that we ordered was unique and very flavorful. I definitely recommend the deviled eggs, the smoked salmon, and the sunny side up huevo. We also LOVED the kale salad (I never thought I would say I love kale in this lifetime). I'd say if you were planning on coming here, make a reservation because the place seemed pretty full when we got there. The food comes out pretty quick but they space them out so that not all dishes come out at once. This restaurant is great for a casual lunch with friends or coworkers so I highly recommend it!

Our food was beautiful and as delicious as it looks! Be ready to splurge though! I have never been to Coqueta before but I have seen how beautiful their drinks are here, so I took the opportunity to come here for lunch and we were so glad we came! The first impression I had when I walked into this place was it gets rather stuffy on a warm day. The cheeses and cured meats didn't act as a air freshener either, so I was first quite surprised but later adjusted to the smell. We opted to set at the bar to admire their open kitchen. My friend and I settled on ordering a few tapas along with drinks for lunch. Our waitress was a delight and she recommended that for a party of two, it's best to order 4 - 5 tapas to be full for lunch. We ordered their famous Gin & Tonics. I got their Barca Gintonic and my friend got their Galleon (both $13) to start. Their drinks are absolutely beautiful with floral pieces floating and the drinks were strong. I liked how our waitress only poured half of the tonic water into the gin to make it strong! The Barca Gintonic was citrusy, refreshing, and delicious. My friend also enjoyed her Galleon but did say it does not taste as strong as the Barca. For our tapas, we ordered the following:- Croquetas de Pollo ($9) - crunchy on the outside, cheesy, melty, packed with chicken flavor deliciousness on the inside. They paired very well with the refreshing gintonics. - Sunny side-up Huevo ($13) - a little bit too oily and salty for our taste but it was still good. Our waiter first served it prior to mixing then proceeded to mix it in front of us at the table.- Pulpo de Parilla ($14) - Yum! the octopus was super tender and soft. It was also very fresh since the octopus had a strong taste of the ocean. haha.- Albondigas a la Feria ($14) - the meatballs were super flavorful and tender. It was served with some caramelized onions for that salty and sweet flavor that was wonderful.- Salmon Alhumado ($8) - Absolutely DELICIOUS! Winner of the day!! Sad that it was $4 for each bite. The smoked salmon was at excellent quality and the truffle honey was mind blowing. The flavor contrast from the salty smoked salmon and the truffle honey paired super well together and the truffle enhanced all of the flavors and blended them together. It was like a flavor explosion in the mouth. Encore!!!We were stuffed at the end of the meal and were happy to say the dishes were all very good! Our bill came to be $125 plus tax for two, which definitely is not your normal daily lunch! I highly recommend coming here and just try their gintonics and a few tapas, you will for sure not be disappointed! Definitely order their smoked salmon tapa!!

I went here for drinks after dinner and loved their selection of gin based drinks. They beautifully present the drinks, I got the Barca Gintonic, which is a Bloom London Dry Gin with botanical tonic, grapefruit and thyme. I do prefer a stronger Gin taste, but this was great as a sundowner to end a perfect sunday. The place was a bit busy, but we managed to get seats inside pretty quickly. I haven't tasted any of their food, but definitely come back for their drinks.

5 of us had a massively good time. Service was outstanding, manager was hilarious, food was spectacular and the drinks were sweet nectar. This place is high end $$$ but it delivers. If you want to pay for greatness, this is the place. Plus, it's on the water and the small, historic building provides a great atmosphere.

I don't remember much. I was a blur of excellent food, drink, and company. I get flashes of:+The excellent house gin & tonic+How odd and yet so satisfying the salmon, honey, cream cheese was+How we savagely devoured the meat and cheese platter+The tasty, tasty octopus+The mouth-wateringly spicy peppersI desperately try to recall dessert, but only get glimpses of sigh-worthy churro and manchego cheese bites. Pass.I'm going back for more of that G&T and that platter of goodness.

We loved, loved, loved Bottega in Yountville and were hoping to have a similar experience here at Coqueta. While I'm giving a four star rating for the quality of the food, I can't honestly give the same score for the value. I understand that part of what I'm paying for is the location and the view.Service was good so far as explaining the menu, checking back frequently, keeping our water full and answering questions. The one negative factor might be the pacing of the dishes. We started with a pitcher of Sangria and the El Gran Plat Cap (Chef's Grand Selection of Cured Meats and Cheeses). We added on the imported Jamon Iberico de Bellota. Also on the wood platter was Pan con Tomate, which I was surprised to find we were charge for. Before we were 1/2 way finished with this appetizer, we were served the Broccolini with Romesco Sauce. We opted to finish our meats and cheeses before digging into the now cold Broccolini.The other tapas came out in a way that made sense except for the Pulpo which didn't come out until I asked for it after the Paella was served. The best dishes of the evening were the Patatas Bravas, Albondigas (Duck & Pork Meatballs) and Setas al Ajillo (Wild & Culitivated Mushrooms with Garlic, Chilli and Sherry. The Paella was okay. The head-on Gulf Shrimp were beautiful and the Garlic Scapes surprisingly peppery but the rice did not give me the full bodied saffron and seafood broth flavor that I was craving. The search for perfect Paella continues!

I am so happy I finally went there, because it's my favorite restaurant in the city now. What to order: 1. Bite size tapas: olives with anchovies and Chorizo with artichoke. We also ordered manchego cheese with prosciutto and it was whatever. 2. Jamon is always so so fresh. 3. Goat cheese is beyond amazing. 4. Patatas Bravas - you would be able to stop, that's how amazing it is. 5. Gambas Negras - perfectly done prawns 6. Pulpo a la Parrilla - we had to order two, because one dish was not enough. 7. And last but not least - "Bikini" - for those, who usually don't order desert, should have this dish for last, it will substitute any dessert. We also ordered chips, but they were not my favorite, maybe because I don't usually eat chips. I cannot wait to go there again!

It's expensive for sure, but the quality of food cannot be beat. Also, how are you going to beat this ambiance? I can't say much about authenticity, but I can say that you will have some fine food. It did take them extra time to get out our order, as our waitress informed us that there was a problem with one of our plates, so what did she do? She created a skewer platter for us with over 40 skewers. Is that service, or what? The food here is amazing. Yes, the pluma pork loin is $38 for a small board of meat, but oh my goodness. That pork loin tastes better than most steaks I've eaten, and we've been around the block (Nick and Stef's, CUT, 5A5, ink., Gordon Ramsay, Aureole, etc.). Start with the charcuterie board (the bread is killer), move on to their own play on patatas bravas (whole, small roasted potatoes), and then have some of verduras (broccolini with pine nuts, garbanzo beans, and garlic) to go with that tender piece of perfectly cooked and cut meat. Will definitely be back.

All I can say is that a random friday night drink and snack couldn't be better. The staff is super cheerful and warm. I got the Salmon Ahumado and it was heavenly. Just plain yummy! I had the Galleon which seemed like a popular drink there and was not disappointed. Castro was good as well. Red sangria however was the winner of it all! Probably going to become a regular here!

So I thought this was nice enough -- and certainly better than I expected in the tourist trap area. But, I also thought it was a tad overpriced, the service particularly slow, and the servings smaller than one would even expect for a tapas place.Also - the chairs are uncomfortable, and the restaurant is loud.

Disappointed a place like this has waterfront view. If you know good food you would know this is NOT the place for that. That paella though, cmon that's not a paella...don't be fooled by the great location interior design and filled seats. Food is what you're paying for in the end, and if the foods not good, save your hundred$ you might end up blowing here.

The food here was amazing! We came here to celebrate 3 birthdays, so believe me, we pretty much ordered the entire menu - and there's nothing wrong with that! What makes this place great is that since most of their stuff is served as tapas, you have room to try eeerrryyything. Skewers were wonderful, the octopus was to die for, the potatoes were probably one of my favorites, and OMG please save room for the paella. And to top it off they served complimentary desserts for my friends. The churro with chocolate dip came out to be one of the best things I ate all night (and that's saying a lot since we ordered 20+ dishes). The service was also amazing - our waitress was sassy! And that just added more spice to our evening. Thank you Coqueta for a delicious and entertaining evening!

I absolutely love this place!! My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's. He knows how much I love Spain and tapas, and how much I've been dying to go back, so this was a perfect date. It was packed when we got there on a Saturday night, but of course, we had a reservation. We sat at the bar and it was awesome because we could see the cooks in kitchen in our view. It would have been nice to see the view of the pier, but I love watching people make food too lol! We ordered 3 different tapas. Salmon ahumado, pan con tomate, y sunny side huevo. I loved the salmon ahumado, it's exactly like the salmon bagels you get in a cafe. My boyfriend is from Ecuador and always raves about pan con tomate, so I'm glad I got to try it. It was good!! The bread was nice and crunchy, while the tomate was a nice acidity and you could add sea salt to it. The sunny side huevo is what I didn't picture, because I didn't really enjoy it. It was too oily for my taste, but my boyfriend finished it all up.We also ordered the paella and pluma. I've had paella in Spain, and it definitely doesn't compare- a little too dry, but still good flavors. The pluma was too die for!! My boyfriend and I literally fell in love. The sauce and tenderness were decadent. I can just think about how good it was and my mouth starts to salivate. I also had a yellow sangria, which was okay. I should've definitely just stuck to the red. We got the carajillo for dessert. Brandy ice cream with espresso poured over- so lovely! Perfect way to end our meal. Side note: you definitely want to be on the trendier side when dressed. Also, this is not a cheap place, but well worth the money.

Well - you won't be getting drunk here.The Mezcal I ordered was literately 1/4" of liquid at the bottom of the glass.Pinchinest shot of liquor I've ever had - 4 sips max.The food we ended up with was mostly sweet and salt based.Yeah - one can make cat droppings taste OK with enough salt 'n sugar.Croquetas de pollo (hot and crispy with a rich, creamy filling) with chicken bones.I suppose the diva chef wanted to add some crunch.The cheesecake on a stick was so sweet the GF couldn't eat it.The polite server inquired how it was and she gave it to her straight.Kudos for not charging us for it - that was nice.Still $160 for 3 "drinks", 2 beers and a few tapas.We skipped Kokkari to come here - duh.Ambiance - pretty much the elite crowd. Positive point - they did move us to a nicer table after we politely asked.

HELLA FANCE.I don't mind putting down the big dollas when it's worth it but MANN this place is PRICEEEEY. And it HURT.I will say, you are paying for quality, service, and ambiance.The interior decor is well thought out and everything is beautiful. Manly. Leather. Brown. Fancy mancave vibes. (Sorry that doesn't sound articulate, lol.. then again, I started my review with: HELLA FANCE. So there goes that.)The only thing to note is that it's very loud in here. I don't know what it is with the acoustics but I felt like I was straining to hear my friend across the table from me.Anyway, on to the food and drinks.Cocktails start at about $14, typical of the area. High quality ingredients and beautifully garnished. I got the Barca Gintonic and my friend got the Sutter Splash. Both were very well balanced and it was worth the price tag.FOOD.HUEVOS NACIONAL $7 - 3 STARS - $7 for one whole egg? It's only two halves. $3.5 per bite. Even ignoring the price tag, I didn't feel like it was all that great?!?!? Maybe I'm just not a fan of deviled eggs, and PAYING that much for a deviled egg. The flavors were very complex with the bonito and the pickled saffron potato. I appreciated the complexity, but I was still sad that it cost seven freakin' dollars and it didn't rock my socks off.ABONDIGAS, $14 - 4.5 STARS - 3 small meatballs. But, very rich. I cut my meatball into 4 pieces because it was that rich! This is something you want to savor and eat slow. Very rich in duck flavor, extremely soft & tender. Borderline almost falling apart even when moving it over to my plate! The cherry salsa and shallots on top were a perfect complement.PLUMA, $38 - 3.5 STARS - Everyone RAVED about this, so I ordered it.. and yeah... it was good pork and very tender. BUT IT WAS ALSO ONLY LIKE 8 PIECES. I don't mean to compare with House of Prime Rib.. but it's $50 over there, for a full slab of meat, plus a second slice, AND sides, soo..... it was hard for me to justify this. The honey chili glaze was interesting, but I would have preferred a more savory/heavy sauce. Tasted a bit bland on its own but i guess they wanted the meat to speak for itself.SETAS AL AJILLO (mushrooms), $10 - 5 STARS - SHIZ. Now these, I can justify paying more for. Perfectly roasted, extremely garlicky, and not too soft. I ate these with the pork shoulder and it made it 100% better, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Overall, I put down $125 after tax and tip for a satisfying meal.. 2x higher than I'd like but I guess I can check this place off the list since I had been curious about it for a while now.Don't think I would return unless a friend picked this place and it was for an occasion!

You know it's going to be good when they use copper cups for water. This place was great! We got the paella which was amazing, no addition to the octopus (pulpo a la parrilla) and duck and pork meatballs (albondigas a la feria)! Everything was fantastic! The paella is expensive but so good and so worth it, and it's a lot of food (just get it!). We also had a super cool drink that came in a traditional Spanish pitcher where one side allows you to pour it in someone's mouth, keeps dinner interesting ;) I would definitely come back here and you should definitely go here if you like Spanish tapas or seafood!
