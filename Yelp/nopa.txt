I've only been here once, and it was for brunch, but it was amazing enough to earn 1,000 stars. We went on a Saturday morning without reservations and stood in line for about 20 minutes outside before the doors opened. The bar seats filled up immediately but we got seats at the communal table and drinks from the bar while we waited. {note: this was one of the very few things I wasn't thrilled with - coffee was only served as a full or half carafe, no way to get a single cup. Womp womp.}Okay so on to the food. The waitress recommended ordering family style, so our party of 3 ordered: soft scrambled eggs, a half order of French toast, the butter basted eggs, smoked trout, and a plate of grilled bread. Wayyyyy too much food but it was so delicious that we managed to eat it all.The beauty of Nopa is that it can be a once in a lifetime, incredible dining experience, or just a quick weekend treat, but if you're doing the latter, go big and really enjoy it!

Jason and his fly ass red glasses were the dopest! Decided to come in late night on Friday after work. Lemme say from one bartender to another. Kudos dude. He was so personable,quick, and efficient. He really made dining at the bar feel top notch. My burger was the most beautiful medium rare I've ever seen. Damn, my mouth is watering at the delicious memory. I can't wait to go back!

I've been wanting to try Nopa for a long time now and finally mustered up the courage to check it out with a few friends. Of course for my first visit I had to try their famous Pork Chop, was it just as good as people say it is? I thought it was better. The bone in pork chop had a generous amount of savory juices and complex flavor. We also ordered a Flatbread with spicy fennel sausage, grapes, ham, and burrata which served as our appetizer while we waited for the real meal. I recommend making a reservation beforehand since this place always gets packed... if you didn't make a reservation don't worry, you can get there around 5pm to put your name down, grab a drink at the bar, and they start seating at 6pm. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, the dining area is a bright open floor with lots of natural light and tall ceilings, and there are seats upstairs that overlook the main dining area. Service was excellent and very helpful with cocktail suggestions. As you can tell, Nopa is a very popular destination for SF diners.

For my SF weekend trip I wanted to try some of the best SF had to offer. Did some research on some good brunch, dinner, and cocktail spots, and Nopa happened to be on alot of those lists for all three!! It was a no brainer to come here, just had that popular saturday brunch reservation. Looked on OpenTable and got a reservation for 2 at 1:15!!The place was pretty packed. We got seated on the second floor which gave us a pretty nice view of the whole restaurant. Started off with mimosas and bloody marys ofcourse. Heard the BURGER here is the BEST in SF, so I had to get it. Wow it was amazing! Moist,juicy cooked to perfection! Deff on my top 10 burgers of all time thats for sure. Don't really remember some of the other things we ate, because the food got finished pretty fast. But Nopa deff lived up to the hype. Theres a reason theres over 4k reviews, and practically on every food/drink list for San Francisco. Next time I come back to SF I am deff coming back here!!

WOW! Bravo!I got to Nopa on a Thursday at 5pm sharp knowing that this place is extremely popular. To my surprise, no one was around to put their name on the list so I was first. WOO! The hostess let us know we'd be seated at 615pm. We got cocktails in the meantime and Nopa was prompt about seating us at 615. There drink menu is extensive- lots of good cocktails to choose from (they are known for cocktails), lots of wine, and some beer. SO FOR MY BEER LOVERS- they have bottled Pliny the Elder!!!!!!!!!! COULD NOT NOT order it, so my friend and I went for the pliny instead of cocktails.To eat, we ordered the flatbread- Chorizo, Roasted Peppers, Sweet Corn, Arugula and Feta and the pork chop- Fingerling Potatoes, Wickson Apple Sauce, Mustard Greens and Walnuts. AND YUM! The flatbread was very good, perfect for two or three, and a great starter. The bread was warm, soft, and lightly coated in olive oil and just enough toppings where it's not considered a pizza. The main event, the pork chop! I'm not the biggest pork fan but had to order it and wasnt disappointed. It was juicy, full of flavor, and generously portioned. The applesauce/walnuts was a great touch!PS... PARKING- I found parking across the street! I believe if it's a weekday and you get there early before people are back from work, parking isn't too bad! I saw a few places to park nearby and lucked out with one across the street.

If you are wondering if you should make a reservation....stop reading. MAKE THAT RESERVATION. NOW. Okay, now that you've done the proper thing...you may continue reading. We came on a Friday evening; 6:15PM reservation. We arrived a little early, it didn't seem like they had sat anyone for dinner service yet. No problem - we headed to the bar. The service at the bar was fast. We were handed a cocktail menu as we walked up to the bar and the bartender took our order within minutes. My drink was ready within 5 minutes, even with a packed bar. (Think everyone who had ressies were at the bar.) I ordered The Summit (St. George Terroir Gin, grapefruit, lime, honey). Appetizers: Little Fried Fish - served with lemon and romesco. holy sh*t, party in my mouth. Best little anchovies I have ever had. EVER. The fry on it is perfect and I LOOOOVE that you can't feel the little bones in the anchovies. I told my boyfriend we should have ordered 2 orders of this. Avocado Toast - with pickled jalapenos, cucumbers, shiso, and toasted sesame seeds. Being a California girl, if I see avo-toast on the menu, I will order avo-toast. Man oh man, this did not disappoint. The avo was, I swear, 1.5 inches thick on the toast. The only downside is that you cannot eat this in one bite; you have to cut your toast. Entrees:Housemade Pappardelle - with 9 hour bolognese. This was good. Pappardelle cooked al dente. Bolognese was full of flavor. Order this. Do not share. Tell your friend/partner/table mate to get their own. Roasted black cod - with manila clams, mussels, fingerling potatoes, corn and tomatillo broth. Why have I never thought of using tomatillo in a broth? Oh, this is why I'm not a chef; durh. Tomatillo broth is soooo amazing; mind blown. The cod was cooked so perfectly. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times I've had fish cooked THIS well. It melted in my mouth. Also, I usually don't even like mussels...but I ate these. This speaks volumes. Sides: Grilled Broccoli - lemon, anchovy, and breadcrumbs. Get this. Thank me later.French Fries - basil parm aioli. We really only got this dish so we could have the aioli. 10/10 would order again, just for the aioli. Desserts: Brioche Donuts - 4/order. They are like beignets..so soft and so pillowy. So delicious.Cornmeal Crepes - meh. This was the only thing of our evening that disappointed. The ice cream was odd. The crepes were mediocre. The only great thing on this dish was the fresh peaches. *sad face*We will totally be back. And order the rest of the things on the menu. *nomnomnom*

Would give 5 stars for the food, but the service was a little pretentious. Waited about 45 min for a bar seat and despite asking the bartenders to let me know when they thought one might open up, they basically ignored me - even after I did manage to secure a seat. But as for the food, the pork chop lived up to the hype. And like many other comments, I'm not even a huge pork chop fan, but it was tender, full of flavor and the portion is ridiculous. I'd definitely come back and hope for a more welcoming atmosphere next time.

This is one of my favorite places in the city. Definitely top 10, if not too 5. Nopa is very quintessentially San Francisco: fresh, local ingredients, ever rotating menu that varies based on what's in season, spacious two-level seating with high ceilings, huge communal table up in the front of the restaurant and wide spacious bar area. This is the perfect place to go on a date (drinks or food), go out for brunch or dinner with friends, or people watch from the second floor (which is admittedly what a friend and I spent most of last night doing). The food is phenomenal. I haven't tried anything I didn't like yet. I've tried a variety of salads (including the melon salad and the tomato mozzarella salad), the tagine, burger, flatbread and a few brunch items. Everything was out of this world delicious. I generally don't even like tomatoes, but the tomato salad was so fresh, sweet and good that I was in love with the dish. Drinks are also unique and amazing. Cocktails are unique and not too sweet. Great wine selection. Good drinks, fantastic food, can't go wrong.

Heard a lot about this place and will say it lived up to its expectations.This place can be both casual and higher end depending on what you are in the mood for. The vibe is chill but food is top level.We started out with the ravioli type appetizer which were delicious. So fresh and well made. Also had the toast with the blueberry and cheese plate. Had a great flavor as well.For the entree i got the steak and my wife got the wife. The steak was perfectly cooked and the toasted nuts were a nice touch. The fish melted in our mouths. So flaky and fresh.You cant go wrong here. Come here if you are in the bay area.

Try to make a reservation here if you can in advance otherwise the wait can be around an hour+. There is a communal table up front that opens up and is perfect for a single or pair.Pork Chop - I usually don't order pork chops anywhere but this double chop is on the of my top list. Ordered medium rare and eats just like a juicy steak. the thick cut is really big and can really fill a hungry stomach. The sides on this dish changes frequently but it is always a hit!Burger - My favorite restaurant burger in the city. the thick grass fed patty is just a perfect pink medium rare. You can choose what cheese you want it topped with but I always go for the bleu cheese with bacon. Served with pickled onions, lettuce, and a brioche bun. The fries have the perfect amount of crispy to it. A must order for any burger lover.Bar - Great selection of local craft beers and whiskey. Ask for a whiskey menu since it is always changing. They usually carry some harder finds from BTAC.

Ohhhhh NOPA!!! As long as I make reservations, we're good. Otherwise, you make me wait too long. Why is it ALWAYS so busy?!?! I know, I know ... the chefs know how to throw down!!! There's always something different on the menu. Staples remain constant, but I like how you switch things up every now and then. You always make me so happy, except for when I have to wait!!! Even sitting at the bar requires an hour long wait if I don't have reservations. Lucky for you, whenever I have a craving but forget to reserve a seat, I'll still stand around and wait my turn.

Came here on a random weekday for happy hour and sat at the communal table! Drinks are cheap & bar bites are available. My favorite were the shishito peppers!We also decided to stay for dinner... 2 friends and I decided to split the Housemade Pappardelle, Warm Goat Cheese w/ Crustini's, and a Lamb Pasta. They were all amazing but my winner was probably the pappardelle, though I have major regrets not trying their burger/fries.... guess that's for next time!

Ressies a must! unless you can eat very late in the night!I have heard so much about NOPA, especially for their brunch. Fortunately, I was able to try them out for a late night dinner, which was perfect for those who get out late from work! I normally don't order porkchops at restaurants for the risk of it being dry but with all the hype, I just had to here! It was delicious and tender. We also ordered their fig and goat cheese, and beignets for dessert. Everything was delicious. Cocktails were all delicious and definitely spirit forward.I loved their spacious venue and high ceilings. Try to get a ressie on their upstairs level so you can enjoy the SF night life from your table.

I have been here multiple times now and what has stayed uniform is the experience. The food always tastes good, the vibe is always fun and the service is excellent. Starting with the drinks, I really like their sunshine fix and strawberry cava, do give it a try if you go here. For appetizers, do not leave without having the warm goat cheese with raspberries and blueberries. You must have read that avacado toast is a must try and yes it's great but nothing that blew my mind. They are pretty generous with avacado which is great but last time I found the bread a lil hard to chew on. For entrees, salmon is definitely a yes and if you do not have any dietary constraints, porchetta or pork pasta is a must try. Alright my vegetarian friends, here is a tip for you. You must have read that vegetarians go not for this place that's because they are ready to make a vegetarian dishe for you specially their pasta. They will put some veggies and make it nice for you. Overall, it's a fun place to be.

Nopa has enough 5 star reviews so I'll keep this short. Amazing ingredients, ridiculous flavors, definitely worth the cost. Get the soft scramble egg or custard French toast if you're going in for brunch. House smoked bacon is delicious, but very greasy and oily. This is definitely a treat-yourself kind of place.

I've heard marvelous things about Nopa's Country PORK CHOP ($32) like how it is almost life changing. True or false, you wonder? Let me just say that was the reason why we booked a table here. For that slab of bone-in meat that you would dare not eat pink elsewhere, we moved around our itinerary to accommodate our reservation. Oh the things we do for food. In this case, the pork chop which rendered lavish amounts of savory juices and astounding flavor was well worth it. It was served quite the handsome portion that sharing might be ideal for many, though I would probably get this all to myself the next time I find my way back in the city. I haven't had pork chop this good, ever. Even the sides of pinto beans, grilled peach, broccoli, and hazelnuts were fantastic, but don't count on getting the same sides because I hear it changes all the time. I also hear it's always good so take comfort in that.Their FLATBREAD ($18) caught my eye from the menu and won over my palate because how can it not when this was topped with bacon, basil, and burrata among other things. A power list of ingredients in my book. That chewy dough, though. SWEET CORN RAVIOLI ($15) was a beautiful surprise emanating a natural sweetness from the corn from every bite and then sealed with a brine from the cured pork loin. I really liked this. It's too bad I can't say the same for the SMOKED TROUT ($17) which was my least favorite of the night and the smallest in portion. The capers may have been the reason as I am not a fan unless paired with salmon. If anything, my dining companions enjoyed this dish so it's probably only a matter of preference.Boasting a bright open floor plan thanks to the colossal glass windows that goes all the way up the high ceiling, the restaurant has a trendy yet casual vibe that's very suitable for San Francisco in my eyes. A sprawling bar, open kitchen, and a second floor seating with a view of the main dining room are other features you'll notice when you walk in here. Since the dishes are served family style, coming in groups of 3 or 4 would be ideal. Don't forget to make reservations in advance though. As you can tell, Nopa is quite the popular culinary destination.

Great atmosphere. Bustling/busy but not too loud. Interior is solid.Duck Legs: The duck just fell off the bone so easily. The corn and the sauce complimented this dish so well. I think you should order this dish.Steak: The steak was a special not on the menu, and it was a bit overcooked. The middle parts were closer to medium-rare as we ordered but most of the steak was medium. It was still a good quality 13 oz steak with great seasoning/sauce.Trout: This dish was amazing - the trout was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the sauce that came with it complimented this really well without making it too fishy.Mussels: A lot of fat juicy mussels. Order this!I don't remember the name of the cocktails I ordered but they were all good. To be honest, I recommend ordering a lot and sharing the dishes - the portions are perfect for sharing.It's sort of pricey but it's SF with really good quality food/service so it's worth it.

I wish I could give this place more stars, Nopa is my go-to place whenever a friend is in town or just always. This place is constantly packed and for a good reason! For starters, it just has a great vibe and the people there are always great. Every time I've gone to Nopa, which is a LOT the people who work there are really nice and super helpful. The ingredients are local, the food is decently sized and priced! The burger is the best, it's cooked to perfection and comes with an amazing sauce. Also, I HIGHLY recommend the desserts they are awesome, even if you're full just get it.

We had a really solid dinner here during our stay in SF -- I was really torn between 4 and 5 stars. We got (in order of how much I liked them):- Pork chop- Burger with gruyere- Pappardelle with bolognese- Broccoli- Olives- Goat cheeseMy wife had them ranked differently -- she preferred the pappardelle over the burger, and loved the goat cheese. (Goat cheese is not really my thing.) That said, we both really liked everything, and the pork chop was a particular standout for both of us. If there was anything holding me back, it was that there are so many places in New York (where we're from) to get great burgers and great bolognese that, while these were great as well, they didn't really stand out from the pack. The pork chop, though, was more unique for us, and executed perfectly.All in though, a really solid SF spot.

Easily made brunch reservations online. Was surprised there was still a line pretty late in the day for brunch. Even with reservations, we still waited another 10 min or so but then were quickly seated. Service was good, beautiful bar. We were seated in a booth near the end of the bar. Menu was small for brunch and we ended up sharing some dishes including the grilled zucchini and walnut bread, quiche and a duck based entree. Food was good and had an interesting take but not excellent. Also, I ordered a glass of raspberry flavored cava and it tasted like cough syrup (should've gone with the normal cava). All in all, my expectations were pretty high since I've been trying to make dinner ressies for a while now and the experience was just average. I'll have to come back for dinner some time since the menu looks more extensive, but for all the hype, brunch here was just meh.

Been here twice and both times have been phenomenal. Be prepared to wait awhile (we waited 1.5 hours or so), but imo it was worth it. Great for small groups where you can order a few things and share them. They change up the menu every so often, and for my most recent visit the curry oven baked egg was the standout in terms of the savoury entrees. The french custard toast was AMAZING as per usual. And thick. I would recommend sharing that one with a friend or two. For me at least a third of it was more than enough.

Made a reservation via OpenTable for a dinner reservation and the earliest available was 31 days out. Parking can be tricky in the Panhandle as it's all street parking with minimal paid lots.Started off with the goat cheese crostinis which were excellent! Crispy crostinis with warm goat cheese along with sweet strawberries and tangerines to complement this appetizer.Moved on to the smoked trout appetizer which was also phenomenal. It was very light and flavorful without being too overpowering!The highlight of the meal was the world-class bone-in pork chop that was very juicy, tender, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. There was no sand paper taste to the huge pork chop. Seating is very comfortable and wasn't pretentious at all. Hostess and waiters all took care of us too!

The reviews are on the money. I had the pork chop with strawberry sauce and broccolini and it was delicious! I did not have any room for dessert and in fact didn't finish my pork chop so you don't have to worry about this place being one of those expensive restaurants that give you a dollop of food and call it a meal.I didn't have a reservation, so I had to wait about 20 - 25 minutes to grab a spot at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and kept me entertained as I was dining solo. The space itself is very big and beautiful - really a great spot to go on a date or just have a super delicious meal.

This review is only based on the drinks and dessert as the visit was after dinner somewhere else.The bar service is exceptional. The crew at the bar and in the kitchen are amazing. The desserts are heavenly. The drinks strong and delicious. The pork chops seem to be a popular dish, and this place is known to be a hangout for chefs, being one of a few places that serves good food late at night.

"Favorite" is not a word I throw around or use lightly, so it means quite a lot when I say that Nopa might be my favorite restaurant in all of SF! The cooking here is creative and perfectly executed, while the ingredients are seasonal, high quality, and absolutely delicious. The restaurant is always crowded, but it's not that hard to get a reservation if you book far enough in advance! On my most recent visit, I came for dinner with a group of four and was blown away by every dish that came to us. We started with the smoked trout with cucumbers, croutons, and horseradish, which was smoky and delicious. The warm goat cheese with crostini was so creamy and irresistible--and I'm normally not even the biggest fan of goat cheese! The fried duck wings were perfectly crispy and so well seasoned underneath the light crust--the bourbon caramel added the perfect, rounded finish!And then came our entrees (the portion sizes here are huge for this kind of a restaurant). One of the specials of the night was the whole grilled rockfish--enough for 2-3 people. It had fantastically crispy skin and came on an absolutely massive plate with artichokes and red potatoes. The burger we ordered was huge and was still quite rare on the inside--definitely appealing to one's carnivorous instincts. But my favorite dish that we tried was definitely the grilled squab, which was served medium rare. The squab breast was one of the most tender, tasty pieces of poultry I've ever tried. The squab was grilled with a delicious, spicy green harissa and was served with artichokes, potatoes, blood orange, and salad greens. The harissa gave all the vegetables a savory, spicy undertone that kept you coming back for more and more. Unbelievable!If you're in the city, you must check this place out! The small dishes are so creatively plated and assembled, the entrees are substantial and cooked to perfection, and everything is simply delicious! I'll definitely be back. Hopefully soon.

A good burger? Yes. San Francisco's best? Absolutely not, especially when the $18 price tag doesn't include cheese or bacon. I saw this Nopa on nearly every top burger list for San Francisco and had to give it a try. We got lucky and found an 8:45pm reservation slot on the same day.There's upstairs and downstairs seating. Downstairs is rather loud with the bar area close by, but we were seated upstairs, which was quite nice. Overall the place had high ceilings and a great ambience from the 2nd floor. We got the burger, a side of roasted broccoli (recommended and included with burger), and the new fresh brioche mini donuts. The burger (3.5/5, $22 with bacon and cheese): It's good! The patty was thick, juicy, and beautifully medium rare. However, when you have a patty this thick, the burger should typically be well seasoned. The burger was barely seasoned and definitely was not popping with flavor by any means. My girlfriend and I both slapped on quite a bit of the spicy mayo, still feeling that other artisan burger joints had better offerings with more flavor. The broccoli (4/5): Pretty damn tasty for broccoli. They put some really interesting seasonings on it and it was quite well roasted on the grill. I was thinking why the heck would I get broccoli at this place, but the server recommended it and it came through. Nothing mind blowing though. The donuts (5/5, $11): This was the star. This is a newer menu item that includes four fresh brioche donuts with two small cups of dipping sauces (I think passion fruit and some cream sauce). Oh man, these were insane. Melt in your mouth, hot off the fryer pillows that ended the meal quite nicely. $11 for fried dough though?Overall, I found the place to be good, but nothing mind blowing. I probably wouldn't come back because I find it all to be rather overpriced. $62 before tip for 2 burgers and an order of donuts... plus they add on an extra couple of bucks for "employee benefits", which I HATE. Hence the 3 stars. Raise your food prices if you're too cheap to pay for the healthcare bill, don't just bait and switch me by adding it onto the check. You're making plenty markup anyway on your $22 burgers.

Tasty food, a little bit on the more pricier side, but I guess it's comparable to most other SF restaurants with $$$. We had a wonderful meal with great service. I would definitely come back as I hear their menu changes regularly and they always have new dishes to try. We had the:- smoked beef brisket - yummay... almost tasted like pastrami- calamari - interesting take with the whole calamari on top of thick bread- porkchop - a must try- halibut - could have passed on- vegetable tangine - good veggie option- salted maple burbon semifreddo dessert - delicious sorbet!- blueberry shaved ice - was ok, the basil ice cream was a little funky

So flavorful. All the meats were fantastic and I'm typically super picky about meat. Loved the Shel Silverstein inspired cocktail menu. The Giving Tree and The Missing Piece were my favorite. Would love to try Where the Sidewalk Ends next time.Easily one of the best food experiences of my life. It was actually difficult walking out of there--partially from being tipsy, from wanting to keep eating, and from being so overwhelmed with everything.12/10 worth every damn cent + calorie.

Came here for the brunch and expected a really long wait. Our group of four would have waited maybe an hour but we decided to go to the joint family table to eat and get seated immediately which is nice. We tried a few dishes including French toast but I got the eggs with a salad which was quite basic. I tried and enjoyed the burger and fries. Their lunch menu is quite limited but tons of people go here. Dinner looks legit so would be nice to try some of those entrees.

Finally made it to NOPA and was totally impressed. I love the atmosphere here with very high ceilings, large windows and a comfortable, open feel. I think it would be a great third date restaurant. We reserved a month in advance for a group of eight and I'd say one of the major benefits is that they don't make you do a prix fixe menu for a large party which a lot of restaurants require. This allowed all of us to have exactly what we wanted which is always a bonusOur waitress was really friendly and made great recommendations about the food and the wine. When we asked what the standout is she said that she comes to the restaurant on her off days to order the burger...that's a pretty big sell. I can't imagine ever going into my office on my day off so I took her word for it and ordered the burger. What we got: For the table we shared the brussel sprouts with balsamic reduction and pomegranite seeds. You haven't had brussels until you've had them here. They were OUTSTANDING....and that's a vegetable I'm talking about. We ordered two but I wish we had gotten a third!We also had the flatbread which was a great thing to share, the wood baked butter beans which were delicious and also good for sharing and the cauliflower which was packed with flavor and very different. Everyone at the table split entrees, I split the burger and the roast chicken. We added cheddar cheese to the burger but I wouldn't go too nuts on the toppings because it's the meat that really shines. I don't know how they cook it so perfectly medium rare or get the texture so perfect, but they do and it's amazing. We also split the roast chicken and the only reason why I didn't give NOPA five stars is because of this. It was good, definitely good. But a little dry and lacking in flavor. I'd rather order this from Limon if I had the option. I also don't remember a ton of vegetarian options on the entree side of the menu which could be a problem for some (but there are tons of veggie small plates)For dessert, we split the cream cheese donuts which were exceptional and we should have gotten two orders for the eight of us. They were piping hot and totally unique. WE also had the warm ginger cake and the huckleberry panna cotta which was tart and sweet and a fun twist on the traditional one. Looking forward to coming back for brunch!

I keep hearing good things about this place and I was excited to try it. I was a little concerned about the wait as I heard it was really popular, but we must have gotten super lucky as we got seated almost right away. I think the same party size bailed on their reservation or something and we were able to snag the table. I love the atmosphere of this place. It's so open and nicely decorated. I got the burger as I heard it was really good here and we also go the pappardelle. The burger was amazing. The beef was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I was really happy with my choice. The pappardelle was really good as well. We kept asking for cheese and they kept giving us fresh Parmesan which we loved. The pasta was cooked well and the Bolognese was very tasty. I also had a bite of the pork chop and was surprised that it was super juicy, tender and flavorful. My biggest fear with pork is that it's going to be too dry, but this was perfect.Overall, it was a great meal with great company at a great place.

The food is 5 stars every time. The rotisserie herbed chicken, pork chops, and burger are all indescribably incredible. There's a reason the wait is always so long.

This was the one restaurant that I've been dying to go to since I moved to sf in aug and am so happy I finally got to dine here.Reservation only opens a month in advance. We got a table for 7pm but got here super early at 630pm and they seated us right away.We got a corner table upstairs which gives us an amazing view of downstairs and the kitchen. I love open space restaurants. Service was top notch....it was fast and efficient. Our server was knowledgeable with what's on the menu and gave us some great recommendations. The menu changes from time to time so what you see on yelp might not be there anymore. But the one item that's been on their menu since the opening of the restaurant 10 years ago is the wovod baked butter beans, so or course we had to get it and it was amazing!! I don't even like beans but these were sweet and delicious. Also got the baked Farro with goat cheese....also a great dish.The wood grilled hamburger was so good. One of the best I've ever had. The pattie was so juicy. Loved the aioli sauce as well. The house made papperella was amazing! This was my favorite. The fennel susuage was yummy and it has a sweet flavor to it from the butter squash. Who knew butter squash would be so goood!! The pasta is super fresh...it was cooked for like 10 hours. Cannot wait to come back for brunch. I've returned for brunch and another dinner date here., recently. Seriously, love this place so much and it is my top 5 places in sf!! Service is always top notch here. Our party of 5 arrived 15 mins before our reservation and we got seated right away. Tried the herbed chicken this time....it was literally a whole chicken! Such a big meal...chicken was soft and moist. Loved every bite of it. Their brunch is amazing too!!!!

Literally everyone who's anyone (and even everyone who's not anyone) in SF has told me I have to eat at Nopa. Usually when that many people talk up a place it turns out to be a massive disappointment. I went into Nopa with the thought that surely it couldn't be as good as everyone said it was. I stand corrected. Everything from start to finish was amazing, and if I ever get to go back again (let's face it, getting a reservation here is kinda like winning the lottery) I'm going to make sure I don't wear tight pants so I can eat even more food.My group opted to share all of our dishes which is the way to go here if you want to experience all of the awesomeness there.We started with a mix of apps- the warm goat cheese with pomegranate seeds and crostini, flatbread with bacon and olives, fried brussel sprouts with bourbon date caramel and pecans, and avocado toast with jalapeno. Our waitress must have heard us talking about the trout dish so mistakenly brought us one, but was quick to remove it from the bill as we didn't actually order it (although we were happy to eat it, we really appreciated this level of service!!)Let's talk about the brussel sprouts. And how you need these in your life immediately- and how you'll wonder how a brussel sprout can be so delicious (the answer of course is due to the sweetness from the bourbon date caramel, the fact they are fried and that there are salted pecans). I'm not even going to attempt to recreate these at home because there's no way I'll ever capture the awesomeness of these.The avocado toast was also stellar. We felt the goat cheese dish, while also good, lacked pizzazz. It's basically just a warm cup of goat cheese with a few pomegranate seeds and toasted bread, so nothing out of this world, but still good.After the apps we moved on to the porkchop and the burger. At this point we were already stuffed, but when you've got such amazing food in front of you you just keep going. The porkchop has roasted grapes which provide a really interesting and awesome 'pop' to the dish and the burger sadly is one of the best in the city. I say sadly because it's so hard to get a reservation here, so it's unlikely you could make this part of the normal rotation.Just a note that corkage has recently gone up from $20 to $30 a bottle- we called ahead to see what corkage would be and were told $20, so they honored this price, but just a note if you're thinking about bringing in your own wine.

Came here for an outing with coworkers. We got a full 3 hour meal trying about 8-9 dishes. We were lucky that the Company footed the bill.I'd highly recommend the restaurant as everything I tried was amazing! I'd recommend everything I had that night, but these were some of the highlights or must-haves if you will:*Goat cheese and berry combo with crostini*Oh so delectable! The crostini was so crunchy and the goat cheese went surprisingly well with the tart berries. Definitely get as an appetizer.*Flatbread of sausage, basil, spring onions, mozzarella, and zucchiniIt tastes as delicious as it sounds. You just can't go wrong with any combination of the ingredients listed above. Definitely get.*Moroccan vegetable tagine*Didn't expect what this would taste like going in, but it was absolutely delicious. I think it's vegan too? In case you are wondering apparently tagine is a dish and also a type of Earthenware pot that the dish is cooked in. Unfortunately the dish wasn't served on this type of pot, but it was very refreshing. There is quite a bit of nuts, tomatoes, chickpeas, and cauliflower in the dish. It's got a curry like texture and tastes a little tart. *Country Pork chop*Possibly one of the best cooked pork chops I've had. Perfect combination of lean and fatty chewy pieces. Not over cooked as you typically see in restaurants. It's perfectly done, cooked like a good steak. Absolutely worth getting.For cocktails try the strawberry cava and get a nice pic with the drink. It was an excellent meal and some how the large amount of nuts/fruits/veggies used in the dishes convinced me that I had a delicious and semi-guilt free meal. I will be back!

Amazing. Came here for brunch, had reservation, Sunday a.m. place was packed. Our table was upstairs which was great because the restaurant is gorgeous and you can see it all from up there.As for brunch food, we shared their sourdough bread (unbelievable), and the baked eggs, and the smoked lamb shoulder. The extra bread is needed because you will want to soak up every drop of that delicious eggs dish. The lamb wasn't gammy at all and quite a good brunch food. We also had some mimosas. Service was excellent.

Decent food. The burger was tasty and juicy - but not as good as homemade. The fries were good, too - they taste exactly like In-n-Out Burger's (but cost several times more). The dessert was excellent: Blueberry Shaved Ice with Basil Ice Cream and some other stuff. All in all a burger, fries, ice cream and a Diet Coke cost $40 plus tip which is pretty obscene. They have a ridiculous system: there's a bar and a communal table for walk-in customers. The staff checked and told me some people were just finishing dessert and that I should stake out my seat by standing lurking right behind them to wait until they left. Really. That's their actual system. Other people were doing it, too. Very awkward for the seated customers and for the lurkers.Also, the staff was an issue. Being warm and friendly is clearly not a cool thing there but they have to try to be somewhat polite, I guess. It results in uneasy interactions. It's not a welcoming environment.I was starving so I stayed and ate but I wouldn't choose to go there again.

What an excellent dinner!! That's open late!!So you have your choice of Popeye's chicken or the infallible Nopa. To be honest, you can't go wrong ;)Came here with a reservation for a birthday dinner! Got lucky with parking and headed right in. We excitedly discussed the menu, and placed our orders. Super nice server, and really great ambiance inside. On to the food!Avocado Toast- really delicious! have to say Rich Table's grilled avocado really raised the bar but wouldn't mind having this every week either ;)Flatbread of bacon, spinach, maitake mushrooms, thyme and Gruyere- not sure if ravenous or amazing. this was gone in seconds.Country Pork Chop- super tender and juicy! if you're a fan of pork, this is a must-get!Pappardelle- the table didn't like this, so I finished instead haha. Really great potatoes and stew-like taste.Rotisserie Herbed Chicken- pretty tender, only tried a bit of it so can't say too much. The waiter said this was pretty popular though.Grilled New York Steak- Really loved this! Steak was delicious, and the mushroom puree was amazing! I would totally get this again!Overall, Nopa stood true to its name as a SF staple. Extraordinary food, great experience, and a night to remember!

While the pork chop is what I fantasised about when booking (It'd been about 7 years since I had it last), the other dishes we had really amazed me.The bean appetizer with hazelnuts was dynamic in color, texture and presentation. The hazelnuts are candied (or something like that) and make the whole dish pop.The standout shocker was the simple tagliatelle bolognese. Normally I wouldn't order such a home-style, old world standard at a nice restaurant. But I saw our neighboring table's dish and had to order it. Sublime. Absolutely perfect.Service was attentive, but not annoying; friendly, fun and casual while still maintaining absolute professionalismBravo!!Be warned: this place has some acoustic issues and is quite noisy.Show less

I went here with my friend who works in the kitchen so we got special treatment and were able to sample so many items on the menu. Everything is so good!The burger was amazing, both my friends got rabbit which they loved. Also our friend who works there ordered a pasta dish and it didn't sound like anything special, but holy crap- one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Also we got to sample multiple desserts and I HAVE to say, you will not go wrong with any dessert options here. I want to go back so badly.

We picked Nopa for our last meal during our short stay in San Francisco. I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and was limited on time options so I definitely recommend calling at least 2 weeks in advance. This is a very attractive restaurant just a block or so from Alamo Square. Its a little unassuming from the outside. We dined on a Sunday evening and it was packed. The cocktail menu is impressive and sophisticated. We ordered the beef brisket and olives as apps. My husband loved the brisket and I loved the olives. I ordered the pappardelle and it was GREAT. The Bolognese was as good as any that I've ever had (I'm a pasta junky and have had my fair share of authentic Bolognese). My husband had the duck, he really liked it and it presented very well. Service was unremarkable and very professional. Priced right. Solid 5 stars.

People rave about this place, and I get it- the food is really good, the concept is clean california/classic food, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. However, the food just isn't THAT great. It's kind of american classics themed, which is great, but I honestly don't see the hype. I went on a Tuesday and was sat upstairs which is really nice and quieter than the downstairs area, got the chicken. It was okay. Beautiful space though, fun for dates :)

I was looking for a quick bite to eat after seeing Puddles Pity Party the Independent. Yelp showed me pizza spots, a place for burgers, and then there was Nopa.My girlfriend and I went there a half before they closed. Nopa has a cool modern atmosphere and interior. It's very open and relaxed.My eyes bulge when I noticed warm goat cheese with blueberries, strawberries and crostini was one the menu. And Nopa did not disappoint. The goat cheese was soft and buttery. It had a slight tans but wasn't as tart as I expected. The berries were all really soft and sweet. We ran out of crostini about half through the goat cheese...really we were saying the goat cheese for the carrots.I think it's really fun to try the vegetables side dishes restaurants prepare. It helps me think how I can up my own veggie game at home. We decided to order the carrots. They came with dates and a dance with harissa -there is a cool NYT poem about hummus dancing with harrisa.The carrots were bold. A little spicy too, and perfect to dip onto the goat cheese . We were that hungry, but we cleared those plates.Also the water was served at room temperature. And I loved it. I was kicking back glass after glass with out my freezing.I wish I had room to try the pork chop that helpers keep mentioning is great. I guess I have another reason to go back to Nopa.

I've been to Nopa about eight times. It's cool how they don't have signage outside and stay somewhat low key in a hipster neighborhood. Their pork chop for dinner is great and their French toast is to die for during brunch. Secret tip is that their Bloody Mary's at the bar is really nice too. Not all chunky like most places and they serve it with a nice touch of yellow beets. Classy place for classy people.

This restaurant is a great place to have somewhat fancy or fancier food and place with your family/partner/friend/business partner. etc (pretty much everyone)My girl friend was so excited to visit this restaurant so we booked the seats at least more than a month before. Although we were late for the time we booked on the day, they were pretty flexible with it and they let us in :D So I was pretty happy with their customer service :D The food was pretty good too! I heard that they sometimes change the menu so although you visit couple times you'll not going to be bored! I had burger and it was so juicy and the bread was so tasty! I definitely recommend it!

With over 4k stellar reviews there is no question they serve exceptional food. A friend and I were in the neighborhood and we stopped in at 7:30 pm. We knew Nopa was going to be packed but was going to try and get a seat at the bar or the large communal table. It was 3 deep at the bar but we scoped out a couple finishing up at the communal table. We ordered and shared the following dishes:Smoked Trout was superb served with some fresh greens 5 stars Flatbread. Was like a light airy very thin crust sausage pizza 5 starsParphadelle Pasta with a meat sauce was good but the pasta was stuck together 4 starsLong Cod served on a bed of beans was good a little on the bland side 4 starsService was good. Parking around the restaurant very challenging but because we were able to get a space a block up the street we decided to walk in to Nopa. The noise level makes it hard to have a conversation with the person next to you never mind across the table. There is some additional weird background musical beat.

I highly suggest getting their early to put your name down. I think when I went we put our name down half an hour before they officially opened and their was already a line wrapping around the building. The wait was worth in in the end. Get the bacon

This is the BEST restaurant that my wife and I ate at while in San Francisco. Seriously, I cannot give them enough praise. My wife and I happened upon Nopa after getting up and walking out of another restaurant that we had reservations at because service was so horrible. We came into Nopa around 9pm and starving from sight seeing all day. The staff got us seated as quickly as possible and the rest of the night was perfect. Chandler was our server, and she was top-notch. I guess the word got around that we had a bad experience at our previous restaurant, so the whole crew was taking care of us. The Chef came over at one point and congratulated us on our 3 year wedding anniversary!We felt at home here. It reminded us of our favorite restaurant back in Atlanta. When we return to this beautiful city, we will DEFINITELY be back!

Gotta make sure we hit up Nopa when we're in the bay. For starters, even for the non sardine eaters, you gotta get the appetizer fried sardines... yes they are whole sardines, and not the salty slivers of fish that you're thinking of on a pizza. Make sure someone at your table orders the pork chop to share with; that's a must! When I was there recently they had a limited 3 pound ribeye. We debated ordering 2 of them but our waiter convinced us otherwise and I think that angered my 6 foot+, 250lb+ carnivore Chinese homie.... "WHAT you don't think I can eat 3 pounds of beef!!". It was seriously a lot of great tasting ribeye!

We had reservations at Nopa on Saturday at around 9PM. It was about a month's wait time on getting any reservations and they filled up very quickly. When we arrived at around 8:50PM they already had our table ready and sat us right away.The atmosphere and ambience was nice. It was crowded and you could hear the hum of conversation all around. Everyone looked happy and like they were having a great time.We sat down and were looking at their beer and wine selection and asked for a recommendation from our server, who we later found out was the manager. She suggested this nice dry white wine and I ordered a draft IPA. Both drinks were delicious and paired well with our meal.We placed our order with our actual server. We ordered the Fried Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Almond Squash, Country Pork Chops, and Duck.Fried Brussels Sprouts - They were fried perfectly and had just a slight bitterness to it. The persimmons and almonds were a great touch and added a nice sweetness and earthiness to the dish. The sauce was just the right amount.Roasted Almond Squash - The squash was cooked al dente and had a nice ripeness and sweetness to it.Country Pork Chops - The pork chop was great. It was tender and flavorful. The sear was good on the top side, but the underside was not cooked the same.Duck - The duck was cooked beautifully and had a great flavor to it. When we were eating it, it felt like we kept discovering new flavor profiles and items in the dish even though we knew what was in it.Overall I would highly recommend Nopa. Just plan ahead and make your reservations as early as possible.

Surprisingly the food was good but not worth the hype. I enjoyed my food but not sure I would pine to go again. Waitress was nice. I had the tagliatelle, others had bucatini and the duck breast. Overall the food was enjoyable but nothing to get overly excited about. Perhaps my expectations have shifted and good food is expected but great food becomes noteworthy. Recommend going if you have never been.

A waited up until midnight to book a Friday reservation a month in advance and I am so glad he did. I have wanted to try NOPA since I moved to SF and was thrilled to get the chance to go. We arrived, a month after making the reservation, ready for a classic date night and were sat upstairs with a view looking over into the kitchen.The restaurant itself is beautiful and pretty large with a bustling crowd and full arsenal of wait staff. I loved the table we had as we got to watch the chefs work their magic and to view all of the dishes coming out before we placed our own order. We didn't order any drinks or appetizers (next time). While the menu has changed since we went and I don't remember the EXACT details of we had, we did order:-Roasted Duck: This was mine and it was DELICIOUS. The duck was cooked perfectly and it came with a duck wing which I ate with my fingers like a barbarian. I will say, I was still pretty hungry after I demolished this. Definitely should have ordered an appetizer, especially in light of the fact that Nopa doesn't give you ANYTHING to eat while you're waiting for your food (more on this later).-Pork Chop: This was A's and it was delicious, as many reviewers have pointed out. This seems to be a classic dish and there were so many orders of this coming out of the kitchen. This was cheaper than mine and by contrast, huge. Luckily I was able to steal some of A's after I inhaled my plate.Being still hungry, I wanted dessert so we ordered the Chocolate Ganache Tart which came with blood orange sherbet. This tart was DELICIOUS and all of the flavors and textures worked so well together. I was not disappointed by this at all and would HIGHLY recommend saving room for dessert just to try this.Overall, I thought the service at Nopa was pretty good. Our waters were refilled constantly and I felt like our server was very attentive. One thing I didn't love is that our server told us our food would be out soon after we had waited 20 minutes only for it to be another 40 minutes. Yes, we waited an hour for our food which is a long time but I still think the worst part was being told our food was going to come up. Then, to add insult to injury, she said that she was glad the kitchen was so fast in getting our food out. Like, what? Does not compute. I do think an hour is a while by most restaurants' standards so its a bit alarming when your server thinks that is fast....Also, I don't understand why a place that charges more than $30 a plate doesn't serve even bread to start, especially in light of the wait. That's insane. I get that restaurants want you to order an appetizer but this just seems cheap.You know what isn't cheap, though? Dinner at Nopa. For 2 entrees and 1 dessert, we paid $100 with tax and tip. I am not saying this is unreasonable, but I think the value isn't there especially since I really feel like we should have ordered an appetizer to begin with which would have jacked the bill up more. Will we come back? Yes, we have reservations upcoming specifically to try the $18 burger. I even think we will be back for a nice dinner at some point, but with more realistic expectations of this being a splurge rather than a normal weekend dinner. Everything was delicious but definitely be aware that this will be an expensive, long meal.

This place is great! I've been here for both brunch and dinner and had a good experience both times, but my review will be for brunch.Reservations for brunch can be a bit difficult... especially if you're looking for a prime time Saturday or Sunday morning and can imagine the wait being gruesome without a reservation.Unlike your typical brunch place, Nopa has a bit more sophistication to it and more comfortable. It's a lot more spacious and we didn't feel rushed to finish our food for the next party waiting.The brioche french toast most definitely stole the show. If I ever went back I would definitely get 2 orders of that and be good to go. When it came out it was still warm from the oven and biting into it felt like I was eating a piece of heaven. Not too sweet, but sweet enough to keep me going back for more. The texture was perfect, every bite was soft with a little crunch on the outside, but the inside still had a lot of substance in it and I didn't feel like I was just eating a bunch of air. We also got a sauerkraut/sausage and a cooked salmon lox bagel dish which were both good, but nothing extraordinary. Just order the brioche.

Came here for on a special occasion on a lazy Monday and had a seat at the bar. I watched intently at the drinks the bartender was making, and asked the bartender a few questions about his craft. I actually learned a whole lot about the different glass shapes, and which ones are used for what kinds of alcohol, so it was not only a good dinner, but somewhat educational as well haha. Anyways, on to the food! I had my heart set on the pork chop since the day before. Of course, I had my reservations (nothing on Nopa), but I think I (well, my whole family) has been a bit scarred from my mom's super dry (and hard) pork chop (sorry mom :P), which is probably why she stopped making it when we complained enough, and why I (and pretty much everybody in my family) never orders pork chop at restaurants lol. But! I thought I should give Nopa's pork chop a try, considering all the rave reviews about it.- Pork chop: so so so delicious! It was super moist, so much so that it didn't even feel like pork chop. The side of greens was also a delightful accompaniment. Hazelnuts and super mini blueberries gave it a very earthy flavour and a bit of sweetness, while the horseradish provided that well-needed amount of acidity to balance the whole dish perfectly. When describing the meal to a friend, she joked that it sounded like I was a caveman, eating a big hunk of meat and gathering all the items necessary (nuts, berries, leaves) for my very earthy meal XD The only thing was that it was a bit raw near the bone, but besides that, it was super delicious and definitely the best pork chop I've ever had. Recommendations don't lie, and the pork chop is definitely a must-try. Definitely a great dinner :)

Nopa is good, but.... The service is excellent, the atmosphere is chic, the food is wonderful, the cocktails are great... here comes the "but...": This is one of those hip SF restaurants that is impossible to get into. My boyfriend and I tried to get a seat at the community table on three separate occasions and gave up because the wait is not managed. You have no idea how long you're going to wait, and there's no sense of order, so you can't tell if you're gonna have to fight someone to get the seat you've been eyeballing for the past 45 minutes. I got increasingly stressed out as time went on, so we gave up and left. Not my ideal experience, especially if I'm about to drop some serious dough on my dinner. Even getting reservations was a hassle. To get a Friday night reservation, I had to book at 6:30am exactly 1 month in advance! And by then, all the tables were already booked between 7 and 8pm! By the time we actually got to try Nopa, we felt put off just by how much work we had to do to eat there and give them our money.Don't get me wrong... Nopa is great, and we had a great experience. But you can undoubtedly find food that is equally good, if not better, without having to fight the hype machine to get a seat at the table.
