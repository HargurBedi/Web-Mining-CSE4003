The burgers and shakes here are absolutely amazing.My go to favorite it The Bomb Burger. It is an amazing take on a chili burger. The chili is made fresh every day and the meat that is used is the same meat they use for their burgers. It is very hearty and it sticks to your ribs.Their chocolate peanut butter and their peanut butter banana shakes are just to die for. They are thick and add a nice touch to the burger.I love the fact that you can order fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries or a mixture of fries (regular or sweet) and onion rings.I am a huge lover of dill pickles and the fact that they have them out for unlimited consumption either while you wait, Tom go long with your meal or even to snag a bunch to go with your meal is amazing.Every time I am in San Francisco this is one of my main go to spots and while some say why go to SF for a burger I say why not.

The burgers here are well worth the hype!The mushroom burger is one of the juiciest burgers I have had in the past five years and they do not skimp out on the toppings! Mushroom overload, anyone? I want to try out their other burgers and compare them to one & other. The spries are also fantastic, you can tell the onion rings are fresh cut and fried. The staff is friendly and try to help first timers with any questions. The only thing I didn't like about here is they are a cash-only establishment. It doesn't really make sense when your burgers are more than $10 each and a side of fried stuff ranges from five to seven dollars. This place isn't exactly cheap. If you do come out here for a burger, make sure you bring a hearty appetite and cash!

Stopped here for lunch on Friday about noon. We picked it based on yelp reviews and it's proximity to our hotel. It is is a very small place with about 15 or so seats with a few tables and some counter seating. They only take cash but you can order online and pay with a card or use the ATM they have inside.We checked out the menu, placed our orders at the counter and had a seat. The place really filled up while we were there. They even had people waiting for to go orders. I ordered the mini (1/4 lb) BBQ burger (burger, bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce and grilled onions on a bun). My wife ordered the mini bacon cheese burger. We also had an order of half onion rings and half fries. Our order was delivered to our table rather quickly.The food was good, the service was good, the place was small. This place is solid for burgers.

Pearls is a secret wonder. I remember stopping in here randomly years ago on a SF adventure and calling it a hidden gem because it was so affordable and filling and fast. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it again... until now. It has the best and cheapest sweet potato fries. And regular fries. And burgers. Everything tastes like gourmet fast food because it's nice and greasy and filling, but so much tastier than any fast food chain. Be warned, it's cash only. They only offer tiny water cups so if you're really thirsty just order a water. They have a variety of burger and meal options. There's not much seating inside, so if you have a group you'll have to order it to go. You don't have to wait long because service is fast and direct. It's not a place to really have a sit down meal but if you're insanely hungry or in a rush, it's worth checking out!

CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM.Ambience: Small burger joint. Nothing fancy from the outside, a little hard to spot. Inside, there are only a few tables so it can get crowded pretty quick.Food: BOMB! I got the mushroom burger which was super juicy. My girlfriend got the mini deluxe with cheese, which is a 1/4 lb patty, so still a pretty good size. We also got frings, a combo of onion rings and french fries. It was nice and crunchy but got way more fries than rings.Service: Really chill, nice people working there. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you.Parking: We went on a Saturday night so street parking was really tough. We found a parking structure at the next street over for $4/hr. I would come again and recommend to others.

I was excited to try this place. The proximity to our hotel (across the street!) and the great Yelp reviews convinced my husband and myself to try their burgers. The restaurant itself is small, with very limited seating. The ordering process was easy. Cash only, but there's an ATM in the small restaurant. The server that helped us could have been a little bit friendlier--smile every now and then, girl! My husband ordered the Bula burger (bacon, spicy pineapple, bbq sauce, jack cheese, mayo) and I ordered the Prized Pearl (bacon, bleu cheese, grilled onion, mayo). We shared a fries/onion rings half/half and a chocolate shake.Verdict: - Bula Burger: the bbq sauce overpowered the overall taste of the burger. My husband said he didn't taste the spiciness in the pineapple. Patty was cooked as described by the server (I believe medium rare, closer to pink than red?). However, the burger patty was not seasoned enough. There was an overall lack of flavor the entire burger due to the lack of seasoning. - Prized Pearl: I was incredibly disappointed with this burger. Now, I love grilled onions...but man, this burger was just overwhelmed by the grilled onions. To make matters worse, the onions were grilled in so much oil--which was transferred onto the burger itself. Basically, all I tasted was greasy grilled onions and not much else. There wasn't enough bleu cheese in the burger to cut the greasiness and overpowering onions. And similar to my husband's burger patty, the meat in my burger was very underseasoned and didn't taste like anything. - Fries/Onion rings: decent. Both items were fried to crispy yumminess. A bit greasy, but it's fried food so that's expected. - Chocolate shake: meh. Thick milkshake upon first sip, but eventually loses thickness way too quickly. Midway through, the shake just tasted like a somewhat thick Nesquick. Overall, we were underwhelmed by our experience here. I had high hopes, but they were not met. Maybe it was an off afternoon (that happens, right?). During our next visit to San Fran, we'll probably give it another shot.

Searching for a good burger in the city and we came across this place. It looked promising until I encountered the female taking my order. I ordered two water bottles but when realizing it would be an extra $6 I asked for the free water instead. Then another of her eye rolls occurred after I asked if we could have our burger cut. Oh gee, I'm sorry I only remembered just after I paid...I'm sorry you had to walk ten feet back and ask the chef to cut my burger (I was sharing with my husband). Rang us up for $11 for our burger, which came after the people in front of us and about five more people after us had ordered. Burger was good but are you serious?! $11 for the burger alone and no fries and served with attitude?! Maybe in the future you should consider spitting in my burger or secretly telling me to go f* myself after I pay and turn around to sit down instead allowing me to be privy (to my face) to your childish eye rolls.

This place was good but not great. I came during an off-time, so perhaps that contributed. Staff was nice. I ordered the Spicy Sly with Wagyu patty upgrade, which I don't think is really worth it. One order of fries is more than enough to share with 2 (maybe even 3) people. I ended up giving my leftover fries to a homeless person. I'd come back for lunch to give it another try, though.

First time at Pearl's Deluxe Burgers today and it was an AMAZING EXPERIENCE! So let's get into the nitty gritty. Pearl's is a small establishment with limited seating. It's also a "cash only" business but, there is an ATM located conveniently inside next to the register. There are several luxury or deluxe takes on classic American burgers. Also, there are some recommended burgers as well. I had the Spicy Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Sweet Potato Fries. It was GLORIOUS!! The owner was manning the cash register, provided his favorites and brought the food to our table. The inside reminds me of classic Americana - old Pepsi and coke signage and chalk hand written colorful menu. This is a MUST TRY for anyone who likes burgers and fries

This place is super casual. CASH ONLY. Order your food at the counter and then find a seat at one of the elusive 4 tables.I ordered the bula burger and split the onion rings and garlic fries with 2 others.The bula burger was soooo good. The spicy pineapple is actually blended into the sauce and the burger is smothered in this delicious sauce. A good burger always has a well cooked patty and it didn't disappoint. The juicy, large patty paired well with the jack cheese and bacon.The fries are quite crispy and fried to perfection. The garlic fries have a very potent garlic flavor and the onions were also fried. The onion rings have a good ratio of batter to onion. The fries are a little greasy, but not too the point where it drips verywhere. If I'm looking for a solid burger with fries, I'll be back.

This is my absolute favorite burger place in the Bay Area. After our most recent trek up the steep sidewalks of Post St. I decided on the pesto burger and a side of frings (half-fries, half-onion rings). Never have been disappointed with any of their burgers, and appreciate getting to choose how well you want it cooked. The fries have that extra crunch factor that chain fast food restaurants just can't replicate. Don't forget to bring your cash with you- cash only! My only wish is that they had more seating space because during busy hours you're often nudging elbows with people.

For starters, I did not know about this place, even though I've been living in SF for a few years now. I walked here from Powell station.. WORTH THE WALK! After a few blocks in the TL, going up hills (note, multiple hills), I ordered one of the best burgers I've had in a long time! Got the phat bob, a BBQ burger, w/o bacon, sub veggie patty. Cashier offered to sub another topping like avocado or mushroom since I didn't want the bacon! EPIC. Burger was GREAT. Big, messy, filling, delicious!!Onion rings were slim and crispy, not a bite without the breading, fries were good, ranch was bomb..I will definitely be coming back! Only things to keep in mind, minimal seating, cash only!LASTLY BUT STILL VERY IMPORTANT, if you're visiting sf from out of town and planning to walk here from downtown area... do not go at night! Get yourself a Lyft and you'll thank me later.

Although a little dicey, the prices can't be beat compared to the $15 per burger place down the street. Easily one of the best burgers in SF, if not the Bay Area. Super generous portions for $10 with high quality toppings. We also had the half onion rings and garlic fries which were awesome. The chocolate shake was also amazing. So glad we found this place. I even recommend a special trip...It's that good. Don't let the neighborhood or the dingy exterior fool you.

OH MAN OH MAN. This place has been on my bookmarks more or less since I've started Yelping and I finally got the chance to try it out after running the SF Half Marathon. Needless to say, I had a ravenous appetite and a juicy burger was just the kind of thing I needed. This place is small..but packed. Our group of 7 had to wait awhile to get seated but it was well worth the wait. The menu is crazy extensive. There probably was a list of 10 or so "special burgers" as well as regular burgers, vegetarian burgers, Kobe burgers, grilled cheeses, and hot dogs. In addition, there was also a large variety of sides and shakes as well. Be aware that is cash only, but I do believe there was an ATM inside. Upon suggestion of someone who's been there before, I ordered a Phat Bob and a side of garlic fries for something around ~$14-16 (I forget). Not the cheapest, but I figured I just ran 13.1 miles and I might as well treat myself. Little did I know that this thing would be massive. Like two meals worth massive. That, or I have a tiny tummy. Could be both. Anyway, the Phat Bob was seriously P H A T. It was loaded with thick cut bacon, perfectly crispy onion rings, and bomb bbq sauce. By no means were they stingy on any of the ingredients. Even the side of garlic fries was surprisingly huge. They both were so filling that I could only get myself to finish half of it. I ate the other half a few hours later and it was just as great even then.All in all, I'm super stoked to have finally tried this. Will definitely make the 0.6 mile trek out from the Powell BART station next time in the area. Can't wait to try all the other special burgers!

Amazing burgers! This is one of my favorite burger places in San Francisco. There's pretty limited seated inside so you might have to order to go or wait a bit for one of the few tables to clear up. Service was fast and friendly.I got the deluxe 1/2 lb burger with cheese (~$9) and my fiance got the 1/2 lb phat bob ($11) which had jack cheese, bacon, onion rings, and generous amounts of BBQ sauce. The beef patty was juicy and perfectly cooked. I'm obsessed with the frings ($6.50) here. They are so crispy and addicting especially the onion rings. Prices are very reasonable given how full you will be afterwards.Definitely a must try in the city if you love burgers.

Thanks to Pearl's Burgers I have a new hole in the wall joint to go to.You know how my big thing is customer service + good food = five stars right?Well this place brings it.Came her with my buddy because we were craving burgers and the burgers were high quality, fresh vegetables (like lettuce, homemade pickles, and tomatoes) toasted bun and killer onion rings and okay fries.All hand breaded but we liked the onion rings better.What was truly a winner was the customer service. So, I'm lactose intolerant, not a serious case, but serious enough to get sick if I consume a lot of milk. The owner made sure to make the banana shake lactose free where I was fine that day and the next. He kept his word and the shake was delicious.Two medium rare burgers. Great bacon, Great cheese. Small hole in the wall burger joint.Support your local business and go here if you're in the neighborhood.

3 stars...This place specializes in burgers, and they get it right!I ordered the mushroom burger, medium. Though it came out slightly overcooked it still had plenty of grease to make it memorable.My wife ordered the prized pearl and liked it so much she was reluctant to share. Grilled onions were a bit undercooked for me, but this is a whole mess of blue cheesey goodness!We opted for the "frings"... the fries were great(lightly battered) but the rings were a bit flimsy... a bit more breading would help them to be more sturdy to hold the onion.The shake machine was broken so we will go elsewhere in search of dessert..though this is a cash only joint, and I'm not sure I had enough moolah on me to cover a couple of their shakes.Ambiance is OK Corral meets kebab shop, service was prompt, and prices are in line for the area, though slightly higher than expectation.With so many options this joint just did not make enough of an impression to make the list, but good none-the-less.

After ordering online, I went to pick up my burger and fries. I was really excited to eat a delicious burger from Pearl's, but once I picked it up and cut it in half back at my office, I found PUBIC HAIR between the burger and the cheese. There is apparently a 100% health rating, but pulling the hair out of my burger makes me question that.Going back to Pearl's to talk to the cashier, he only comped me the burger, and refused to give me the contact info for the owner. I work in the service industry and service like that is not helpful, nor eases my mind of what should be great service and food, but lacks in quality. Do not eat at Pearls Deluxe Burgers.

What you've been missing all your life. If you ever try this place, close your eyes, choose a burger and be wowed by the magic that is their hamburgers. The place is that good! From the gooey cheese, sesame buns, to the crunchy fries- Pearl's does it right. The prices are very well for the city ($8-14 a hamburger, depending on the type) and is well portioned. If you're in the area, this is a definite must. Treat yoself.

Medium is very dry and bland, bun is a bit too healthy tasting and even bacon didn't seem to help add any moisture or flavor. On the other hand, their onion rings were overly greasy, but a bit too thin and overall a bit disgusting.

I have been to Pearl's many times and I have to say this is the juiciest burger I have ever had. The burger selection is pretty large, lots of inventive burgers with different toppings and even meat selection, grass fed, Kobe, bison meat.

As is mentioned in other reviews, small place and only a handful of tables. That's ok, I was taking it to go. Had The Bomb and the garlic fries. The Bomb served open face with onions, if you like. Since mine was to go, they put the chili on the side without me asking. Excellent! And there was more than enough chili for the burger, which is fine with me. Will order The Bomb again. The garlic fries start with their coated fries and the adds a copious amount of garlic. If you like garlic, you should be just fine. Even after lugging it all back to my hotel, the fries were still relatively crispy. While waiting for my order to be prepared, had a good view of other orders being made & delivered. Everything looked tasty. Overall, a great experience and I'll be back!

So happy I fulfilled my burger craving today. Was expecting a long line but to my favor I was the only guest there. Space is nice and cozy and service was great! I had the Pearls Deluxe Bacon Cheese Burger with fries and all I could say was that it was worth the incline stroll from Embarcadero. Burger was done right with fresh condiments and the fries had a nice seasoning to it with a perfect crunch. Sat comfortable at the large open window people gazing. Let's just say I did not want my Pearls Deluxe experience to end. Got my glute incline workout and a delicious burger waiting for me at the end. (Win/Win)

I don't know why I've been so underwhelmed with the places to eat near my office lately.This place is so-so, eh. Nothing fantastic out-of-this-world. Nothing terrible.I thought the burger meat itself was extremely flavorless. The cheese, mayo and mushrooms did nothing to add to the burger. I think even just a sprinkle of salt and pepper would make a considerable difference. The french fries though.. I LOVED the fries. LOL They are probably the saving grace for my meal. Wasn't too thrilled with the frequency of homeless folks walking right past the open window where I was sitting. But that's obviously not the restaurants fault. Just something to consider when you choose your seat. I had to put my cell phone away in my purse because I was nervous someone would walk pass and grab it off the table/counter. Anyway.. the man behind the counter was very friendly so that helps make for a positive experience.

Delicious burgers that are cooked just the way you want. I ordered the Bula Burger with a large side of onion rings. The burger was very delicious, cooked medium well. With it's melting cheese upon my bite and the taste of spicy pineapple & BBQ sauce, it has become a new favorite of mine. The onion rings were a bit small but still very good. They only take cash, but do have an ATM next to register in case you are only caring your debit card. I suggest the person you are with to grab a table while you order. Very small limited seating!

My husband came here a few Months ago when he first came to San Fran because someone recommended it. He liked it so much that he had to come back when we were in town for a few days! He was right these are good burgers. The garlic fries are very tasty too but you have to love garlic because they pack a mean garlic punch. The burger is nice and tender and full of flavor just what you want in a burger. They only accept cash which can be a hassle even though they have an ATM right by the register we saw a couple having trouble and couldn't take money out so they had to run to their bank. Other than that these burgers are tasty. The milkshake was like any regular milkshake nothing too different or special but good.

I wouldn't say anything I tried punched my mouth with the WOW factor, but Pearl's is unique as a burger joint.Pearl's has Carl's Jr size burgers, without the fast food behind it. The menu is large with a great amount of variety. From turkey, beef, kobe beef, and buffalo for your meat options, to salads, hot dogs, fries, onion rings and shakes. One good thing about the place is that you can get your meat cooked anyway you want it. Medium rare or anything lower if you dare is how I would suggest your meat be cooked. The buns they use tend to get dry towards the end, so all the juice you can get helps a lot as you try and devour the large size monster.Small spot, with only 3 tables and window seating. Cash only.

Been meaning to review this place, but this is simply the best burger place yet in California. Not only is the burger well cooked, the bun and topping are all fresh. The burger is a great size and worth the price, ranging from 7.99 to 10 depending. My favorite is the Bula Burger, which is a Hawaiian themed burger complete with a slice of pineapple.But that's not all, their shakes are AMAZING, which you think of when going to a burger place. With many flavors from cheesecake to peanut butter and many more.And lastly they always carry a side of pickles on the counter, I don't know whether or not if it's Dill or sliced anymore, but either way these are AMAZING.Overall, Pearl's is a standout and one of my top 3 Recommended food stops.

I love how the brain works. In this case, we were in dire need of burgers and were just trying to find some place that had great grub, on the cheap and a place to park. 2 out of 3 ain't bad right??I saw this spot come up in the Yelp search feed and seemed to remember it, but my brain is so broken and I've had so many burgers, I just couldn't remember if I've tried this place, although I thought I had. Was it good? Don't remember!!! We walk through the doors and it all came back to me. Yes, I've been!! Yes, it's pretty good. Yes, I ate the burger after a night of drinking and that probably lent itself to the goodness meter rising. No, it isn't cheap, but we found semi rock star parking for $2.25/hr. Burgers are giant, juicy, well seasoned and packed with flavor. Fries are ok, but nothing spectacular.Shakes were icy, creamy and delicious!!This place did the job we needed done and obviously I wouldn't choose this location as my go to pick for burgers or even add it to the top 5. It's just pretty good and pretty costly and that's all there is to it. Sometimes, a place to eat is just a place to eat. Not every place to eat can be Bix, right?

I had the avocado Burger and ended up just eating the serviceable avocado toast on the bottom *after adding salt. I would have rather paid $13 for a honestly overpriced avocado toast than this disingenuous 'gourmet' burger.

Seriously disappointing. Ordered burger well done and meat was barely cooked. Wasted my money. Fries and onion rings were good, but $10.00 plus for raw meat is unacceptable.

Our hotel recommended Pearls instead of the shady hamburger joint we were gonna hit and we were glad we did! Me and my husband split a BBQ sauce, cheddar and bacon burger- seriously good business, I would say the best burger I've ever had. What's genius is they offer "Frings", basket of half and half, fries/onion rings.

Luckily it away from union square or this place would be packed! One of the best burgers I had! For the price of around 10 you get a good size burger!. Highly recommend this place. A must go

I love this place, highly recommend the turkey burger. Although I do wish they would give you a more consistent amount of sweet potato fries in your order.

I'm sure this place gets tons of great reviews on its Burgers, but can we talk about the fries for a minute?!I am so particular about my fries--matchstick, crispy, flaky, salty, deep fried. You name it and I have a critique for how fries should be cooked. Pearls has some of the best fries hands down. There fries are just as good as their burgers if not I dare say better. That would be a very tough call to make though, so I will leave it to a more expertise person. Also, I might add the owner is just a great guy! You can see how passionate he is about his business and the care he puts into it for it to succeed. The very first time I order at Pearls he very casually told me about their new app and abilities to pay online to save me from having to use the ATM again. And kudos to him for seeing a need and meeting the demand. Placing an online is such convenience saves me from the $2.50 service fee I would have from using the ATM. Every time I have gone to Pearl's I am attended to right away, even if the register clerk is busy. I never wait long for food and treated as a valued customer. I love seeing business like Pearls thrive!

Pearlie Kobe Burger and Homemade Chili!Some of the best sweet potato fries I have had!~The RestaurantThe restaurant is tiny. Hospitality is Large! The customers were annoying. There is a hostile across the street and I think a mob of people staying there decided to come right before us. There are a few tables and some bar style seating. The place is cash only and there are large signs stating this. Despite the signs, customer after customer was making a big ordeal out of it. There is an ATM inside. I had my cash ready and just kept getting annoyed at the customers who were not ready. The group ahead of us was gobbling down the free dill pickles. The guy had to refill the container. I saw a lady even put some in a baggy.~Food- 4 StarsEverything here is about the same price (under $10). What costs extra is when you start customizing. I had the Kobe Burger with Homemade Chili and Avocado. It was pretty good. I think I would order it with the chili on the side next time.They also have kids size portions including a burger with cheese. Sweet Potato Fries stole the show. We ate these and even stopped by a second time to order a bag of these to go.~Prices- 4 Stars!Very reasonable.~Parking-?We walked here. It looks like parking is pretty easy on the street.Overall, I am a fan! Thanks Pearl!

Never try to miss this place! This place is a little hidden gem. It's clean and well-organized. Customer service was also good, service crew had been always ready help with your order. Had the pearl deluxe with Kobe beef and extra cheese and bacon. It was really delightful. One thing I dislike about this place, it's really hard to look for a spot to park your car.

Ordered BBQ Burger and side of sweet potato fries. Burger was over-cooked and dried out. Sweet potato fries were under-cooked and raw on inside. Guess I should have just ordered a salad...

The bula burger was large and very messy. I could barely taste the beefiness of the burger. There was also too much sauce. The fries are gigantic. The garlic fries were just regular fries with bits of toasted garlic on them. The sweet potato fries were light and sweet. The ketchup tasted awful.

Loved this place--Yelp comes to the rescue again!We had 2 veggie burgers--avocado and spicy. We cut them in half and shared. Also had fries and shakes. My strawberry shake was top notch!Service was friendly. When we finished we hung out for a while and they didn't try to hurry us out.We'll definitely be back!Note: cash only

I used to eat here all the time a couple years ago, but then I moved out of the area. I recently moved back, and was so excited to get a burger, but they just aren't what they used to be. And the fact that a burger is $10 or more?? I can get better than that at In-n-out. Even their sweet potato fries are just alright.

Definitely top 3 best burgers I've ever had. The prices are very reasonable and portions are perfect. Service is always great and food comes out pretty fast. I couldn't say one bad thing about pearl's. I come here very often and have never been disappointed. The shakes are to die for and the combination of fries are all delicious as well as the pickles made in-house. Check out the restroom too! Super cool. Pearl's is 100% great in my book.

Liked: Location, dining area is clean, price is somewhat decent. Not so much: Quality of food wasn't the best and big portion is not a substitute for taste, accepted cash only.PS: After a few bites, I couldn't finish my food. So I left for another place.

I was in San Fran for the day and was in the mood for a burger, so I decided to check this place out. Small joint inside, but the huge burgers and sides made up for it. Had the spicey oley kobe burger with "springs" as a side. Combo of sweet potato and onion rings. Personally, the onion rings are fire. Get ready for a mess, but it's definitely worth it. Only downside is that they take cash only and a meal for one could cost up to $25. Check this place out! It's worth the hype.

No salt, no flavor, no spices. The pictures looked great but my mushroom burger had absolutely no flavor. I didn't even think it was worth eating the 2nd bite so I gave it to my hungry boyfriend to finish. Waste of time and money here

Amazing! We came in right when they opened, owner was super friendly and helpful. Best burger either of us has ever had. High quality ingredients. We got the award winning bula burger, and the pearls deluxe with cheese and bacon. We also tried onion rings and fries. Incredible!! If you want an amazing burger check this place out!

Amazing huge delicious home style burgers. The burgers that are so big the first bite I took was mostly the bottom half of the entire burger - mayo , soft fresh bread, stack of lettuce, fresh tomatoes -- second bite of the original bite was straight beef. Super juicy. Excellent service - fast and friendly.

We came here 2 years ago. It was amazing then and just as good now. I don't think there is anything on the menu that will disappoint.The staff is attentive and helpful. It was not as busy two years ago but today there was a line the entire time we waited for our food. (We took it to go) There is not a lot of seating. So you may not get a seat.

This place is close to my apartment in SF. I have been all over the country and Pearls burgers are the best by far. This is one of my favorite burger joints and the owner/staff are among the friendliest I have experienced. My favorite burger is the Bula Burger with a strawberry cheese milkshake on the side. Only complaint is needs more seating, tho usually it works out.

Don't let the name trick you - "deluxe" in this sense doesn't mean "luxurious"! So if you're thinking of taking a classy lady all dressed up in high heels and full make up, think again. However, if you're with a classy lady who is down to get a little messy and loves a good burger, you've come to the right place.Burgers are around $6-15 depending on size of patties, add ons, and substitutions. It can get a little pricey, but you're definitely getting what you've paid for! They have a variety of fries and onion rings. The garlic fries are bomb - a must get!A hole in the wall that serves some BJ burgers (big juicy burgers)! The "deluxe" in Pearl's Deluxe Burgers definitely means "superior"! CASH ONLY! Bring those extra dollar bills otherwise you can't get that slice of cheese or upgrade to kobe beef. ;)
