Every time I come to Hillstones I am never disappointed. The ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful, warm, and reassuring. The waiters and prompt and friendly, making sure to periodically check up on all the tables.My favorite dish so far is their Ahi Tuna Salad. It comes with pieces of seared ahi tuna, slices of mango and avocado with delicious sauce drizzled on top of the salad. You can never go wrong with that choice! I also had a chance to try their famous French Dip, which was also delicious in its own right, but a little too much meat in one sitting for my stomach. Besides that, the appetizers are also delicious--i definitely recommend their fries and spinach artichoke dip!

This restaurant gives the air of being very sophisticated and fancy. The staff are impeccably dressed and the place is beautifully appointed yet when the menu came I was a bit disappointed. Overpriced sandwiches and appetizers on the lunch menu were the norm. I decided to get the French dip and was disappointed with the greasy tasteless sandwich. I additionally ordered the soup of the day which was very disappointing as well. In summation, this restaurant is like a Morton's when you walk in and an outback steakhouse on its menu. Save the money and go to outback.

My grandma lived in San Francisco for 92 years, and was a socialite. For the last 30 years of her life this was her favorite restaurant (before the name change). After her passing my family and I went there to celebrate her life. The fries were coldThe steak was over cooked The service was badThe staff was cold and uncaringThe bill was highAnd the manager didn't care about any of this. This last visit was a disservice to her memory and I will never visit them again. If want the above. This is your place. This only gets two stars from the memory of what the restaurant was, as I remember it growing up.

The boyfriend and I came here for a spontaneous date night on Friday. He made rezzies earlier in the day, and with good reason because the restaurant was packed when we got there at 8:30 pm!I ordered the hawaiian ribeye steak and subbed the french fries for seasonal greens (bok choy that day) and my bf ordered the filet mignon with a baked potato with all the fixings. The food took a little while to come out, so we ordered some focaccia bread on the side to tie down our hunger! When our meals finally came, we dug in! I loved the marinade on the Hawaiian ribeye; it made the meat so flavorful and it was a perfect medium rare. The marinade is sweet and tastes great with the melt in your mouth beef. The bokchoy was just subpar for me, nothing special. I just wanted to sub out the fries because I didn't want too heavy of a meal. My bf's filet was also cooked perfectly and was juicy and tender!Service was great and the ambiance is really appropriate for date night or a night out with friends. 10/10 recommend the hawaiian ribeye!!

Been here a few times and it's always been good. I remember this from socal but they call it Houston's there. Menu has a lot of overlapping items though. They have many locations but names vary by location. Love the Hawaiian rib eye which is always super flavorful. This time we opted for the bone in prime rib which......BE PREPARED...is a lot of meat. 32 ounces and yes the bone probably weighs a lot but still lots of meat. We typically share that between 2 people and then order a salad, side, or something lighter. It comes with a loaded baked potato but I like to substitute for mashed potatoes which is probably way more unhealthy with all that butter but way more tasty!! This time, we also shared the seared ahi tuna (or flying tuna as they menu calls it) which is good. The salad that comes with it is more impressive. Has a sweet tangy vinaigrette with avocados and tomato.

Not sure when Houston's changed their name to Hillstone. Pretty much nothing has changed except for the name. The restaurant menu and decor still looked the same. I came here to eat lunch with a friend. We picked this place because it was conveniently located near my hotel and right next to where she worked. Since it was the day after running the San Francisco Marathon, I ordered their salmon and an iced tea to help with any inflammation.*Pan-roasted Salmon*The description on the menu says filleted in-house, served with something green. :) That something green was bok choy. I think it went well with the salmon. The salmon was cooked just the way I liked it with the middle not fully cooked. It was pretty plain, but tasted good with a squeeze of the lemon.Service was great and friendly but a little slow since our waitress was with a trainee. Even though their food has always been pretty solid in quality and presentation, I have felt that their prices were somewhat higher than it should as it is almost borderline fine-dining prices. They're good, but not that good. Overall, I had a good dining experience and wouldn't mind making a return visit.

Hillstone was great for dinner. I easily made a same day reservation for 5 and a baby. I told them over the phone a baby would be along for dinner. When we arrived they had a table ready for our reservation. But they had NO high chairs or booster seats for a baby. They also would not allow her to sit in the dining area in her stroller. I get it. It's prob not a common place to bring a kid. But no high chairs? Why were we not told over the phone, "hey we don't have any booster seats or high chairs, We don't usually have kids here."I would have totally understood and would have booked else where. Our meal was lovely. They had really nice live music. My suggestion, get a booster seat and a high chair. There was another family there with a kid, and they had the same problem. Obviously kids might be dining every now and again. So accommodating them might be a good idea.

Nice loungy feel and high end service but view of a busy street. The crab cakes were not to my liking (blue lump not dungeness so rather fishy and soft) so they replaced with ahi seared, which was very good. Used to be free corkage for wine but now $15/bottle. Told server it was my sister in law's birthday and they brought her a candle in whipped cream, which was odd. Doubt I will return.

Hillstone probably has one of the best burgers in San Francisco!I went to Hillstone for my first time on Thursday. Introduced to me by one of my friends who is also a regular, he suggested that I order the Hickory Burger. To our dismay, the server told us that the Hickory Burger is no longer on the menu! It's only a specialty item available on FRIDAYS. So we were one day off, but the next best thing was the cheeseburger so that was what I ordered.Goddamn it was good. Served with a side of their crispy fries (that tasted like in-n-out fries btw) and their HOMEMADE honey mustard, I was a very, very happy girl.Tip: Ask for the salmon or artichoke to share and you MUST ask for the side of honey mustard (they do not advertise/offer)

Place is nice and fancy when you first walk in. Went in for lunch on a weekday with coworkers - ordered the spinach artichoke dip for starters. Not the best dip I've tasted before, I couldn't even taste the artichoke. What was additionally confusing was the salsa and sour cream served right next to it. Our server(s) were very pleasant and attentive. It seemed so "busy" since we had 1 person taking our drink orders, our waitress taking our food orders, someone else bussing the table, another person serving our dishes. I shared the well known chicken sandwich and a caesar salad which had cornbread as their croutons. The sandwich was huge and well beyond filling. The chicken was fried nicely, but the coleslaw was not my fave. The cornbread as croutons was different, unique and I didn't mind it. The dressing was also not the typical caesar dressing, but some type of vinaigrette which threw me off. Sometimes you just want a standard caesar salad, oh well. All in all, this place is decent to go to but it's not on the top of my list, especially for the price.

Had this place twice while in San Francisco. Had the spinach dip which was consistent both times. The flavor was so good and fresh. I had the chicken sandwich both times and it was soooo amazing I wish we had one in Chicago I would eat once a week. The fries were just ok, but so worth it. The service was great as well. Definitely recommend

I don't know why, but the other day, Yelp sent me an email asking about Hillstone. Well, now I feel obligated to share my experience. I've been in a handful of times, because it's close and convenient and there are often times many business travelers or singles dining at the dimly lit bar, so I'm not the only one. Now don't get me wrong, it's your quintessential date spot as well with the live jazz every night of the week, but flying solo here isn't awkward either. I think one could go casual here, but most of the patrons I've seen are typically business casual or strictly business. So keep it classy, and you'll be fine. My favorite go-to dishes would have to be the Lump Crab Cakes, the Kale Salad with peanut vinaigrette dressing and their Grilled Artichoke when it's in season! Yum. They carry an array of great reds by the glass, so take your pick! I usually do... Enjoy.

The food here is so good! We took a trip to San Francisco this past weekend for my birthday and discovered this place while we were walking along the pier. I ordered the French dip and my husband had the burger, the first time we tried this place out. Overall we were very satisfied. The interior is very nice and the staff was attentive. On our last day in SF we decided to have lunch here before our trip home. This time everything was going well until my husband found a hair in his burger. Although we lost our appetite, the staff took care of us and our bill. We still enjoyed our time there but unfortunately the hair got the best of us. We will return on our next visit though. Great place!

Like every other hillstone the customer service is impeccable. The restaurant is clean and runs efficiently. Usually the food is always amazing but for some reason the ahi tuna salad wasn't fantastic. There was way too much dressing. Also, the portion was pretty small for a $29 entree. This particular location is right next to the pier so there are tons of people. Expect a line even during off peak times!

This is the place my colleagues and I come to for our birthday lunches. Very pricey but then again it is on the Embarcadero across from the waterfront. Walk into the smell of the fall off the fork ribs. We come for the Thai steak noodle salad which is always delicious. 5 big pieces of perfectly cooked filet mignon with mango and cilantro and peanuts and a delicious dressing. About $22 for a salad but worth it for something special. Every time my brother visits from Missouri this is his must have. The Ahi tuna salad is also very good. Not as good as it used to be and portions are smaller. The fried chicken sandwich is also delicious and huge! The slaw is what makes it special. Definitely make reservations especially if you are 6 or more.

It was my first time at this location, however, Hillstone Group is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant company. I've only been to the locations on the east coast, so i was excited when i found this location while on vacation in San Fran. The food quality was the same, Hillstone always delivers on 5 star service and food quality. Of course i had my fav, the spinach dip and Hawaiian ribeye fit for a queen or king :). It was just as i expected and i loved every bit of it. If you are use to fine dining or just good tasting food you have to try Hillstone or any of their restaurants. You will not be disappointed.

I came here for a client lunch and wasn't expecting to be wowed or anything. Definitely wasn't expecting the food here to light my world on fire, especially at San Francisco prices. I ordered the hickory burger, because why not? When it came out, on half of the bun there was a huge mound of shredded cheese with red onions sprinkled on top. I love cheese, don't get me wrong.... but that was a mound of cheese!!!!!!The burger itself was alright. Nothing special. At nearly $20 a piece, I don't think it's worth spending unless you expense it to your work Amex :)Ambiance was alright too, nothing special. Sort of old school looking restaurant.

Whenever I crave prime rib it's always last minute . So obviously I can't get a reservation at HOPR. I come here instead because I also love their spinach artichoke dip and sundae! This is one of the only restaurants I actually force myself to eat an appetizer, entree, and dessert! FYI, sodas are served by the bottle so no free refills. But for some reason I never liked soda from the bottle since it always seems to taste flat to me. It's ok just order alcohol!

This Hillstone lives up to the brand name, it's equally delicious as any other Hillstone restaurant I've been to. Tonight I got here around 8pm and there was a 45 minute wait for a table for 2. So my girlfriend and I got an appetizer at the bar while waiting for a table. We got the spinach artichoke dip and it is delicious. It comes with chips and salsa and sour cream as well. I would highly recommend this appetizer. After the appetizer we got reseated at a normal table near the live band, which was nice. I'm not sure if they have a live band every night, or if it's just because it's a Saturday tonight. Anyways, I got my usual entree here, the Famous French Dip. It's a prime rib sandwich that comes with au jus dipping sauce, and I also get BBQ sauce on the side. The sandwich is fantastic, although a little plain (just the meat and mayo). But I like plain sandwiches so it's perfect for me. This is definitely one of the best French Dip sandwiches around. My girlfriend got the kale salad with chicken. She said it was good, but it's a lot of chicken and not quite enough greens. But overall still good. The service is always great here, and the prices are a bit high but the food quality is very high as well. I give it 4 stars - which to me means a very good restaurant, I reserve 5 stars for only the best of the best.

After attending a convention at pier 27, my friend and I were looking for a close-by place to grab a bite. Hillstone was walking distance and pics looked good, so off we went! Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and ordered the grilled artichoke and rosemary foccacia appetizers. The grilled artichoke, which was served with a delicious aoili, was one of the best I've had in a long time! Grilled to perfection, salty and properly spiced. Yum! The foccacia was also good, but we had to ask for extra olive oil to dip in, as it came with barely any. For entrees, we ordered the smoked salmon with toast points (actually a starter) and the crispy chicken sandwich. Just FYI, "toast points" is a fancy way to say triangle toast, but I absolutely love that term and how fancy it sounds. Dignified toast. Fact. Anyway, that was excellent, and the crispy chicken sammy was a delight as well! I don't even like cole slaw, but the kale one they put on there was bomb! Price was a bit expensive (our bill was about $70 with tip, no drinks were ordered), but the food was the quality I would expect at that price point. Minus one star for service - they were pushy about drinks and she kept taking all my plates away too soon. She almost took my aoili before I was done eating the artichoke, but I shut that ish down quick! Overall, 8/10, would recommend.

My mind has adjusted back to EST, but my salivating tongue is dreaming of one thing only: The French Dip sandwich from Hillstone. Lord Almighty, this place will blow your mind. The swanky, dimly-lit joint presents itself as a classic jazz lounge. Yes, that means live music on a nightly basis. Servers and bartenders are dressed in their finest wares. The star of the show is not only the dishes and cocktails, but the fine attention to detail.Famous French Dip - An absolute must order, famous for good reason. Mouthwatering from start to finish. Velvety prime rib on a house made roll. The au jus was the creme de la creme, but I tip my cap to the horseradish sauce. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Succulent, soft, and overwhelmingly rich.The Grilled Artichokes were excellent, too. We shared these at our table and were floored with the meatiness and flavors all around. And I don't know what it is about Old Fashioned's in SF, but they are significantly superior than FL. Hillstone's take on the classic cocktail, made with Buffalo Trace, was phenomenal.I can't believe this place is a "chain," if you will. Ten locations scattered across the country, even two in Florida. I will be a returning customer and your unpaid brand ambassador eight days a week.

We had some out of town guests visiting SF and decided to bring them to Hillstone in the city. We regularly frequent their sister restaurant Los Altos Grill in the Mid-Peninsula which we absolutely love. Hillstone SF has a very similar decor with lots of comfy booth seating. It has the added benefit of being located right along the Embacadero with some nice views of the bay side. For starters, we tried the Artichoke and Spinach Dip (since they were out of Grilled Artichoke). It was nice, but not nearly as good as the Grilled Artichokes we've had at the Los Altos Grill. For entrees, we tried the Bone-in Prime Rib, Rotisserie Chicken, Emerald Kale and Chicken Salad, and Famous French Dip. The Prime Rib is a hefty cut, so either share it or be very very hungry. Rotisserie Chicken is a good choice, but somewhat plain and simple and not especially outstanding. The French Dip was good with the tasty and tender prime rib meat, but the bun here was not as nicely toasted as it is usually served at Los Altos Grill. I liked the Emerald Kale and Chicken Salad with the light peanut vinaigrette -- very fresh, clean flavors. To finish, we shared the Key Lime Pie, which is a seasonal dessert at the Hillstone restaurants, but it's probably one of the best key lime pies anywhere with just the right balance of sweet and tart, and a delicious pecan nut crust. We liked the free corkage on the first bottle of wine you bring (again consistent with other Hillstone restaurants), but they also have a good selection of wines on their menu. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner here, but still much prefer the food at our regular Los Altos Grill where their menu boasts quite a few favorites that are not available at Hillstone SF, including the Skillet Cornbread, Deviled Eggs, Macho Chicken Salad, Ahi Salad, BBQ Rib & Chicken Combo, and more.

I've eaten here more than 4 occasions and I've always had a great experience. The people were always accommodating and very understanding. I had a friend who felt sick and had to leave dinner but he left after we ordered 4 dishes and each were priced about 40+ per plate. The waitress was kind enough to understand the situation and when I asked if we could cancel the order she told me that it was already being cooked instead of giving me a hard time she told me she'd comp the steak (which tasted amazing) this was very nice of her as I couldn't afford to pay everything.In separate occasion I brought my closest friends and my mom who all loved the food. Favorite items:French Dip - best one in the Bay Area.The ribs were amazing if you have any out of towners this is the dish for them. It is a bit pricey but it's definitely worth the experience. The ambiance is great with live music and a good bar list. Go!

Even though Hillstone is the parent company I liked it when it was Houstons better. We have gone to Hillstone and Houstons both in the same city (Scottsdale) and Houstons always stands out. The menu is basically the same but what a difference. Maybe it's just mindset. I would have given Hillstone 5 stars, but they are lacking in attitude. I love all of the Hillstone Group Restaurants it's just that some do better then others.

Updated review
I've been a huge fan of Hillstone for years and I still am, however after tonight's visit I'm sadly downgrading it to a 3. Why?First and foremost, Hillstone was one of the few restaurants in SF that you could go to with your own wine that had excellent food and no corkage. As of this month, after what I think is a change in the restaurant's entire history, the waived corkage fee is no more. This really irks me because I buy a fair amount of expensive wine and I like to bring in bottles of it to enjoy with excellent food. No mystery there. I also fully understand that the restaurant wants (and needs) to make money in that department so I can appreciate how this was a drag on the bottom line, however there are enough people like me who go almost exclusively for this perk to drive up headcount ordering over priced food, so it should balance out. I guess the bean counters finally decided that isn't the case so they joined 99% of the other restaurants in the practice of assessing corkage fees, which is more than a minor nuisance.I was always willing to overlook the high prices of the food because of the no corkage fee. Tonight though I paid $50 for a (very) petite filet mignon with a very small side of mashed potatoes and an equally small side of "something green" which in this case was bok choy. It was good but portions were seriously small. For $50 I'm just not convinced it's a value anymore. It seemed to me overall prices on the menu have gone up a bit. Not a huge amount and I could be wrong on this but I'll say again I always overlooked the highish prices because of the no corkage fee. All in all, the food is still fine and they still filled up so I am sure they will still continue to do well as they deserve to, but I wish they would bring back the no corkage fee and move their prices down a bit to keep in line with industry standards. As long as they're packing them in nightly though this isn't likely to happen. I will be taking a hiatus though for a while and hope I am pleasantly surprised if and when I return.

Visiting San Francisco, came to this restaurant to have a glass of wine and maybe an appetizer. Sat at the bar area, waited 15 minutes, no one came to our table, stood up, went to the hostess, waited another minute until someone came to help. Managers saw me, other severs saw me, but no one bothered to greet us. Finally, someone noticed me. I asked about getting service, they told me to go directly to the bar and ask the bartender for a menu and drinks. I went to the bartender and she told me she will help. Waited another 10 minutes. I stood up again upset and told the bar that we still haven't been helped. Thankfully a server came over to our table and helped us. They are busy at this time but we still shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes to even get acknowledged. No one even came to say that they would be with us in a few minutes, just walked on past our table not making eye contact, even the managers were doing the same. Food is decent and drinks are good.

A friend told me about this place. We went on a Sunday night. We made reservations a few days before. Inside pretty. On the darker side. Great for families and groups without kids. We ordered the salad with buttermilk garlic dressing. Amazing. Veggies were very fresh. Bacon was very good. For entrees, we ordered the cheeseburger and salmon. Cheeseburger was so good. Very messy though, since it is so big. The house made buns were tasty. The salmon was good, but nothing special. The broccoli was very good. The house cocktails are ok. I ordered a lemon drop and it was very good. Well balanced. For desert we orders the brownie al a mode. It was good. The nut mixture on top gave it a good crunch. Service was very good. Friendly and very efficient. Our food came out fast. Bar service was fast, too, even though it was packed.

3.5 stars to be exact. My family and I came here for dinner. It was a decent experience for us. There were some good points, and some bad, thus just mediocre experience.We had reservations at 5:30 on Christmas Eve. We checked in with the hostess and was seated in about 10-15 mins. I got a couple drinks at the bar, and boy they were strong AF. Plus one point. Tasty alcohol with the greyhound and Italian soda.Once seated we had a few people come to help us with drinks, etc. I couldn't tell who was our actual server. A little overwhelming. We started off with the spinach dip - not the best. Main dishes - veggie burger, flying tuna, crab cakes, rib eye, and the famous french dip sandwich. The food was just alright, not really my cup of tea. The veggie burger was homemade, which was cool. I think the best dish was the tuna, it just melted in your mouth. Loved it. Portions were mehhh for the price. Knock off points would include that my dad's order didn't come out until we were practically done with dinner. Apparently, the waitress forgot to take his order, so she had to put in the order after we asked a couple times where it was. That kinda ruined dinner for my dad of course. Then when we ordered another drink, it came out wrong, even after the waitress confirmed the drink we wanted. Service was the lackluster part of our meal.Overall, people will pay for the ambiance of Hillstone, no doubt, it's a pretty solid restaurant.

Disclaimer- this place may very well be fabulous for steak, but I didn't have it so can't speak to that.Went here on a Friday night, split between two we got a burger, a sandwich a small salad to split and 1 drink each. It was about 100$. I wasn't thinking it would be cheap, but the food just wasn't very exciting for the cost and the drinks were totally boring (think syrupy airport old fashioned). Staff was great though. Too bad you can't eat food outside, might have made it a bit more interesting.

"The wind blew some luck in my direction. I caught it in my hands today." Ok, enough of tripping down memory lane to the tune of "Moonlight Feels Right" by Starbuck.The song reminded me of my circumstance right before entering Hillstone. My wife, son, his girlfriend and I had just come off the boat to Alactraz on the night tour. Needless to say it was windy, raining, and miserable weather-wise.Frankly, I had no idea we were going out to dinner but wouldn't you know it, the Hillstone sign beckoned in the dark with a come hither pull of warmth, food, and hospitality.Indeed, that's what we found.Our waitress was clever, sublime, and charming. Food and beverages were served in good fashion and the taste of the food was good.While a little pricey (Ergo, four stars) the menu runs the gamut and the wine selection is very good (Good on you Hillstone for carrying a fine selection of Joseph Phelps vineyard).In short time we forgot all about the storm especially as I consumed a very well made Cafe Americano.Returning to the storm wasn't so bad after eating here. That's a good sign your eating in the right place like a rainbow after a heavy downpour!

Oh baby! Come here hungry because the portions are huge!I gift the prime rib on the bone which is served after 5pm but the wait staff is amazing so they pulled some strings! PRO TIP: of you get here before 6pm you'll get a seat after 7 you will need a reservation. Get the rib if you're hungry or want to split a meal. It's about $40

Dinner here is expensive and worth the price. This is an intimate space for a first date and I have always found live music when I come for dinner.At $36.00 the Hawaiian Rib-eye is a personal favorite that couldn't be more perfect. Slightly charred and medium rare every bite of pineapple infused beef just seems to melt away in my mouth. Note this is only available on Saturday and they do run out.At $37.00 the BBQ Pork Ribs are slow cooked for eight hours overnight and then warmed to order thus the meat is so tender, it falls off the bone.At $26.00 the Thai Steak & Noodle Salad can be quite sweet with avocado and mango but still a personal favorite. At $23.00 I don't know of a better or more generous French-dip with coleslaw or fries and au jus and horseradish on the side.At $12.00 the Emerald Kale Salad is wonderful with its peanut and herb dressing.At $10.00 their featured soup, tonight a chili with cheddar was excellent.

My husband and I came for dinner on a Friday so when we were told there was a wait we weren't that surprised. They told us it was an hour wait and I reluctantly agreed to wait. Oh boy was that a mistake! In retrospect I wish we had just walked over to north beach but oh well.We ended up waiting an hour forty minutes to be seated at a table that had been empty and ready for guests for 40 minutes. The staff seemed more concerned about looking productive and beautiful than actually running the restaurant. Once we were seated it was another 20 minutes until we were even brought water. Multiple staff members walked by in a hurry pretending to be occupied and often 3 people would go clear one table. Ridiculous! The food we ordered, focaccia, smoked salmon, steak and noodle salad and ribs was all over salted and just completely mediocre. We could not wait to leave and will never ever come back.This place is for middle aged tourists who want the appearance of going to a nice restaurant. In reality it's just middle aged people who want to feel young and get drunk at a crappy overpriced restaurant. Skip it! You'll thank me

I went to Hillstone on my last visit to SF and was dreaming about it until I returned last week. More specifically, dreaming of the Famous French Dip. It's the signature dish and rightly so, my mouth is still watering from it.You should really book this place if you are planning to dine here but we were happy to try their greyhound cocktail (fresh grapefruit and vodka) and hang by the bar for a cool 20 mins. I was in great company so it felt like 2 minutes as we chatted about the classy establishment's charming decor, intimate atmosphere AND the live jazz band. Once seated we were ready to order, although I've been ready for a month to order this again. We decided to share the Grilled Artichoke which had such rich flavours combined perfectly with the creamy dip on the side. The French Dip finally arrived, and it was everything I remembered. The in-house made bun, filled with succulent medium rare prime rip with delicious and surprisingly light gravy on the side and a creamy horseradish sauce. Just WOW. I never normally order the same dish when I dine out, but I can't wait for my next trip to SF for that exact same meal. Loved every bite.

I am a HUGE fan of Hillstone. I have been going to the Boston location for nearly 15 years now but sadly it closed. I have been to this location twice now and it just never seems to disappoint. On this last visit, I was with two of my colleagues and we came here off of my recommendation.We all got the french dip sandwich with french fries. Let me just tell you, this could quite possibly be the best sandwich out there. The meat is so tender, so buttery that it melts in your mouth. The fries are thin and crispy and coated with just the right amount of salt. The crunch of the fries is a nice break from the soft, succulent sandwich that just oozes down your chin from one too many dunks in the au jus. Oh and don't let me forget that horseradish cream sauce that comes with it. A nice schmear of the sauce adds the right amount of kick. On this last visit, somehow, someway, the table next to us and our table ended up with ketchup everywhere. We have no idea where it came from but ketchup definitely exploded all over us. The server took off our artichoke app as an apology but no one could really explain what happened. Still, this is hands down one of my favorite places and I will be back... Every time I am in San Francisco. Try the ribs, the steaks, the soups... ALL AMAZING

We went to Hillstone Wednesday night- a follow up to our visit about 3 months ago about which I've written a review-- happy to report the manager that was at Los Altos Grill is now in charge at Hillstone and it shows what good management can mean to a restaurant. The food was excellent-- but let's start with the drinks-- wow. Apps were super-- the artichoke alone could give the overall review a 4, but seriously good. Service kicked up a notch too. In that regard my only comment is one never knows who the "server" is-- we had at least 4 different people wait on us and it made is slightly confusing since no single person "owned" our table. I know they do it to get the food out fast/- not a huge nit. Then we had our entries-- I had the chicken and it was better than advertised-- cooked perfectly, moist, juicy and very tasty. Substitute for my sides was no problem- just ask. My wife had the prime rib. An enormous piece of fine meat -- cooked perfectly and we ended taking 1/2 home-/No room for dessert-- love the lighting and ambience at Hillstone. Now if they would only put their famous deviled eggs on the menu...

I like the Hillstone restaurants since they have more than one choice, the only thing that I didn't like on that day is the music band was sitting right behind our table and it was getting louder and louder, which makes me don't want to stay anymore and want to leave the place. Service and food was good as always.

Hillstone is a great spot to go for a nice dinner. The atmosphere is amazing, the lighting is perfect and the seating is comfortable. When there is live entertainment it's even nicer. The service is great as well, I have always gotten timely and nice service here. Finally, the food is awesome. The salads are unreal, I usually don't love salads for dinner but these ones are an exception.

I just dined here for the first time, it has a very nice atmosphere in the evening. The lights are turned down and moody. The interior is like a toned down version of Elephant Bar, with American accent furnishings. The food is alright. It's like a high class version of Denny's, with a better selection.

So, I took my daughter to see a concert with her friends at the Warfield Theatre in downtown San Francisco. I wasn't allowed in because I'm a dad and not cool. Anyway I decided to find a nice restaurant in the area to visit while I waited. I drove down to the embarcadero and found Hillstone.The hostess was pleasant but gave the complimentary "too big" of a smile when I said I did not have a reservation, and then she proceeded to tell me it was a 1 hour wait. I had time to kill so I said ok. About 30 minutes later she came up to me said she had a table and I was seated.The menu had the standard stuff for a so called American Bistro, but they did have an item called their "Famous French Dip". If your gonna use a word like "Famous" I'm gonna try it. So I asked the waitress if it was really famous and she said "Oh Yes" it's great. Begrudgingly I said ok, let's try it. Damn it was good, but because I am very old I know what this really is....An old fashioned "SHAVED MEAT" sandwich on a sourdough french roll with some Au jus Drippings and Creamed Horseradish. You cannot find a place that does Shaved Meat anymore, it was shaved prime rib to be honest, but when it's 2" thick of juicy shaved prime rib you can't go wrong. I don't know if San Francisco was the only place back in the day that used to serve Shaved Meat Sandwiches but I sure miss them, and this place does them very well.I have not tried other choices, but their Famous French Dip is worth the drive or if your visiting the city for the day.Just go....

Hillstone is one of those comforting, excellent food and service places in SF. We have been going here for years for the food primarily, their artichokes are world class, always have their tender ribs! Having lived in Rome where artichoke preparation is an art form, I can say that this place is top notch. One thing I am always struck by are the servers , Daniel, Alex and Tiffany are exceptional attentive. We were sitting at the bar this time waiting for a table in their gorgeous patio and Tiffany noticed that someone who came in after us was seated first. She immediately walked over to the receptionist and in minutes we were seated outside. Whoever does the hiring has put together a top notch staff.

Shout out to staff at Hillstone. 4 years ago my husband "officially " proposed to me at this location, the staff helped him with the set up and it was a great night. Tonight my husband took me to a belated birthday dinner at Hillstone and the occasion was just as nice as the engagement night. Additionally, one of the waiters accidentally tossed out the remainder of my crab cake meal( delicious !)that had been sent to the back to be d wrapped to go. As an apology, Hillstone cooked another crab cake meal and wrapped the entire meal for me to take home! They went over and above great customer service, I really felt appreciated as a customer! Kudos Hillstone!

The meat fell off of the ribs, the cocktails were tasty, however this wasn't something that I would write home about. BBQ food is always the same everywhere you go and this place wasn't any different. I loved the roasted artichokes and the focaccia was amazing. However, the ribs and French dip tasted the same as every other BBQ place that I have visited before. I didn't hate this restaurant. The vibe is fun and the service it good but I didn't love this place either.

Hillstone is a classy and upscale restaurant located in the Embarcadero/North Beach area of San Francisco. The menu features a wide array of options from sushi to salads and from steak to burgers. Most all of the menu items are served from peak-of-freshness ingredients and the utmost attention to detail. The restaurant is filled with warm wood, contemporary art, dark red booths, and the dull roar of a hundred conversations over soft jazz and the clattering of several dishes. The dining room gives way to a bar, several booth seating and tables, as well as a gorgeous patio area with trees and heat lamps. The staff is friendly and service excellent, adding to the overall experience. It can run a little pricey, but it serves delicious food!

Hillstone used to be Houston's, and you can tell by the service. The ready smile and the quick /impecable service is still here, alive, and well.Unfortunately, the food is seriously lacking. In a city with so many great food options, I was sorely disappointed with options we ate: the cheeseburger, the french dip sandwich, and the artichoke/spinach dip were all hasbeens of another era. 10+ dollars for a cup of spinach dip with a dab of artichoke with some tortilla chips? French dip sandwich for over 15? Comon...I've had better at less expensive prices. The Houston's that left definitely disappeared in terms of the food. Is this an expensive, classy diner? I really couldnt' tell the difference. I always liked Houston's more than Fog City Diner down the street, which tried to pass itself off as an upscale brasserie. It looks like Hillstone has decided to go down the same path, rather than set itself apart.Take your hard earned dollars elsewhere. The margins this restaurant is trying to achieve are too high, and you can have a nice date for the same cost elsewhere.

Came here for my best friends 21st birthday with a big party. Ordered two bottles of wines and some appetizers. Manager walks over to tell us that tables are only reserved for parties that order entrees. After telling him that we are here for a birthday they said they may have to move us to the bar. Once I showed a bit of disappointment and literally offered to order one single entree to be able to stay, they "allowed" us to stay so they wouldn't ruin the birthday. The manager was very nice but acted a little sarcastic so I couldn't tell... either way, should never bring that up when we have already eaten and drank two bottles of wine. Been to many hillstones, houstons, and gulfstreams and never experienced this...

Very nice restaurant and serving staff. Bar was well managed. Menu good. However avoid the Blackened Ribeye if it is offered. The blackened seasonings were way over done and were nothing but a charcoal crust. Not wonderful. Total destruction of a great cut of beef. My friends had the Bone In Prime Rib. Both sent it back to be cooked a bit further and they came back perfect. That cut looked more appetizing.

They lost my reservation, which was kind of bummer considering it was a Saturday night as well as a busy night in the city with all the women's marches going on. They were able to give my friend and I a table, but service was pretty basic and all of the waitresses and waiters just didn't seem happy to be there. I frequent all of the Hillstone restaurants a lot and keep coming back because the food is consistently good (hence the four stars), but across the board, service seems to have gone down hill sadly!

Technically a chain as part of the Hillstone group but all that means is consistently great food and service! I've been dozens of times. Wish they had a "Buy 10 prime ribs, get one free" card...FOOD:-Have tried and liked almost everything on the menu. Favorites are smoked salmon, grilled artichoke, french dip, prime rib, and ice cream sundae. -I wish they had the cornbread, enchilada, and oreo cookie sandwich like at Rutherford's, Los Altos Grill, and Bandera (can you tell I'm a fan of the Hillstone group?).-FYI you can order boneless prime rib for lunch (not on the menu but available by request).-Sometimes they run out of prime rib! I suspect especially on Sunday nights since that's typical time for prime rib dinner.DRINKS:-No corkage for the first bottle of wine. Subsequent bottles are $20 each, regardless of how many people are in your party.-Sodas are bottled, not fountain, so no refills.SERVICE:Always great. All of the waiters/waitresses help each other out so you can ask any of them if you need something.PARKING:There's usually metered street parking available but beware it goes until 11 pm!

Love the ambiance, service is wonderful, the food is amazing!! The price is very reasonable for prime rib compare to house of prime rib, u get a huge huge piece including bone for $39 and a loaded potato, the horseradish is delicious I kid you not it's not spicy or strong it's sweet and well balanced, the ribs looks delicious and they give you a whole rack! One of the coolest thing is that you can bring YOUR OWN WINE and they will open it and no charge, they play beautiful live music, with everyone chatter it's a little loud, but I recommend every family or friends to come here on a nice romantic date night.

I have to say, food was good and consistent every night we at here on vacation. Staff was friendly and even one waitress remembered us from the night before. It was July 4th weekend so the wait times were slow, but we weren't in a hurry. One night our waiter never brought the soup we ordered, but it all worked out. Wish we had a Hillstone back home!
