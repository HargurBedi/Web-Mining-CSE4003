Thanks San Francisco for the cool and relaxed diner. I went to Roxanne Cafe twice during my stay in San Francisco and it was pretty nice. I had something called The Francisco (smoked salmon, eggs, jack cheese, on a croissant). It was pretty tasty, reasonably priced, and the food wait was quick. I'd go back again..Maybe for the same thing again.

We came on what is probably their most chaotic day of the year - Christmas - but overall had a pleasant experience. Pros:- some of the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. It was very buttery in flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente! I highly recommend it. It is also a great portion size compared to the Lobster Ravioli, which was pretty small.- the bread pudding dessert is a must-try! It's very fresh and creamy, and comes with a wonderful vanilla gelato. It's also pretty large so it's a great dessert to shareCons:- we had an 8:00 reservation but there was a line out the door of other people trying to get seats. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes, unable to grab the attention of any waitresses, so it was clear that they were giving away the reserved tables to whomever was ahead of us in line... I wish they would have asked who had reservations and seated us first!- our waters didn't get refilled at all Maybe if you don't come in on a busy holiday the service would be better, but overall the food was good so if I find myself in SF again, I would come back.

[Out-of-Towner Review]If it has a lot of stars in SF, it's too crowded.Well, that's what we've learned the last few breakfast/brunch attempts. This time was no different. We decided on Roxanne's because of proximity to our parking spot, that is the only reason.When we walked in, there was a small line which moved quickly. Eat and run had a new meaning. You felt the pressure of those waiting to be seated as you ate your meal. No diddle dawdling here!We got down to business when we were seated. Looked at the menu and had a decision within a few minutes. Just having finished a 10k, we were all pretty ravenous. Me, even enough to go for the Steak and Eggs. J went with the Corned Beef Sunrise and Lil with the Strawberry waffles.I may expect too much from restaurants in the City, since so many seem to be so amazing. Roxanne's left plenty to be desired, especially with portion and price.My meal came out nothing like how I ordered it. A medium well steak with crispy potatoes came out a very well done steak with not at all crispy potatoes. I will say, the seasoning on their soft potatoes was really, really good. Almost good enough to ignore the fact that they weren't prepared for how I like them to be. Its cool if they can't make them crispy, then the server should had mentioned that too me, instead of leaving me assuming my order would be correct. The steak was tough and small in portion size, it was ehh.J and Lil enjoyed their dishes to an extent. Anything after 6.2 miles tastes pretty decent. The waffle was okay, seemed to be lacking in strawberries. They did use real corned beef, instead of the can stuff, so that made that dish better. This dish size seemed to be on the larger size, which was appreciated.Their house coffee was decent and lil enjoyed her tea. Our server wasn't bad, but she didn't even ask how our meal was after she brought it. You can tell this place stays busy, so customer service doesn't have to be their strong suit. They get the job done at minimum and it seems to work for them.We all left disappointed and at least still 15% hungry...

Stopped here on a whim last night before we left town. It was the only restaurant in the area with less than an hour wait so I was concerned about the quality. Food was actually pretty decent for the price, it was just too small of a place to navigate. A handful of tables and they're all on top of each other. The staff was making the best of what they had but it was a bit annoying to have to scoot your chair in every time someone moved. Definitely not an intimate place to eat, but does just fine if you don't mind getting cozy with random strangers and everyone hearing each other's conversation.

Delivery service was VERY fast (25 minutes) and the food was ok, but not worth it for the price. You can't order desserts to-go either which is a disappointment and a mistake.

The staff is slow and rude. Took 10 minutes just to get a glass of water in an empty restaurant. The Caprese appetizer took forever to come out (4 tomato slices and 4 slices of mozzarella, come on) and we were delighted (totally sarcasm) to see that it just came out at the same time as our entree. The chicken piccata was not good and way overpriced for what was. Stay away unless you enjoy being disappointed.

The food was decent, but the service could be better.I knew as soon as we were greeted upon walking in that the service might be trouble. The woman who "welcomed" us seemed inconvenienced that we were there. She was already turning and starting to walk away after I placed my order like she couldn't wait for me to stop talking. The water we requested was forgotten, and I had to wait a few minutes to get a refill on my coffee after the cup was completely empty.I asked for a straw for my water (the server had several in her apron), and she said something to another server who then asked me what I wanted. I asked her for a straw (she also had several in her apron) and she went behind the counter to find me a straw. Very weird.The food was good, but nothing special. Breakfast sandwich was ok but the potatoes were soggy. They tasted good, but they were way too soft.Our table was against a brick wall in a corner. It was actually cozy there but the table was too small to fit all of our plates, glasses, condiments, etc.I probably wouldn't go back.

I wouldn't mind the prices at this place if the food had been good enough to qualify what I paid. I would venture to say that the prices were about 30 to 40% above what they were worth. They should either lower their prices, or put a little more passion into their menu items. The bread wasn't even even good, it was like store-bought bread, and it was served cold. Pretty disappointing.

Ambiance: convenient location near Union Square, right off the cable car line at Powell. Small restaurant, but they were able to accommodate some larger groups (6-8). Best for parties of 2-4.Service: really friendly, good service. Food:-Belgian waffle: pretty much what you would expect. Not exceptional, but good. -California omelette with fruit (instead of potatoes): this omelette was tasty, had a generous amount of avocado, and the fruit was fresh. Overall, I won't be aching to come back, but it's a good place if you're visiting and need a good meal.

We chose this restaurant because it was close to the hotel where we were staying and we wanted a place that served pancakes. Most of the nearby breakfast spots just serve coffee and a limited menu of baked goods. We also figured that a Yelp rated 3 star place would be half way decent. However, I think that there may be a certain degree of "grade inflation " that applies to Yelp reviews in general and this restaurant specifically.Our table had a vase with a fresh rose in it which normally would be a nice touch except that this rose wasn't fresh. It was actually wilted and turning brown. We decided that the flower was symbolic of the experience at this place.Our waitress was aloof from the start and pretty much stayed that way. We were a table of two and the only ones in the place. When she served our drinks, she didn't know which drink went to which customer. Same thing when she served our food. The food itself was also below average. A previous Yelp review described the pancakes as "fluffy" but unfortunately, ours were heavy and doughy. The Belgian waffle was more soft than crisp. The food wasn't piping hot which was surprising since we were the only ones there. Prices were cheaper than dining at one of the chi chi hotels nearby, so ten dollars for a plain waffle with no side dishes is a screaming bargain. Fruit cup ($5) was a small dish with some unripe honeydew and a little strawberry, kiwi, and orange on top.Based on other reviews of this place, it seems that your results may vary.

Came here for breakfast today since I wanted eggs benedict. I ordered the Salmon eggs benedict and my husband the blueberry french toast. Both werr delicious. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs was perfection. The seating was prompt,however, the minus 1 star was for the slowness of service. Good thing we weren't on a time crunch otherwise 1 hour for breakfast (off peak time 10:30) is perhaps too long.

I'll keep this one short but if you're going for breakfast don't expect too much. I'll admit I had a pretty standard breakfast, the Roxxane Grande. The pancakes were nice and fluffy, bacon crispy, and eggs cooked well. But the pork sausage they use was too greasy for my tastes. The home fries were interesting, since they were a bit mushy but still crispy? And I was hoping for more onions and bell peppers in it too. Still, it got the job done otherwise and the service was on par. If you can't get into one of the fancier spots nearby this one will at least get the job done.

This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I would give it a negative five stars if yelp allowed it. My cheeseburger was smelling so I asked the exceptionally rude waitress to take it away and a few minutes later, the manager comes to the table with a raw piece of meat patty to explain how their meat is fresh. Who does that? How can anyone bring a piece of uncooked meat to the table. Then she kept arguing about their food being fresh. The meat patty on my burger was twice the size and square in shape. The raw meat she brought to the table was a thin round patty. We had to get up and leave with a young 4 year still hungry and tired. Overall, it was a horrible experience. The worst customer service here. Avoid this place like the plague!

An adorable little cafe for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We stayed down the street at the St Francis Hotel in Union Square and went out for a walk to see what could be found. We saw a line in front of Roxanne and kept walking, circled back around the line was gone. We sat at the counter and a sweet Latina lady about 5 feet tall said hi and gave us menus. She complemented my younger daughter on her smile and asked her a couple questions. Our assigned waitress then came over and barely smiled or acknowledged us. It took her at least 10 minutes to take our drink order, we were ready by then to order. I asked her how big the omelet was, she seemed super uninterested in answering any questions pertaining to her food service job, no smile, not even a tinge of jocundity. I know perhaps you had a bad morning or whatnot, but c'mon, I'm being really pleasant, show me a little love here, lady. We ordered a Mexican omelet to share, a side of fruit, bagel, oj and hot tea. It came out 10 minutes later or so, and yeah, Sullen Sandy puts the food down and quickly turns and walks away. I mistakenly asked for another side of avocado because the three tiny slices provided were not enough for these avocado lovin' gals. Wrong. Another 10 minutes goes by, we were done cutting the avocado up into 463 teeny pieces to spread it on top of the omelet before I said to her as she walked by once more not noticing we were sitting there, "never mind the 'cado, we're cool..." She looked positively peeved with a semi eye roll and barked "it's coming!" Whoa, uh, okay then, I'll eat that side of avocado. It's good for your hair, skin and nails. And that's a good thing.

Good food, questionable service. Our group of 3 came on a Saturday morning ~10am (admittedly prime breakfast/brunch time). It's a small place and can get crowded easily so we were of course prepared for a wait. There were maybe 3 parties ahead of us and a party that came in after us. After waiting for about 20 minutes, the hostess seats all the other waiting parties except us, including the people who came after us! The space she sat them would have worked for our group so I was disappointed. Then once we were sitting a few groups walked in and were seated immediately! Our waitress even took another group's order before ours! Fortunately the food was good and the waitress was decently attentive once we got coffee/food so I can't disparage them too much. Probably won't come back.

And I told her that I didn't want the pancakes that come with the Roxanne grande breakfast instead a waffle, she said that online you could do it. Also I put that I wanted my bacon crispy. When the order got here I got no waffles and my bacon was NOT crispy. The food isn't so great tasting either. Big disappointment with not only the food but the customer service.

Right next to my hotel (Executive Hotel Vintage Court) - opted to go here for breakfast instead of waiting over an hour at Dottie's True Blue Cafe where I originally wanted to go, due to it being on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. Roxanne's was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Certainly the best breakfast sausage. I got the Roxanne Grande - 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes, served with home fried potatoes. The potatoes were among the best I've ever had. Eggs cooked perfectly (over easy). Bacon wasn't fatty, and was crispy yet chewy. I was sat immediately and service was prompt. I drank a pomegranate mimosa which was exactly what I needed to buzz me up for an afternoon of hilly walks. Pancakes were nothing special but not terrible. All in all, excellent!

Decent restaurant that appears to be targeted more towards local residents than tourists as it is a couple of blocks off of the regular tourist strips. The dining room is cozy and the service was quick and efficient. I had the New York steak for dinner and my companion had the salmon. Both were tasty and nicely prepared. I found the steam to be very tender but a bit lacking in the natural beef flavours as it was covered in gravy. The salmon was almost perfectly cooked and very tender. The sides of steamed vegetables were very simple but complimented the meals nicely. Overall a good experience and I would definitely return. Prices were also very reasonable.

My husband had the flank steak, it was so tough and chewy I almost choked on a piece...don't get that. Mashed potatoes were very good and the steamed vegetables were nice and crisp. Nothing special. Lots of better places to eat.

On Saturday morning there is not much you desire to eat, especially after drowsy Friday night. I had the idea of starting the day with blueberry pancakes but I have eventually settled on eggs benedict.They have plenty of breakfast options with different variations of pancakes, eggs and their specialities. You can try for instance ground meet hash with eggs and potatoes. Quite heavy for breakfast in my opinion but it allows you to skip lunch or at least postpone it till a late afternoon.I would definitely try to return to check out their pancakes. The location is so convenient that it makes total sense to walk up a bit Powell St to escape from touristy hassle of Union Sq and Market.
