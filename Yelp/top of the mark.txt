Go for the beautiful view! I didn't have a problem with the service and thought the pricing was fair. The food wasn't anything special but was fine. We had a nice romantic dinner and they had a band playing Motown after dinner which was a blast! Overall glad we went.

The view was fantastic, the food was amazing and the drinks were well done.The only reason for the 2 stars was the treatment of my family by the manager, who would not let my wife walk in to see the view from the lounge while we were waiting, but let a party of 4 come in and take photos.Likewise, there was a long wait. Many people were sitting on the stairwell. When my son sat there, the manager sent security to tell him not to sit.For some reason, the manager & security treated my family rude, but not others. Very strange behavior for such a well known place.

Breathtaking and classy all the way! We enjoyed some of the special craft cocktail menu items. We rode the elevator to the top of the Mark Hopkins on Nob Hill and waited maybe ten minutes for a table. There is no cover charge and you can order just drinks or drinks and appetizers while you overlook the entire city. Order the crab nachos! We also enjoyed the Daylight and the Holly Go Lightly. Try it, you must!

The view is quite breathtaking. But the food and drinks are overpriced and don't expect real tapas because as I recall there's nothing remotely Spanish about the small dishes. There were few vegetarian options; it's more pub food.

If there is ever a clear day, Top of The Mark is definitely the place to stop by. But, that's like, what, 25% of the time? Thanks, Karl! I was in the 75% of weather conditions when I came for some night time drinks. It was 7 and cloudy AF. And for some reason, it was also extremely dark inside, which didn't make the atmosphere any less gloomy looking. There was a slight wait and it seems to be a pretty popular tourist destination. The walk up the hill was excruciating-worked out enough for the week. The drinks are super pricey, average $15-18? I got a negroni and that's on the lower end of the price range. It was an okay negroni. The tapas are really what gives Top of the Mark it's 3 dollar signs. It was nearly $30 for the crab nachos and it wasn't even that great. Finished barely half and called it a day. Service was average. Maybe I'll be able to appreciate this place more when I come during good weather conditions but I also know of several other places that have just as good a view with better food and drinks. It's nice to try once. But stick to ordering a drink.

Only reason this place is getting 3 stars is because of the view or else I would give it 2 stars. The drinks are super strong and kind of taste weird. I've had their cocktails a few times and it's probably one of the worst for the price in San Francisco. In addition the server didn't write down our order of an appetizer so obviously that was forgotten and never delivered. Bad service, bad drinks, old ambience, but nice date view. It's a place you can enjoy once or twice but I wouldn't go there for the drinks.

Best view in all of SF no questions.drinks are a little pricey (but not really).we got to the mark and saw a line of people down in the lobby (the top doesn't open till 5pm) plan accordingly.... but the elevator (thats on a timer) will let people up about 2 minutes before but even once on the top floor you will not be seated (doors aren't even open). my group was first in and we were seated by best view first (enter to the right and sit), youll see everything including a little piece of the golden gate bridge.THIS IS A SAN FRANCISCO MUST and will impress your date....panty - dropper.

Wow is all I can say when it comes to the view here at Top of the mark! A friend and I came here for high tea earlier this week and had a great time. We got seated right by the window and had spectacular views of the city. When we arrived to our table, there was lemon and strawberry curd & clotted cream on the table. We ordered a glass of champagne and then our 3 tier of snacks came over. There was a plate full of scone, little cakes/tarts and tea sandwiches. My favorite was this green log cake, it was delicious! There was a wide variety of teas to choose from, my friend & I both went for English breakfast which was great. The price for holiday tea was $55 + $10 if you choose to get champagne. Worth the price for the view!

I came for a martini around sunset on a Friday night and loved it! I went with my boyfriend and my best friend and we waited 5 minutes tops on Friday at a 6 pm. Found their martinis to be very well done with the perfect amount of alcohol to get you feeling happy! Pair it with the view and it was truly beautiful. I thought pricing was fair for what it is and will definitely be back

Great views. A perfect and iconic place to take an out of town guest, or when you just need a dose of an expensive drink and some San Francisco.You enter in the iconic and beautiful Intercontintal, take the elevator up to the top and enjoy.It's a circular room, with floor to ceiling windows, so ample space to get those front row seats. And again, those views: Bay Bridge, Golden Gate, Alcatraz, the Bay, Transamerica Pyramid, and the city below. Swoon worthy.The martinis and $15 a pop are real strong, so you do get your money's worth. Pro-tip: Don't guzzle three like I did. A great spot to take it all in and be fancy.

Nice place on the top of nob hill. A bit of a climb if you are walking so make sure you don't get winded too easily. Went on a Friday night, they had live music which was nice but was really loud and not the atmosphere we were looking for. If you want to dance then this is your place! They charged a $10 cover, but it is waived if you are staying at the hotel. Drinks were just ok, a little bit on the sugary side. Service was good and great views!

Absolutely stunning view of the bay and amazing atmosphere but the food was extremely underwhelming for the price.Ended up paying 60$ for two different foods and the portions are definitely not big enough to fill you up.Crab nachos, ~27$, 7/10 the portion for this order was much better than the next one, crab taste was average, there was not enough guacamole, however the cheese and rest of the ingredients was decent, bang average for nachos and definitely not worth the price tag. Nothing special, as seen from pic the plate didn't look the most appetizing either.Grilled octopus, ~25, 5/10 extremely overpriced as seen from pic the portion is extremely fresh, the octopus was average taste, hummus was pretty good but it came with very little of it and only 4 pita breads, also not memorable. Service was below average, however if you come just for drinks than it's a great place especially with the stunning view and nice music. Don't overpay for the food though.

This is by far the BEST brunch of all times!!! I have been to the Plaza in NY and I can assure you that this blows that out of the water and into the universe. The selections offered were unbelievable from eggs to caviar, salads galore, seafood abounding, lamb chops with polenta, sea bass, chicken,.... and the list goes on and on!!!!And talk about service... attentive, friendly, helpful...no rush at all! Any visit to San Francisco would be incomplete without the visit. BRAVO Top of the Mark and ```Thank You``` Grace M

We finally got a chance to visit this landmark for a drink. It was a clear day and the views were awesome. It can get a little bit loud depending the the crowd and how full the room is. We enjoyed a few drinks and some octopus appetizer. The drinks were very nice. The octopus appetizer was really terrific. And the views again were amazing. It's a special place to check out at least once.

We've stopped here for a drink and to enjoy the view. The cocktails were great and the bartender very attentive. I cannot speak to the food but have seen more people here on a date with just a drink rather than a meal. Overall a very nice visit in a quaint atmosphere and the view over the city is stunning. I recommend going here for the sunset or at night.

Drinks were great but the service was terrible. It took an hour to only get one round because the server couldn't be bothered.

My wife and I went there for a sunset cocktail on Saturday evening. The host, Brian, gave us a fantastic seat by the window. I told him we had reservations for Sunday brunch at 10:30am the next day. He told us he was working the next morning and would take care of us. Sure enough... when we arrived, he and another host welcomed us like family and sat us at the best seat in the house by the window. Everything we ate from the buffet was fantastic! The best Eggs Benedict, the most tender prime rib, delicious desserts, etc... Our waiter, Robert, kept the champagne flowing for the entire 2 hours we stayed there (and no... nobody gave us "stink eye" for hogging our window table for 2 hours). The only thing better than the food was the remarkable staff. Yes, it's pricey... but it was a dining experience we'll never forget.Oh yeah... the view???? Amaaaaazing!We'll be back!

I was staying at the hotel with my bf so we tried this bar out of course. It was ok. This place stays alive because of the views of the city. Not really impressed with the drinks and definitely not the food. I tried their crab nachos and they were not cheesy and not flavorful at all especially for the price. They don't even try on their menu. Come here for a drink and views and that's all. Don't expect much.

So the location and view are amazing, siting on the top of the Mark hotel (intercontinental hotel) in Nob Hill. I recommend a day time dining as the view is much better during the day for this pretty city. The image this place attempts to give out is one of an upper end; however I noticed many guests wearing shorts, very casual tops, and a mixed bag. The table next to us had a family of 4, playing cards on the table!!!!I don't mind paying a lot for good food, however their overpriced menu items reliever well below average quality food. For example, their cheese plate (which hardly has any cheese in it), comes with a basket of cold and generic one flavored toast bread. Exactly the type of bread you would pick up from your local super market.

We did not have a good experience here... and glad we left immediately. We visited sf in June and were staying at the fairmont across the street. When we asked for an ice high class lounge they recommended this place to us. We went to dinner and came here after. We arrived around 10pm, there was a line and a wierd band playing. The guy at the front was super strict, super rude and a$$hole. There was a cover charge and my husband didn't know if we should stay here considering the music really sucked and the tables all looked occupied. I needed to use the restroom and I asked the guy if I could go in to use the restroom and my husband can stay behind (keep in mind I was pregnant) he refused to let me use the restroom or see if there is room for us to sit if we were to go in. He talked with such bad and rude manners that I could not and would not ever spend my money there. Very unexpected from a "high end" hotel and bar. We ended up going to thenrooftop of the Marriott and it was gorgeous! So glad we moved locations

The only reason this gets 3 stars is the view... can't beat it. I expected to pay through my nose for drinks and appetizers, and wouldn't resent a bit of it if the drinks were half decent. Mixed drinks were pricey, tiny, and poorly prepared. And we had what was supposed to be dungeness crab nachos which was extremely light on the crab and otherwise quite boring.I'd still go back there again for the view. Buyer beware.

The view here is worth coming for. I came right before sunset during the holidays, and was not disappointed. There was a long line in the lobby of the InterContinental but when we got up there we were seated immediately at a table near the window. They do a great job of corraling folks in line and ensuring a good experience at the top. The service was great, our server polite and willing to wait for us to make our drink choices. I ordered a mojito and brother a whiskey sour. Both came promptly and tasted great! Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great vantage point to see the city and the bay.

We went for late night drinks after a show, and the view was mesmerizing. The cocktails were well made though a bit pricey, as you'd expect with the location and view. Our waitress was friendly and efficient, and I actually appreciated the fact that she was older and slightlyround-- did not fit the mold of the trendy hot 20-something year old you might expect in these surroundings.The only thing I'd mark them down on was the wait to get seated. We stood at the desk for several minutes, and when the hostess arrived she said it would be another 5-10 before we could be seated. When she sat us, it was obvious that our seat had been available that whole time (no one had left while we stood around waiting), so it seemed like a ploy to make us appreciate our good fortune at being able to get in there (but unnecessary!)

Went here for tapas night after checking out from the hotel. Perhaps when they have live entertainment their prices make more sense. My husband got a glass of wine for like 14$, and we ordered the in house-made chips with buttermilk dressing $7 and burrata/prosciutto toasts. I didn't see cider on the menu but the menu is super long so I wasn't sure if I missed it, so I asked the waiter if they had cider and he said yes. So I am expecting hard cider (the place is pretty much a bar) and instead I got a small glass of martinelli's for 7$. The only thing here that was worth trying was the burrata/prosciutto app and even that was overpriced. People talk about the "great view" but it's just a view of buildings, perhaps it looks nicer when the city is lit up at night.

The views are spectacular and the cocktails are above average, but the manager/host there kind of ruined the magic. I went in late with my wife on the first night of our honeymoon, and asked to be seated by the windows. The host said that all window seats were taken but we could take a different table if I wanted -- I said sure, but asked if we could switch once a window table opened up. He said yes. Well, after watching 3 tables empty out and then get filled immediately by the host without telling us, I went up and asked him why he wasn't letting us move to a window seat. He said that they actually decided they couldn't switch us because it would "mess up the servers," but for some reason hadn't decided to let us know...Beautiful location in a historic building, but the service doesn't live up to that...

Top Of The Mark is on mark for its spectacular view. As soon I get out of the elevator on the 17th floor, I hear the live band playing 80s music. The energy was overwhelming. The first noticeable feature of this lounge is the windows that almost wraps around the entire room. It offers an incredible view of the different parts of San Francisco. The bar is a little small but the drinks are pretty good. They have a pretty large dance floor and many tables and seats wrapped around the room. It's a romantic place to be. I can imagine this place being really packed on New Year's Eve. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the view the most. I probably won't be back here but it was a great once in a lifetime experience not worth missing.

If spectacular views of this amazing city is what you're looking for, Top of the Mark is the place to go. I wouldn't say this is one of those "eh" places but I did feel it was a tad overrated. I did not go for dinner so I am strictly reviewing their bar. I can say that their martini menu is impressive and they do make a great martini no matter which one you choose but nothing I drank left me with the desire to go back. I enjoyed the breathtaking views and strong martini but other than that, it's one of your typical-fancy restaurants in a big city that seems more like a tourist attraction.

The guy and I dropped by Top of the Mark prior to dinner in the area, and I'm baffled that our experience wasn't as fabulous as many other Yelpers seem to have had.THE OVERVIEW.- You pack into the narrow elevators after passing through the gorgeous lobby- You can either opt to be herded into the long line of people waiting for a window seat, or be seated elsewhere without a wait- The drink menu is extensive, but the cocktails are poorly executed and expensiveThe appeal here seems to be primarily the view and nothing more. Don't get me wrong, the view is fantastic, but I'm not eager to wait an hour+ to sit next to a window.

My friend who was hosting me suggested we go here when we learned the Tonga Room across the way at the Fairmont was closed and I'm glad I didn't object. We snagged a coveted corner seat by the bar and enjoyed a few well made martinis and the poke. The menu is simple and pricey, but when on vacation you're allowed to treat yourself. The service was also top notch, we didn't feel hurried or pressured to order more while we enjoyed ourselves. Take as many pictures as you can--we lucked out and arrived in the early afternoon and caught the sunset and then got to see all the city lights come on. Would love to visit again!

A restaurant/bar with a million dollar view of the city! Keep in mind you are paying for the spectacular view and not the food. Having said that, the cocktails and the cheese platter we ordered were decent and our waiter was very courteous and sweet. Not the best, but like I said, the view is the restaurant's specialty. We went on a Saturday night around 8:00 PM and had to wait a good 20-25 minutes to get a table. I don't believe they accept reservations, so get there early to avoid the crowd and the cover charge on nights they have a live band playing. The place is classy, a good excuse to wear the pretty black dress that you typically don't get to wear in the forever dress down SFO. Great view, classy, good food-what's not to like about Top Of The Mark!

Came here for a girlfriend's birthday, couldn't have been happier with our decision!Had many a drink (key lime pie martinis were WAY too good. Like WAY TOO GOOD) and had a blast dancing to the live Jazz music. Had a pour of Moet champagne on the house for the celebration which just made our night even better.Great staff, awesome venue, gorgeous views, bomb music, and amaze-balls (am I allowed to say that here?) drinks. Top of the Mark hits the top marks in my review book.

This is one of the famous spots in the City. I've been coming here for at least 15 years and my Father came here in the 50s. The view is great and one of the better places to dance. The bands are generally very good, although sometimes the place can get pretty loud so I always bring ear plugs.

Went for drinks. Nice view. Some wait and a $10 cover after 8pm. Live music was pretty nice, but the crowd is...interesting. Mostly old people (or old people with really young women). Cocktails were okay, pretty pricey. Basically nothing "wowed" me.

Tourist trap. Very pretentious and bad service. We arrived on Thursday night, were told there's $10 cover. Fine, we keep waiting. One if the guys keeps trying to push everyone to "stand behind the line". Come on, this feels like a cheap night club. We left without getting drinks. There are better rooftop bars in the city.

I, a senior, was denied admittance to the Top of the Mark's free "Wind Down with Wine & a Movie" night on June 13. The reason given was that the event was full. Many tables of 3-5 were in plain view, none fully occupied. Nor was there a wait list or wait line to be seen. When I persisted, a second staff member responded with a curt no. If the management sends out invitations to the public, it should honor them. If the wait staff doesn't like to accommodate patrons who show up for free events, it's better that there be no free events. Perhaps the Mark Hopkins should consider changing its address from 1 Nob Hill to 1 Snob Hill.

Great place with amazing views of the city. For dinner I recommend you to call ahead and make a reservation. It gets busy here especially on weekends and holidays. Service was great and waiter very polite. Again the views are already worth coming here, no matter if you are a local or tourist.For better parking rates, park at the parking garage a half block down on California st.

Came here for drinks with friends. Honestly, it was overpriced and mediocre with minimal service. I expected the drinks to be "meh" but I expected better service. I think there was one waitress for the entire place, we hardly saw her. And the view might have mitigated our bland experience but it was super foggy and we couldn't see anything. Not sure if I'll be back, but if I do, I'll have to lower my expectations.
