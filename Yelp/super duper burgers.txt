If you're going to call yourself "Super Duper", you're going to have to back it up. Super Burger? Maybe... Duper Burger? Probably. Super Duper Burger. I don't think so. I got their double burger with all the fixings, minus onions (because raw onions are gross). I also got their fries with the overpriced three dipping sauces. Everything was really greasy. Super duper greasy. As for flavor, the burger was too meaty (next time, stick to the single patty). The bun seemed flimsy, and the whole thing appeared on the brink of collapsing from the first bite, but never actually did. Not sure if that's saying something about the burger or my ability to hold it together, but there it is. The fries were disappointing. Greasy, luke warm and limp. Flavor-wise they were fine, but fries are two parts flavor, one part texture, and the texture was off. Plus the sauces were not worth the extra expense (mayonnaise, by itself should not be a "sauce" that you charge extra for). Overall, slightly better than a fast food burger (Burger King, Wendy's, etc.) but also more expensive and therefore more disappointing.

We got takeout from here for our game of thrones watch party. I'm gluten free so I ordered a chicken sandwich without the bread. It was good! It didn't blow my mind, but I would order it again.We also ordered the fries and I asked for it with the cheese, I thought it was a better option than getting the sauces for extra $$.They also provide free picked which was really good and also their ketchup and mustard are good quality!Would definitely come back when I need a chicken sandwich fix:). It would be even better if they offered a gf option bread, but I won't hold my breath.

Wow, what a moneymaker, Fast Company cover in two years! Located on the main drag of Chestnut Street, this location, one of 10 now operating in the Bay Area, serves up super duper juicy burgers done just right.Served medium well and offered in two sizes (the 4 oz patty or two patties for a double decker burger), pick your size, add bacon, cheese or avocado (the rest of the fixins like special sauce, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions on request) you order and pay at the register and grab your drinks at the self-serve soda station.Seat yourself and soon your wax paper-wrapped bundle of greasy heaven arrives. Boy is it good!They have fries, milkshakes, lemonade, ice tea, "the usual suspects" sodas plus beer on tap.A steady line queued up in constant streams and was quickly cleared with people seated without waiting and served quickly afterward.Super Duper has got their system down: The menu is simple and the service is partially self-serve and very streamlined. Service is expedient and friendly and prices are reasonable and in line with their quality, grass-fed angus beef (or chicken- they have chicken sandwiches too).They're in the FiDi, the Mission, Castro, San Jose, Los Gatos, Novato and Mill Valley. I wish this vibrant, growing restaurant group all success: They have a great product and know how to execute with superior customer service.A++

Friday, June 2nd, 2017. National doughnut day.A lovely coworker decided to get the office two dozen donuts to celebrate the day. I walked in around 9am to the yummy surprise. She got all three mini donut flavors: Chocolate glaze, Cinnamon sugar, Sugar glaze. Being the glutton I am, I had one of each! My favorite was the cinnamon sugar. Reminded me of churros which I adore. Especially when still warm since it's crispy on the outside and soft inside. The other two were good as well. Even though I'm not big on chocolate, the donut didn't have a super thick glaze, so I didn't mind.Fun way to celebrate national donut day. Even though I ate three doughnuts, they were mini, so I shouldn't feel guilty right? They can't be that many calories! Seriously, I do enjoy the donuts from Super Duper as I've had them on many occasions. I may be back to try the burgers at this location.

Pickles...all the pickles you want, that's my kind of burger spot!We stopped in for a cookies and cream milk shake and it did not disappoint. I have previously had their burgers at a different location and I really admire their hand made patties and perfectly seasoned burgers. The staff at this location weren't the most friendly and were giggling to each other while we stood and waited to place out order, not a huge deal but there is room for improvement.

I didn't think a fast food place would have good burgers but let me tell you about this juicy patty! The meat was high quality with just the right amount of fat. There is no additives to firm up the patty. When you bite into it, it just kinda falls apart in your mouth. Way better than any $13+ restaurant burger!The strawberry milkshake was amazing! Then you spike it with some booze and it'll complete your night. Now it's not a lot of alcohol so don't expect to get buzzed from it.The garlic fried are so aroma-full...i know it's not a word but it definitely will scare off vampires. Loaded with a lot of cheese. Can't wait to come back or find one closer to me!

I'm a fan! A little pricey for a burger that size (similar to Five Guys, but more expensive), but the taste and juiciness is real! If I could summarize Super Duper in one sentence: "It's what a burger should taste like." I recommend getting the super size (two patties). Oh, and the garlic fries are pretty good too. Definitely prefer those over the regular fries. They're $3.50.The only thing that was off, was that they put my friend's receipt in the sauce on his bun...uuummm wtf? -___-

So there are a couple of these in the city - this one is next to the Tipsy Pig... I go in during an odd weeknight on a rainy evening an hour before closing time.My first time. I'm greeted with high ceilings, some woodwork, two counter/bar areas - one with a view out the window the other toward the grill. Toward the back are tables for large groups.Music plays just loud enough to keep anybody over 40 years old out. Tourists, regulars and bar goers are here. I order the smaller burger combo. Grab a self serve soda as I wait. Although I didn't try it I noticed a real ice tea option. That is something I would normally drink so I appreciated that - I just wanted the sugary cola this night.The place has few patrons so I get my burger super fast. Its different - this is no Nations burger. The bun has a little something substantial that you can bite into... but still... you could give this to grandma and her dentures wouldn't pop out. Don't worry about though - remember the music a touch louder than what people over 40 would care to hear? She wouldn't be in here anyway.The meat itself was juicy just as expected. It was cooked just perfectly too. I didn't make any special requests and it had a touch of pink - beautifully done... not cooked to death.The ketchup had a different flavor from the normal Heinz. Neither good nor bad. Just different. The sauce on the burger different too.... I wish I had tried one of their homemade pickles... the whole theme with this burger spot was that its unique and great.I see people here on Sunday mornings under the covered patio. Probably a great alternative to waiting for 2 hours at Mommas for weekend brunch. Would like to try their breakfast.Again, for the time I went and what I ordered 5 stars easily. The 2-3 guys working top notch. Squeeky clean bathroom. Excellent value, especially for this neighborhood. I'm sure even during a busy time the guys working here would push out food in as timely a manner as possible and you can grab a beer while you wait.If your a senior bring some ear plugs :)

My boyfriend and I came here after spending a day at the Palace of Fine Arts. We had been once before, but had had very high expectations after our friends told us Super Duper had the best burgers they had ever tasted. We left a little disappointed. This time, our expectations were set somewhat lower, but our satisfaction was much much higher! We each ordered the Super Duper and fries. The burgers were great! They were made right in front of us (cool restaurant setup) and were served to us fresh off the grill. The burgers were juicy, filling, reasonably priced, and had a really good flavor.The fries were not as good-- just fried frozen potatoes. They're the reason I'm holding back that fifth star; they were alright, but didn't quite match the quality of the burgers. I'm really glad we gave this place another try. The burgers were amazing and I'm excited for Super Duper to open a location in Berkeley, hopefully with fresh fries ;-)

As a person who absolutely loves burgers and is picky as hell, I was eager to try Super Duper Burgers after my friend hyped it up so much. The location was really nice and there was adequate parking, so right from the start, the experience was nice. The cashier was really friendly when we ordered and did a good job selling me on the 4 cheese burger and I never order cheeseburgers.Man, my burger was pretty delicious. The cheese just oozed out of it, although the bleu cheese made me a bit sick since I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, but it was still quite enjoyable. I really enjoyed all of the flavors and the juiciness of the burger. It was just right. The fries were really good fresh out of the fryer too. The whole thing was a bit messy but well worth it. Highly recommend!

The place is small but it is lively and they have an outdoor patio. My family and I can see the cooks do their creation on their burgers. It was very fun to watch while were waiting. I don't how long our orders got here but there were 5 orders and it felt it came in just 5 minutes or so. I got normal French fries which was amazing because it was not too salty but it had a little bit of salt. Felt like I got the right kind of French fries I wanted. My choices for my burger is a super burger with cheese with lettuce, red onions, and tomatoes with a finishing touch of an organic egg. This was the best lunch I ever had that day. When I ate the burger, it felt like melted in my mouth. I applaud to those who worked so hard that they to give the best food and service. Thank you and I hope to visit again in another time!Sorry, trying to get my photo on.

If you've read my last review of Super Duper you'll know that I'm definitely a fan of their burgers and the consistency behind them. What I didn't know until this past weekend is that they serve breakfast sandwiches too. Amazing. I was on my way to a completely different restaurant on Saturday when I saw the breakfast sandwich menu which stopped me in my tracks. I'm a sucker for an english muffin sandwich and wasn't terribly hungry so, this was a perfect stop. The menu has three different combos where are all super reasonably priced ($5, $6, $7) and they all include a cup of four barrel coffee. I mean, brilliant. Our local chain of burgers (Super Duper) has partnered with my favorite coffee roaster on planet earth...mind blown. Pro tip: The cup of coffee is only $2.25 making it the cheapest/best cup of coffee in the Marina. On to the sandwich. Nothing crazy, pretty basic but, fresh and flavorful. You can customize it to your liking and I opted for bacon and avocado which were solid choices. I opted out of the donut that comes with most of the combo meals and that was a huge mistake. Needless to say I'll totally be back for the combo soon.

I don't understand how everyone here has not been fired. 83% of the time I order here, possibly more, they get my order wrong. Then, they don't answer the phone, so I can't complain. My order is simple: burger with cheese, no tomatoes and no sauce, and burger with cheese and no onions. How is it so hard to get that right? I have gotten every combination. It's like the cooks just make what they feel like, throw it in the bag, and hope no one comes all the way back in to complain in person. Tonight, the guy taking the order EXPLICITLY asked me if I wanted cheese. I said yes. I get home, and no cheese! Every other location has competent employees. Please have this one join the party. Your burgers are great, but the service just plain sucks.

One of my favorite places to get a burger! Consistently high quality and delicious.I got the super burger with cheese ($8.50). It has this amazing super sauce on it and the meat is so juicy and savory. They also sell mini burgers ($6 w/ cheese) with only one patty instead of two which might be a better option if you're not as hungry. I'm a huge fan of their garlic fries ($3.25) that are completely covered with garlic and cheese. It's up there with some of the best fries I've ever had. I also got their vanilla ice cream dipped cone ($4) which was coated with a thick layer of chocolate. Overall if you're craving a burger in the Marina, this is the place to go! It's not as cheap as In-N-Out but the quality is well worth it.

I ate here for the first time after running the San Francisco marathon on July 23rd. I loved everything about it, and it was the perfect lunch for after the race!Everything is organic, and I'm pretty sure this place had one of the best veggie burgers in the city. The sauce they put on it is so good! The milkshakes are also amazing. I only noticed after I ordered that you could get them spiked, and I'll definitely be doing that next time!

Very well assembled, very tasty burger, lots of cheese on it and the fries were cooked perfectly. A limited choice of beers, but they had beer and really, that's what counts. After all this walking, I needed it!The joint is just too small for the crowds here. I was fortunate to get a good table outside under the awning which was helpful.

Boyfriend and I decided to try this place after bickering about how he thinks Habit is better when he did not even try Super Duper!I have tried Super Duper a multiple times, but the only thing stopping me from coming here too often is that I think it is a bit pricey for a small burger. However, the burger is sooo yummy! Their patty tastes so good and it's super juicy. Fries are ok but yet again, pricey.I would give it a 4 star but it's a 3 because I asked one of the girl for a side of ranch and when she tried to hand it to me, she spilled it on her finger, and accidentally dipped a small part of her finger in it...and had the audacity to ask me if it's ok or if I want a new side of ranch.... I was like...?????!!!!! FOREAL?She ended up giving me a new side of ranch because I was grossed out about it but cmon... did you really have to ask me that..? Now I can't stop thinking about what they do with other food if they ever drop it or something...hm

I'll preface this by saying that I've eaten burgers touted the 'best' in SF. I've even paid upwards of $25 after tax and mandate for some. This is easily the best I've had and it costs me $8.75 for a super double cheese with the works. I simply won't get a burger anywhere else. For the money, you just can't beat it. Game over, you're f*$ing out, other burger joints.

Nothing beats ending the work week with awesome burgers at Super Duper. I went here a few nights ago on Monday night (my "friday") and the burgers were particularly salty in an extremely tasteful way. I got the Super Duper special - comes with 2 patty burger (they're small in-n-out type patties), fries, and upgraded to Racer 5 on tap. I love that these burgers are really reasonable in price and so tasty. They always satisfy my burger craving. And the Racer 5 on tap just really puts the cherry on top!GOOD BURGERS HERE!

I'VE NEVER HAD A SUPER DUPER BEFORE.. there is one location at a food court in San Jose, but I was skeptical of it. My cousins have pointed it out the last time I was in the Marina. It was so good. I loved the bun, it isn't like a typical bun from IN-N-OUT (typical but soggy, even though I love it there), or FIVE GUYS (typical), this had a bit of crisp and oomph to it. Now the cashier was totally sweet and genuine and whether he is paid or not: at least he doesn't make up stuff (like at Smitten to get a tip), so I tipped and I came here first. He was super nice and helpful: totally good vibes.I got the mini burger which is the right size for high cholesterol. I got Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions (everything on the left side anyways), and avocado for $1. The avocado wasn't cold, it was warm: it was good, but not what I'm used to be honest.But I would definitely do a do-over here again.

This was the second super duper location I've been too. Not sure if it's a franchise or individually owned but this location is definitely not as good as other locations. The reason for my rating is.... although there is a line and staff standing around they wouldn't start another register for a while. Fries came out cold and bland. They're busy enough to keep putting in new batches into the fryer yet they fry them and let them sit. They tried to give me a glass for water than looked dirty. Ask for a to go cup instead. They got an extra star for making me a custom milkshake. Happy about that If you want a burger go to nearby Umami Burger. You'll be happier.

This place is my typical go-to burger joint when I am in SF, particularly in Marina. It always has a line when I come in, but that can only tell you that the food is amazing. The seating isn't a lot, but I seem to always score a spot so I can't really say I've been forced to wait for a spot (there's also some seating outside). I like the environment, and I also like how the kitchen is open and you can pretty much see everything being cooked in front of you. It is a bit pricy, but it's understandable for this type of food, and also the fact of where it is located )The Marina is a very well-off area of SF). Parking may be difficult since Chestnut is the main food drag, but I always suggest people should park a few blocks north where you can park without a permit during the weekend (or for 2 hours during the the day).The burgers here are so juicy and delightful; will continue to patronize this place as long as they keep up the good quality & service.

The burgers are oh-so-delicious and fresh, the fries (daughter and I love the garlic) are amazing, and if you're feeling particularly cheeky the Strauss Creamery milkshakes are a real treat or they have beer on tap (they have hubby's fave Racer 5).This location is one of our favorites since it's the gateway to Marin and closer to the Marina. Cow Hollow is a great neighborhood with lots of shops and eateries. One of my favorites is burger here then Books Inc. It's also a perfect jumping off point trips for the Marin Headlands. The staff is friendly as with all SDB's. The only drawback is it's a small location, but we've always managed to find a place to sit.

The burgers aren't very large, but they taste amazing. The sides are pretty great as well, especially the fries and pickles.

If you love a good burger, and I know you do, you will love Super Duper. We plan trips to SF around getting one. Premium quality meat and everything else. House made pickles. You can pay a lot more for a burger that's half as good as these. Potato and sweet potato fries are the thinner kind and are always crisp and delicious. The milk shakes are first rate and they have a small but quality selection of micro brews on tap. Basically all you could need or want.

The garlic game is real here. Be forewarned, if you get the garlic fries, there isn't garlic salt on the fries. There isn't little bits of garlic nicely cooked and seasoned on the fries. There is raw, grated, unforgiving garlic on them.I happen to like garlic, a lot. So I didn't mind, but there was one bite where I thought I got a little garlic and some cheese and it ended up being only garlic. Oh and my girlfriend woke up with garlic breath the morning after even when she brushed her teeth before bed. Yikes. The regular fries were dope. Fresh. Delicious.The burgers were pretty awesome as well. I made the mistake of adding a fried egg on top and that made it pretty unmanageable to eat cleanly (but they do warn you of that on the menu!). Also, don't shy away from the aioli, it's killer!

Oh man, awesome burger. Juicy and delicious, great with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and their super sauce. Fries well cooked but not spectacular. Not cheap, but well worth the money. They serve chicken, veggie burgers, and salad for the non- carnivores.

Food - 4 starscleanliness - 1 star... because they bus the table for you. Delicious food, every time! Moist patties, fresh ingredients, and I just can't resist that egg on top of my burger! Thank you for separating the top bun from the rest of my burger pile for me, I appreciate you not breaking the yolk! The place is small and can get very noisy. Little wiggle room. Tables are bus'ed by staff, but they don't clean the tables very well :( there were trash all over the sticky floor. One would think that the reason they bus the table for customers is to make sure the space gets cleaned properly... Lastly, the bathroom was a mess...

I went to super duper burger after a long walk through Sam Francisco and got the "super combo" for $12 plus tax. It came with fries, a burger and a drink. This was plenty for me although I wasn't especially hungry.The fries were OK. They were cut thin but not as thin as say McDonald's. They weren't as salty as most but that was easily remedied with ketchup and the sachets of salt in the store. I liked eating them but I wasn't impressed -- they were of completely standard quality.The burger on the other hand was fantastic. The vegetables on it were fresh and in just the right ratios. The red onion was especially good. The patties were tasty and extremely juicy, so juicy that the toasted bun was pretty soaked on the bottom. This made for a delicious but very greasy burger. This great burger had two flaws. First and most importantly, the sauce wasn't quite as flavourful as it could have been. The flavour it did have was very nice and added a little complexity to the taste, but it wasn't very strong. I added ketchup to my burger to make it a bit flavourful. The other quibble I had was that I had to manually add pickles to my burger. The pickles were scrumptious and really improved the burger. My complaint is that I'm sure there are customers missing out on this because they don't realise there are pickles in the store.The drink was just a standard fountain drink. I wanted root beer but they didn't have a very expansive selection at the fountain so I got coke zero. Oh well.All in all, it was a great meal let down slightly by the somewhat forgettable fries. I highly recommend super duper burger's "super combo" for lunch or a very casual dinner.

I feel a little bad in saying that I really wasn't feeling Super Duper.. don't hate me. Firstly, my Husband and I were overcharged, then when we pointed it out we also realized they had got our order completely wrong and then they overcharged us again. Once we thought all was ok (expect for being charged more than we should have been which we let slide) we sat down and waited for our food only for it to arrive and find out that our order was wrong again. Whatever, we wasn't going to cause a fuss.In the end I had the smaller of the Burgers plus Cheese and my Husband the larger Burger plus Cheese and Bacon with one side of Fries to share which totaled $28 or so. The general consensus was that the Burgers really were not all that and lacked seasoning, my Husband also didn't appreciate that to have his cooked Medium was not an option, everything is well done. Everything is open plan and you can see into the Kitchen (a + for me) and seating is limited. Complimentary Pickled are located next to the Soda machine.Sadly, I doubt I will return.

They are good and rarely disappoint. Meat is good and better than Roam Burger, which is really what we are judging here. Garlic fries are good too. I'd skip the dipping sauces if you're getting it to go. They don't use romain lettuce and they use red onions instead of white onions, so the burger lacks a bit of crunch or texture that I prefer.

I went for lunch. I got a mini burger with cheese and bacon and a side of fries. It was good but not the best I've ever eaten. The menu advertises all their burgers as cooked medium, but mine was well done, maybe slightly even more than that. Also their ketchup was weird. I'd go back but hopefully it will be a little better next time.

Finally getting around to writing this review.Super packed for a rainy day, but then again it was a small store, and you get your burgers relatively quick. My friend and I sat on the counter and witnessed the patties being cooked beautifully ^^I got the Mini and deeply regretted not getting the Super Duper (which was just an extra patty I think). I added avocado and cheese and it was SO JUICY, I have dreams about it lolLoved everything about it haha

Super yummy! Burgers are made to order. Juicy and fresh. Chicken sandwich with the chipotle aioli was delicious, but a tad spicier than I had anticipated, and I love chipotle anything. Wanted to order dipped ice cream cones to go, but their ice cream machine was down. Bummer.

This super duper burger took forever to make my food, I was in there before two and didn't get my food until 2:39 when these two young girls got their order taken and received their food within 10 minutes, highly dissatisfied with this super duper burger and their staff

This place is great.. the food is really good and service is fast at the same time I don't feel like they rushed my food.. I had a mini burger with bacon and avocado.. I was extremely satisfied. At first i thought I'd be disappointed in size . But the Mini was the same size as the super . The patty was delicious . Also the setting is very comfortable. I totally recommend this place to anyone in town for a quick bite.
