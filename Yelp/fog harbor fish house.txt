Updated review
I loved and enjoyed my experience here so much that I decided to bring my family here to give it a try. We came on a Friday evening and were given a table in less than 5 minutes (without a reservation). The staff were extremely nice (as expected) and very, very polite. The kids were handed a kids menu (priced reasonably)and ordered cheeseburgers with fries, which were mouth watering. We ordered 2 clam chowders ( 1 in a bread bowl and 1 is a regular bowl), the swordfish, chicken pasta, and fish n chips. We left over-the-top happy and satisfied with the service and our meal. This is a must-try restaurant if you come to SF.

Best thing about this place was the bread. What a bummer to be misled by so many positive reviews. We will never return. Maybe we fell into a tourist trap? We've been in the Bay Area for 2 weeks with lots of meals out and this had been the worst meal. And we ordered quite a variety.

This place was awesome! We got seated by the window overlooking the ocean. I got the clam chowder which I loved. We also got the deep fried seafood appetizers. Everything was delicious! We ended up having desert as well... the waiter brought out the dessert platter and we had to try one. We ended up getting the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream - loved the top portion lol! I'd come back here again. It is located on the second level, one of the first few restaurants you'll pass by at pier 39.

The first time I came here was when I was a young child and it's still as great as I remember. There's absolutely nothing I would complain about Fog Harbor Fish House. The food, the ambiance, the view, and the service are all impeccable. My friends and I came around dinner time so we got the opportunity to catch a view of the gorgeous sunset even though we were seated closer to the back and further away from the windows. We shared a fried calamari appetizer which came with yummy tarter sauce. We squeezed lemon all over it and our enjoyable dinner commenced. Clam chowder is a must try when you're touristing in Fisherman's Wharf. This spot truly has 'award winning' clam chowder. The clams taste as if they were just picked out of the ocean and thrown into the soup. 100% fresh. For my entree, I chose the Linguine and Clams and found it to be light yet exploding with flavor. I slurped up every single noodle loudly and proudly! (In Asian culture, eating loudly is a compliment to the food and represents how much you're enjoying it!) My only wish is that the portion was a tad bigger. Our waiter was one of a kind! One of our friends was visiting from Japan and it was his first time in San Francisco and I'm sure due to our personable waiter, he has a wonderful impression of the city.

The view and location of this restaurant was so fun and so beautiful. Loved watching the sunset over the ocean while we ate. Down side....waited forever for our food. We were a group of 7 but we waited for an hour and we were starving and then he brought my meal out wrong and didn't really do anything to make up for it. LittleAnnoyed about that. It was $19 for my burger. It was just okay. But apparently it was their "special" burger and that is a lot in my book for a "special" burger. Would I go back? No

Recommended by a friend and definitely was the perfect spot to jump start our San Francisco adventure! Our waiter was energetic and eager to get us started on the right foot. The menu stays the same regardless of lunch or dinner... although I was kinda in the mood for something "brunchy". But not to be discouraged.. I went with (well, the three of us) the clam chowder- when in Rome!! My sister and I both added the crab meat to our dishes as well. The chowder was everything we wanted and more. Full of seafood and not too heavy. Paired with their fantastic house-baked bread... I'm drooling as we speak. I would have liked slightly more options for a midday treat but overall, a great spot. And the place is huge!!

Dear Foggy,I am glad I found you. My good friend yelp let me know I should check you out, so I did.I was looking for a place to take my in-laws, somewhere nice, somewhere where the food is distinctly San-Francisco-like, and of course the food has got to be good. You hit the mark.I don't dish out 5-stars lightly, but I'll give it to you. If the prices were like $5 cheaper and the seats a little farther apart you would be perfect, but hey I understand. If I was running a business at such a prime location and brimming in the seams, I would have done exactly the same so I can't hold that against you.To keep it simple, your service good, your people are nice, and the food is fantastic. The highest compliment is that despite your prices, I've returned yet again, with my own parents some months later. We even got seated right next to the window and when that happens it's like magic. Also the wait was never as long as it seems for a place so busy. I would have expected to wait 45minutes to an hour but somehow it ends up being way short of that each time.As for the food.Mussel Fries (5/5) - um yes please. what is in that sauce? yum.Seafood Penne (4/5) - very good. I don't order pasta much because I am not a big fan of pasta so this is a high compliment. pasta lovers would have a field day.Clam Chowder (5/5) - yeah people might have different opinions but I am firmly in the camp of ... this is really good clam chowder. flavorful, little chunks of meat. Usually I leave clam chowder places wondering if they just opened a can of campbell soup. This ain't one of those.Seared Scallop Risotto (5/5) - oh yes. yes. very delicious. expensive but delicious. wish there were more scallops, but those scallops that were there... delicious. You have become our go-to place to bring people we want to take out to the city to see pier 39. great job.until then...

Nothing beats warming up with a hot bowl of clam chowder! I also ordered the Seared Ahi which was lightly seared and well seasoned. The ahi was well complimented with the rice and vegetables.

When my supervisor asked me for food suggestions for the team outing, of course I decided to go all out on seafood by the bay. It's right down the street from our entertainment, SF Dungeon.We made reservations for 5:00pm but our show ended much earlier (3:00pm). Instead of walking around or hitting a bar for 2 hours, we went to the restaurant to see if we could get seated early. When we mentioned our reservations, the lady at the front desk was all "Soooooo you came now...?" Obviously? But there were TONS of open tables. Who eats at 3:00pm??? But I bet if we actually arrived at the time of our reservations, we would've gotten a table by the window. Kinda disappointed about that but not the restaurant's fault.A coworker and I went directly up to the bar to order drinks because we wanted the drinks on a separate tab. I got the Lipstick Lemondrop and he had the Alcatraz Escape. Both were great. Couldn't taste alcohol at all but definitely felt it. I LOVE that.I got the Cioppino. At first I thought about getting the Lazy Cioppino (no shells), but part of the fun of seafood is eating with your hands! The scallops were HUGE! Do you see the chunk of white on the right of my picture?? That was one of the scallops!! The crabs were already cracked so it was easy to get the meat out. They provide the cracker and a tiny fork but I didn't need it at all. The fish they used was SALMON, my favorite! The tomato soup was DELICIOUS with chunks of tomato in it. $34 for all that? I'd say it was definitely worth it.I also tried some of my coworker's Lobster Tail, which I was also contemplating but my Cioppino was DEFINITELY the winner. The Lobster Tail was way smaller than I expected, and kinda dry. The melted butter didn't help very much with flavor.We wrapped it up with dessert. I thought the way they present dessert was VERY smart. They have all their desserts brought to you on a tray, then they introduce each one. I asked our waiter what he recommends personally and we ended up with two: House-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Strawberry Shortcake. The brulee was good, but the shortcake was better IMO. Super soft shortcake with whipped cream and fruits drowning in syrup. Not SUPER sweet either.The only thing I regret now is my coworkers knowing how much I eat...

Hmmm about this place. It's ok, if you are a tourist and want to eat at the pier by the water, but then again, there are other options, and I'd prefer Scoma at Fishermans Wharf for the parking situation.Fog Harbor Fish House - the food is very standard and mediocre, over priced of course, but that is expected. Knock off half a star.It's hard to make reservations and the lines are always so long because of tourists. They'll validate you for the garage, but only for 1 hour, which is ridiculous because the wait itself would take up a lot of that time. The garage is then $9 and hour after that. Knock off half a star.All the above can be forgiven because the view, BUT knocking off 2 stars because the service. Service was not great at all. We had reservations but was constantly reminded that the entire party had to be there, and that they would only hold our table for 15min. Our waitress was not the most attentive and served our entree and appetizers all at once (oh and the clam chowder in bread bowl last). Granted we were sharing everything among 9 people, but at least you could separate the appetizers / salads / soups and serve them first. Our table was so crowded, we didn't know where to start eating, and as we ate the appetizers, salads and soups, our entrees sat at the table getting cold.

This is probably my favorite seafood restaurant.I would definitely come back to this restaurant if I visit San Francisco once again. The lobsters were nicely cleaned and served.The food were just so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and mouth. Honestly, once you start eating you'd be pretty damn amazed. The lobster was SO juicy, highly recommend!!

This is one of our favorite local spots. It's great for a sit down dinner with friends but they also have bar seating that's first come first serve. I will say the service is MUCH better if you sit at a table. Great views & for as touristy as it is the food is killer!One of my favorite dishes is the mixed plate- comes with shrimp, sea bass and salmon. There's so much flavor & mashed potatoes & asparagus to Accompany the seafood. Their mussel fries are a MUST DO, so much deliciousness in a bowl & make sure to get extra bread to dip in the broth afterwards. We basically lick our plates clean. Other great options are the : shellfish platter, crab roll, clam chowder bread bowl & ahi.The fog house lager is really good! Try their beers

Came back again for Fleet Week and this place is still as amazing as I remembered. The mussel fries were still ah-freakin-mazing(!) and the clam chowder was really good. It was my boyfriend's first time and he was in heaven. They sat us next to the windows where the Blue Angels were putting on a spectacular show. Everything was perfect and it was a lunch to remember. Thank you Fog Harbor!

We were in San Fran for a few days and a friend recommended we have Clam chowder soup on sourdough bread. So of course I opened my Yelp app and typed in just that. So here we are!We weren't "too hungry", so the wife and I ended up ordering the clam chowder, a cocktail and wine. We thought that would be it for dinner. Well, the view was good so we stayed long enough and ordered a few more cocktails and a burger. Would HIGHLY recommend this place. Our server (Rafael from FL) was friendly and hospitable. Didn't bother us while eating, but made great recommendations and always refilled our drinks/was alert to our needs. EASY 5 STARS. Great spot if you're in fisherman's wharf!

So while in San Francisco I thought I would walk the Fishermans Wharf and check out the scene. After walking around for a while I was getting hungry. With so many choices I became flooded with indecision. But upon perusing the local listings this place caught my eye.I opted for a bar seat and was not disappointed. The bartender on duty was very polite and helpful. As I have never really been a seafood restaurant before. I was steered towards the combos to get a variety of seafood to try, and decided on getting a clam chowder cup, with a strawberry lemonade. And for my main course I got the fresh grilled combo. It comes with sword fish, salmon and shrimp.Upon receiving the strawberry lemonade, it was lightly sweet with a hint of sourness. A little watery, but ok. But the chowder was a real treat. It comes paired with a loaf of sourdough bread. The bread has got a nice soft, fluffy interior with a crunchy bite. By itself it is flavorful, and aromatic; but when dipped into the chowder itself it becomes a force to be reckoned with. When matted with a plat of butter the strong flavor of the sourness is apparent and the saltiness of the butter evens it out.The chowder is smooth and creamy. Not salty nor fishy, but got a rich milky taste to it with a strong flavor of clams. Overall it is worth the money, it would be nice to see a lobster bisque offered at a place of this caliber.Now on to the main entree, the sword fish is a nice white fish. I have never had anything other than cod and halibut before so this is new. But it is very tender and mild in flavor. A slight tuna taste to it with a buttery bite. Overall a mild fish and subdued flavor.The salmon is also extraordinarily tender, with a light crunch to the exterior. Also a light buttery taste, and more pronounced fish flavor. Which should be expected of a pink fish.And the shrimp is very good. Coming with a strong shrimp flavor, nice a fresh and hot. It has a light initial crunch, and a medium bite to it afterwards. There is a subtle butter, lemon taste to it, that compliments the shrimp flavor.The sides that came with it is sauteed veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. And I opted to get some french fries instead. The garlic mashed potatoes seems to be a fresh variant as it has lumps of potato in it. And is fairly moist and creamy. Although In my opinion it is always well paired with a country gravy to further make the texture creamy and rich. The french fries are crunchy with a fluffy interior. A little on the salty side, but again not bad.So in this honest reviewers opinion, the soup paired with the bread is fantastic, the lemonade is ok, the main entree is also fantastic, but the sides are a bit waning compared to the rest of the meal. So between the service and the attributes listed I would give it a solid 9/10 for the price class it is in. Compared to higher end restaurants could bump it down to a 7.5/10. But for the money it is well worth the time to come here.

My family and I were looking for a place to have lunch, and I insisted that we should come here based on yelp reviews and I was right. hip hip! Everything was good except that there was this not so little fly trying to kiss on my cheek!- strawberry basil nojito(non alcohol) : very sweet and fresh. I forgot to ask for little ice. It was literally full of ice that my drink was gone after two sips....:( - res chili garlic shrimp : our server warned us that it is very spicy......are you kidding me!? Not spicy at all! Booo but it was good. The plate itself was small but there were many shrimps and vegetables to share with. This was perfect with blue cheese garlic bread. - clam chowder : AWARD WINNING! No wonder! One of the best clam chowder I've ever had. But please order this with a cup or a regular bowl(not the bread bowl) and eat it with blue cheese garlic bread. I mean, unless you want to eat lots of breads...- blue cheese garlic bread : the BEST dish I had here. I love love cheese and garlic and how can you go wrong when you have them with a bread!? And if you add clam chowder here...? Heavenly! But the bread is really big, big enough to share with 3people.- lobster tail : chewy and fresh, but mashed potato and broccoli was meh :/ i ended up leaving all of them. It tasted like they didn't add any seasoning. - cioppino : I didn't get to try this but looked amazing. My husband said it's good but not amazing. I recommend you to order "lazy" one though...so that you don't need to deal with crab shells hahaOverall, it was great!

Food is pretty good, but is HEAVY. Like I still feel the clam chowder in my stomach, writing this days later. Had to knock down a star for some service issues.Due to traffic, we barely made the 10-minute cutoff for being late to our reservation. However, we sat for a good 10-15 minutes ignored by at least 3-4 staff members, including who we would find out to be our actual waitress. Just a little after opening, it was busy but not chaotic, and we got one of the last booths in the middle facing the water. However, no one stopped by to offer water or anything for these 10-15 minutes. When our waitress finally came to get our orders, she was a little sarcastic in her tone when we asked about possibly adding linguine to the cioppino, saying she had to check on it before she walked away. Ooookay? However, her attitude adjusted quickly when she came back, and was extremely accommodating and polite afterwards.As for the food, like I said, it was heavy. We order the mussel fries to start, which were quite tasty. The broth was rich, but good when you dipped it in the sourdough. I wish the fries were served on the side or something, as well as the aioli put on the side rather than drizzled on top. We couldn't squeeze the lemon on the mussels before finishing the fries first. But everything was cooked well.For my entree, I got the clam chowder and Caesar salad combo, but could barely finish half of the clam chowder. My family enjoyed the cioppino, ahi tuna, and seafood penne. I picked off their plates, and the seafood penne would be my favorite! The tomato cream sauce was hearty but not overwhelming and the dish had a lot of seafood in it. The cioppino was slightly too salty for me, but anything goes with that delicious sourdough you get for free! The sourdough isn't too sour, but has a more subtle flavor than most sourdough breads I've had in SF. Pretty good! When in doubt, DIP THE SOURDOUGH IN YOUR FOOD.

I had bookmarked this place as one of our places to eat since we were going to be visiting pier 39 to see the sea lions. We got there and were told there was about a 20 minute wait. We waited about 20 minutes and were seated. This place is huge inside. It seems like it goes on forever. And it was busy! Very good menu of seafood and none seafood items. Good kids menu as well. Our table was by the window and I could see the sea lions at pier 39 while I ate which was AMAZING! I had a ceasar salad with shrimp and my husband had the seafood medley. They also bring fresh warm sourdough bread with butter which in itself was a big win! My husband loved his dish and I did mine as well. Would definitely come back the next time we come here.

I tend to not go to restaurants with great views in touristy spots of town, as it always means the food can afford to not be top notch, but we happened to be on the Wharf and the reviews of this place were fantastic. And the setting was beautiful, the waitstaff was beyond sweet and attentive, but I am surprised at all the great reviews. The best thing we ordered was the crab cocktail. Like shrimp cocktail, but with extremely fresh lump crab meat. It's straightforward but the seafood is quality, it's worth getting.The chowder in a sourdough bread bowl was really bland. We seasoning it ourselves at the table but it still didn't hit the mark. I got the Cioppino, crab, fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels in tomato broth.The broth was also under seasoned, for the most part the seafood was good though (especially the crab, seems to be a strong choice here), just not a dish that was worth $34. The fried combo (shrimp, calamari, fish with cole slaw and fries) was totally over fried. Overall it's a nice view, overpriced, but the raw seafood is worth getting if you find yourself here.

Disclaimer: Despite the fact that this restaurant has $$$, high stars and looks nice, you can totally get away with dressing casually!! The pricing of the dishes here were definitely a bit steep. We had gotten a dozen of the raw oysters which was served with some type of vinaigrette and also cocktail sauce w/ horseradish. It was basically your typical raw oysters - it wasnt specified what type of oysters they were. $34 for 12 oysters. Ahi Tuna Poke $18 - Loved the flavors in this! It was very fresh tuna served with some chopped mangoes. I thought the mangoes were a nice touch to balance out the flavors. Great appetizer to start out our meal with.Clam Chowder w/ Crab - got the cup size to try ($7), to add crab was an additional $7, but well worth it! Had to really get that seafood experience, right? The chowder was good on its own, but the crab added an extra umph and texture. I enjoyed it. Their chowder was also rewarded best in SF! Seafood Penne $23 - The sauce for this was really favorable, but it didnt exactly "wow" me. The overall portion of the dish looked to be large, but once you get into it there was not a lot of penne within the actual dish. However, there was definitely a decent amount of seafood to compensate! For a small girl, i found that this dish was just enough for me. Alaskan Halibut $34 - This was part of their seafood menu. A bit of a disappointment. Although the fish was very soft and fresh, it lacked flavor. We are more so people who enjoy more flavor in our dishes. Had to use sauce from the pasta so the fish wouldnt be so bland. Apple Crisp $8.50 - We came here for our anniversary, so they gave us a complimentary dessert. So nice of them! At the end of your meal, the server will come out with a tray of desserts to choose from - you select the one you want and they will prepare you a new one from the back. I was silly and was about to grab it right off the tray. The Apple Crisp was delicious. Not too sweet and served with vanilla ice cream. Unfortunately, i was too full from the dinner that i couldnt finish the dessert - which never happens.For being a high rating restaurant with steep prices, I would have taken this place to be a more upscale restaurant, but its a great spot to come for any occasion at any time of the day.

Came here because of the insane amount of reviews and rating. I was no disappointed!First off, the view really makes this restaurant. If it wasn't for the view, I do not think it would be as popular as it is based off the food alone. The food was good, but in teams of seafood, there are much better places to eat.We sat at the bar and loved every second of it. The bartenders working were both awesome. Two older guys who had huge personality and top notch service. We tried a few different things off the menu, but the clam chowder was the best hands down. Even though it's not the best I've had in the city, it did a pretty damn good job. The fish I had was tasty but everything else they threw on the plate really took away from the protein itself. My roommate had lobster, which he said was incredible. The drinks we ordered were are very sweet but tasty nonetheless. The line is insane. Make sure you are prepared to wait because you will and for a while. We were really lucky to find a seat at that bar almost immediately! If not, we would have waited at least 45 minutes for 2 people.

I've had this certain problem since I was a youngster. I hate what everybody else is doing. Prefer to visit places off the beaten track. Of course, there are certain exceptions. Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf is one of those exceptions, a place I have loved since I first visited in 1975/6. During a recent trip to San Francisco/Monterey, we visited Fog Harbor twice. Once at the beginning of the trip. Once at the end.Our first visit came at the end of a long day of travel. We scored the last booth in the place, ordered a crisp white or four and a mess of sppetizers. Calamari, a spicy shrimp app. Everything was outstanding and delivered with a smile. We really enjoyed ourselves and the trip got off to a very nice start.Our second visit was on the fourth of July. Pandemonium was the name of the game. Out on the Wharf and inside the restaurant. We waited forty five minutes due to an odd snafu with Open Table that isn't worth getting into. Our table was very nice with an outstanding view of the water and passing squadrons of Brown Pelican. We ordered more nice white wine, apps, crab salad and fried shrimp. Again, everything was delicious.Midway through our meal, a family with two small children were seated next to us. While one parent played on his phone, and the other strolled around the restaurant looking to charge up her phone, the two kids screamed, blocked passers by, nearly tripped servers. One kid ran around clutching a butter knife. The little pisher then wacked my wife in the back of the head. In a perfect world, these people and their obnoxious children would have been hustled to the door and told never to return. But I'm quite sure the Cornell School for Hospitality frowns on that.A hard working manager tried to stop the insanity. I did also but alas, these folks spoke no English so the man with the purple face(me) had little to no effect. What a nice guy, that manger. Wish we could have chatted more with him in a calmer environment. A true gem.Fog Harbor provides good eats in the midst of a bustling tourist area. We like it very much.

Smacked in the middle of Pier 39, I was excited to try this place out because of the amount of reviews it has and the amazing look food. The restaurant looks super fantastic. Very high class restaurant except you don't have to be all dressed for it. There was only 3 dishes I wanted to try. That was the baked oysters, the famous clam chowder in a bread bowl, and whole dungeness crab. The baked oysters was such an awesome starter. That oyster was so freshly cooked and flavor was absolutely stunningly delicious. I wish I had 3 dozens of those. The famous clam chowder in a bread bowl. Probably the best clam chowder I have ever had. The consistency, the flavor, and the chuck of clams were great. The sour dough bread really compliments well with the clam chowder. The whole dungeness crab, I was looking really forward too. When our server came out with the crab I was shocked it was split into 2 plates. I had assume it was presented as a whole crab, but instead our server requested the kitchen staff to split into 2 plates without asking me. The presentation lost its "WOW" factor and I was super disappointed in that. Otherwise the crab was very good. Great garlic flavor. Good chunks of crab meat. Should really give this place a shot. Great seafood dishes. Except if you get a whole crab, make sure they serve it whole and not split between two plates.

Touristy, yes. Delicious, yes! This place is located in a tourist trap area but it's good and service is excellent. Prices are reasonable for the area and the views are fantastic. They also accommodate food allergies just let them know. I'm gluten free and had some adjustments made to my meal. We started with the spicy shrimp which bf said was the best thing he's had in a long time. I had the shell fish platter and bf had the fried combo. We had a reservation on open table and everything was ready for when we arrived. It highly recommend you book a table ahead of time as this area gets really crowded. Was a fantastic experience I wish we lived here so we could go back.

This is THE place to eat crab. The view is gorgeous, the service impeccable and the best crab cakes I've ever eaten. My mom and I shared: cracked dungeness crab, crab cake, a dozen fresh oysters, and a bread bowl of clam chowder with 2 iced teas with a total of 102 dollars so it's not cheap, but by far one of the most special meals I've ever had.

tl;dr surprisingly nice place for a (potential) tourist trap, platter was great, crab (cake) delicious.I am always incredibly skeptical when going to a restaurant in the middle of a tourist trap like the Pier. But sometimes people, or restaurants, surprise you, and for that I am grateful.We ordered the crab cake for appetizer, and that was too tasty and too quickly we had annihilated the plate. The seafood platter was incredible, not just simply boiled but with plenty of herbs, garlic, lemon to give it the perfect flavor which let the seafood speak for itself mostly, fresh as they are. The Dungeness crab that came with the platter was delectable.Service for such a busy place was at some point a little spotty but that's really the best you can expect, and the view was a very nice bonus to a great meal. Would come back again, though I'd skip the whole Pier part.

In SF for business trip. On my sightseeing day I went to Fisherman's Wharf to find good, reasonably priced seafood. Touristy area, more than I thought it would be, but this place seems to be the spot. Not much to say, great food, clean restaurant, reasonable prices, happy hour draft specials ($5 for local drafts), and attentive service. I sat at the bar, enjoyed the decor and view of the water, and enjoyed the ambiance. They give you crispy sourdough bread with the meal as well.

SO SO GOOD Jordan ordered the scallops and the with a balsamic risotto and said everything just melted in your mouth and was so fresh. I dived in to the garlic Dungeness crab with steamed veggies and potatoes. Everything was so great and perfectly proved my point to Jordan the Bay has the best seafood EVER! highly recommended

Beautiful spot despite being smack in the middle of the tourist hole - Pier 39. There is a wait time but was bareable considering it's a saturday. Ordered the summer special: scallop risotto, shelllfish platter made with garlic herb butter sauce w/ add on lobster tail, and their famous clam chowder w/ crab add-on.4 of 5: Great food, regret the lobster tail, and clam chowder should only be ordered with the crab addon! To die for! You can feel your blood pressure rising from the taste of fresh ocean.

This place was great! We stumbled in here after doing some sight seeing, yes it's a huge tourist place, but whatever they still have great food! The place is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be from the outside, and really had a great ambiance to the place. It was classy but not too fancy where I felt like I should have dressed up. They have a great view of the water, and the wait staff was very helpful.We got the spicy shrimp appetizer, and it definitely was spicy!! Not overbearing, but if you don't like spicy food definitely stay away. It's not one of those things on the menu that just says spicy and then there's nothing to it. My dad got the fried shrimp - which was your typical fried shrimp, nothing outstanding, but nothing bad to say. I thought they could have been a little less bread like, I hate when places drench their shrimp in batter. I got the chicken, which my dad thought was weird since we're at a seafood place, however it was fantastic! So juicy, great sauce and the mashed potatoes were fabulous. The only complaint that I have is they left the layer of fat on the chicken breast, which I understand is great for flavor, but if you're going to do so make sure you render the fat down more!Great place to go, a little pricier than some of the restaurants down there, but not outrageous!

The food was pretty good. Baked oysters were room temperature, but tasty. Clam chowder was nice and hot, a good amount of clams. Swordfish was moist and delicious, however some of the potatoes were undercooked. The Perfect Hibiscus Margarita was actually PERFECT. I'm sure you're wondering why 3 stars..well the service was nonexistent. We were not checked upon by our waiter. Not once did he ask if everything was okay. After our dinner was finished, 30 minutes went past and I had to grab the waiter's attention for the check.Side Note: I made the waiter aware that I was there celebrating my birthday. I guess they don't celebrate birthdays here and give a dessert as other places do, because nothing came after dinner.

Average sea food restaurant!!!After reading a few of the rave reviews I was hoping to be the next critic to sing their praises, but in my honest opinion, it was just an average dining experience. Fog Harbor is your typical sea food joint with all the usual cuisine reinforced by sublime views of the bay and Wharf below. Upon arrival I was seated fairly quickly (considering it was Mother's Day and very crowded) at the bar, of course, which I'm used to since I typically dine alone. My meal consisted of battered fried cod filets and three, maybe four decent, but certainly not jumbo sized shrimp---as I was expecting, a side of coleslaw and fries. The fish and shrimp tasted fine; nothing spectacular, coleslaw was bland. I prefer mine creamy and sweet. Maybe it's the Floridian in me, lol. On a positive note, the vignette wine soda is definitely worth a try, for non drinkers who want to put on a spin on things. It's like drinking Chardonnay without feeling the buzz. I will say that the staff was friendly and accommodating, although, the guy who was waiting on me did disappear for awhile, but they were super busy, so it's understandable. In summation, Fog harbor is a classic sea food joint, safe and reassuring, but nothing outstanding. The local Red Lobster, in my opinion would meet the same expectations for slightly lesser the price.

I went here this week with a small group of people. We didn't make a reservation but came around 6pm so we're able to be seated in around 20 minutes. The service was great and the starting sourdough bread was delicious. For my main I had a special, a scallop risotto. My friend had a mixed seafood travel that he was kind enough to give me a bite of which was amazing. I'd suggest sticking to straight seafood options here (obviously). The prices are a bit high but the value you get is pretty good and portions are large.

Just walking by and found this place. Our party of 7 was quickly seated in the back by the window. We had a really good view! We shared the calamari and everyone got the clam chowder. I got the soup/ caesar salad combo with added chicken to my salad. Surprisingly, the food came out really quickly, I didn't even get a chance to butter my bread and eat it! The calamari was really good and the tartar sauce was creamy and delicious. The caesar could of used more dressing but it was still good. The clamchowder came in a bread bowl and was really delicious. The sign said it was a SF top 10 restaurant and popular specifically for their clamchowder. I would have preferred it to be a little chunkier but overall really good.Good place with great views! Will definitely stop by next time I'm back in SF.

I don't care it's a touristy spot. It's a decent restaurant with an awesome view. Plus it's my dad approved. Came here with my dad when we visited SF a few years ago. I was living in Texas back then and wanted to take my dad for a good seafood meal when we were doing our tourist thing at Pier 39. After looking at nearby restaurants, we decided to eat here for lunch. I went all out and ordered a bunch of dishes including oysters, crab cake, whole Dungeness crab, clam chowder, etc. for a couple of hundred dollars. Food was very fresh and tasty. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. And the view was amazing. My dad was super happy with the food and whole experience. I was so glad he liked it. This place deff brings back memories. Fast forward a few years, I now live in the Bay Area. I'll take my whole family back here when they visit me in the city!

Fancy restaurant on the Fisherman's Wharf. It's located on the second floor and they have their own restroom! I came to Fog Harbor for their claim to have the best clam chowder. Yes, it was good but I don't think it lived up to the hype. A local told us a placed called Chowders will have the best clam chowder.We also got half dozen of oysters and that was delicious! It was also $17 for half dozen... which In my opinion is expensive. The views were lovely. Would I come back to this place? I'm not sure but it was definitely worth a try and to check it off my list. It is mostly a tourist attraction.

This was not my first time at fog Harbor but this was the best experience I've ever had! Our server Sarah was the best!! As soon as we sat down Sarah greeted us with a smile and throughout our whole meal she was very attentive. It's hard to find great food and service now and days and fog harbor exceeded our expectations! We started off with two glasses of Chardonnay and continued our meal by having the award-winning clam chowder and finished with the shellfish platter. Thank you Sarah and fog harbor for the great experience

It's a pretty decent restaurant in the pier, nice ocean views and pretty good food. We decided to settle with this restaurant since we all just kind of wanted to sit and just enjoy the view after a kind day of driving and walking around SF. We were seated right next to the window which was perfect because there was a nice view of the bay and all the city lights which made it a perfect dining experience. We each ordered something different, as we had chowder bread bowls, halibut and mash, seafood pastas, steaks, and lots of other stuff. The food is a bit pricey but I mean it's the location that makes it that but it's still pretty decent. The service was really good as our server was pretty attentive and he made little comments and jokes here and there which made our night so much more fun. Overall this restaurant is pretty good whether your a tourist or a local.

Fog Harbor is definitely in a tourist hot spot, but that didn't stop me from kicking back and enjoying the view and going all in on a seafood feast.We waited about an hour to get in, and while we were starving we were rewarded for our patience. Clam chowder, swordfish, crab cocktail -- all things that are infinitely better in San Francisco than my hometown and I enjoyed everything here thoroughly, despite the hefty price tag. Our service was fine, and I get that if you're a SF native you're probably not spending a lot of time around Pier 39 but this spot came through in the clutch and I'd recommend it.

Located on Pier 39, this is a good spot to grab lunch before doing some sightseeing. The food, views, and service were great here! We were famished when we got here. Wanting to eat before we went to the Aquarium, we were seated within 15 minutes. Right after we were seated, we were brought out bread and some drinks. My son and I were in the mood for comfort food. While my son ordered the fish and chips, I ordered the fried shrimp and fries. My husband ordered the swordfish. We also ordered the calamari appetizer. The calamari came out fairly quickly and was delicious. My son and I both thought our meals were wonderfully tasty. I thought the coleslaw and fries were yummy too. My husband, who went the healthier route, said his swordfish was fresh and delicious as well. Service was good here. Our drinks were refilled quickly. Our server checked on us often. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. Even though though the restaurant was extremely busy, everyone was really nice here.For a nice relaxing lunch on the pier with amazing views of the water, this is a great spot for a meal when visiting Fisherman's Wharf!

Decided to go out on Saturday night down to Pier 39 to feast on some good seafood and this placed was the destination. I thought initially it would be a good idea to make a reservation because I thought it would be busy but when I called the lady on the line indicated that the only times available would be around 10:00 pm and that if I arrived early there would be plenty of seating. So, I arrived around 7:00 pm and waited in line briefly before being met by the hostess. When I finally asked about a table to hostess told me it would be about a 30 to 45 minutes wait for a table!!! At this point, I am so disappointed in having to wait because I was initially told that there would be tables available.I give my name and phone number to be notified when my table will be ready. I then proceed to take my seat and wait. The system that they have here is that the will text you or call you when your table is ready if you are not in the area. One nice thing is that the staff said that the wait may be shorter than the estimated time that they provided which I found to be a bit comforting. As I wait I take a few pictures admire backdrop of the bay and the sights at the Pier. After 45 minutes go by I proceed to the hostess and ask if my table is ready. She then asks for my name and then looks through the names. She then says that she does not see my name. Then she proceeds to ask me who took my name and number and tell her that she took it. Apparently, according to her, she called out the name earlier and someone took my spot. WHAT!!! My next question is did she check the ID? I get a blank stare and no answer, figures! What is the point of taking the name and phone number if you are not going to verify this information, come on man!!!! At this point, she apologizes and says it will be five minutes. At this point, I am just infuriated and disgusted by the madness of trying to get a table. Eventually, I am seated and ready to order. My server Adam was the best! He is the sole reason why this rating is so high. He was absolutely phenomenal. His recommendations were helpful and made my meal decision a whole lot easier. His timing to check-in was right on and the dessert tray was incredible. Unfortunately, I did not order dessert because my food was so good and I was stuffed. But, had I ordered a smaller meal I most definitely would have gotten a least one or everything from the dessert tray. Overall, the food was great but getting inside was just so much of a hassle and a pain. It is a good thing that servers like Adam work here because he really made the visit here worth it. I cannot say that about anyone else. #GoodFoodLongWait

I always enjoy Fog Harbor! They served hot crusty bread and butter. Not a lot of places serve got bread anymore or perhaps I'm not going to the right restaurants. LolTheir service was topnotch! There was tons of fast moving servers and lots of clientele ready to be served. The place was bustling with activity though we felt very taken care of.Their clam chowder is the bomb diggity! It is thick, rich, full of clams and potatoes. Not too creamy. Just how I like it.We ordered the fish and chips and this was my only area of concern. The fish was tasteless. No flavor at all! Very disappointing.Since we were running to catch the ferry we didn't have time to have the order remade.I'll still go back again and enjoy that crusty bread and clam chowder. Yum!

Fog Harbor Fish House is the perfect spot to grab lunch or dinner in the heart of all of Pier 39.The place is popular so expect wait times but don't let that stop you from having some of the best clam chowder in the bay area!Our large group didn't have to wait too long for a table, which was great (because we were hungry) Our table had a view of the water - as most of them do- which was fun!We started with the cheese bread and calamari but if you're not feeling apps the complimentary bread will be excellent too! The cheese bread was very creamy on top, crisp on the bottom. The calamari had jalapenos fried with it, which was incredibly refreshing and tasty! The clam chowder in a bread bowl was perfect for a late lunch! I wish I would have had room for the whole bread bowl!I highly recommend coming to Fog Harbor Fish house for a good meal and a good drink. It's a perfect place for a date or for a larger group.

Definitely one of the finest and best restaurants I've been to.Had the pleasure to come here for lunch-early dinner a couple of summers ago and I've been dying to come back to this city and this restaurant since then.We shared appetizers first, sliders, crab cake and crispy calamari. They all were on point!!I ordered Seafood Penne accompanied with a cup of their award winning clam chowder. I have to repeat myself, i've been wishing i could come back. Everything was perfect, from the food to the service. I said it was one of the finest restaurants i've been to because the way they take care of the customers' need is something else. Waiters and waitresses are on another level. At some point my phone died, since I was on vacation I was carrying my charger everywhere, I asked one of the waitresses to take my phone somewhere safe so it could charge a little and she brought me a portable charger so I wouldn't have to worry about it, she made my day. Of course, that's one of the things this restaurant has to offer to the clients but to me it was a kindness act and great way to take care of the clients' needs.If you happen to be in San Francisco, don't leave without paying a visit to this place. Almost forgot to mention, if you happen to be lucky like we were, you'll be seated near the huge windows that offer a view to the bay, in the evening it's BEAUTIFUL here. Come by and rate

It's a shame that our meal went downhill. We started with a delicious truffle scallop risotto, which was great. Then came the calamari, which was great with the additions of fried jalepenos and onions. But the garlic roasted dungeoness crab was EXTREMELY disappointing. Small in size, too oily, overcooked and preparation took away all crab flavor. Risotto though, delicious.

Ok this review will be short and sweet. I was cold and needed something to warm me up. I started reading reviews. So based on good reviews I decided to grab a cup of clam chowder. Besides this place states they have some of the best clam chowder.I must say I agree. The chowder was yummy to my tummy. It was rich and creamy. The flavor was perfect and I ate every last drop. I left happy and content. I would definitely go back and try some of there other food. One of the best clam chowders I've ever had.

The views you get of the bay overlooking Alcatraz are amazing while dining here. With all the options of clam chowder all over pier 39, this one is a few more dollars and slightly smaller but still tasted pretty good. It's a nice place to dine away from all the tourist and birds flying all over the place. The crab roll we ordered was tasty on top of a perfectly toasted bread. We noticed all the other food options available that was being eaten and they all looked good. You definitely can't go wrong with eating seafood here. The wait was about 30 minutes around noon time on a Friday which wasn't too bad at all. Definitely want to try the other items on the menu but the clam chowder is definitely a must while in San Francisco.

Checked out this place only because of its great Yelp reviews. Let's just say I was not disappointed. I had the Shellfish Tower ($68) which is pricey but good. I actually didn't want the lobster but it was the only way to get everything else in this chilled double platter. The iceberg wedge salad was excellent ($10). My picky-eater son like the Kids Fish & Chips too. Our waiter ("Bong") was very attentive and friendly. He was not pushy and often came to refill our water glasses. Great atmosphere as well.

FISH N CHIPS WITH A VIEW~CUSTOMER SERVICE: 5/5. AJ was our main server but the manager I believe and other servers were helping us out as well. Drinks were never empty and we always got more bread when we asked. Orders were taken at a timely manner and it only took about 15 minutes for all of our food to come out.FOOD:SOUP/SALAD COMBO: 5/5. Got the clam chowder bread bowl and Caesar salad. So good! I loved the salad dressing and the lettuce was very fresh and crispy. They leave the lettuce strips uncut so just a heads up. I honestly didn't think too much of it but it could be a little difficult to eat.FISH N CHIPS: 5/5. So crispy and big. The fish was delicious and the fries were great as well. Coleslaw could've been a bigger portion but not complaining. Came with about 3 big pieces! Definitely would get again.SEAFOOD PENNE: 5/5. Really creamy and lots of seafood. Portion for this was big and definitely filling. Pasta was cooked well. Nothing wrong with this dish. Highly recommend.OVERALL: 5/5. With views of the Pier from pretty much wherever you're sitting, great food and how classy the restaurant was, it could easily be a restaurant for a date night or a casual dinner. Can't wait to come back when in SF~

Went here on two separate occasions and was very pleased both times. Fog Harbor has a great seafood selection and wine options. The service was great. They really get you at the end when you ask for the desert menu -- they walk up with a huuuuge desert tray with all of the options on there. Not buying the entire tray's worth of desert is quite honestly the hardest thing I've ever had to do.Other reviewers are not wrong when they say the waterside view amazing. I purposely went there the second time around for a dinner date and the view was a great wow factor! Great date spot if you're visiting SF!

I originally chose this place because of the beautiful view. And that did not disappoint at all. But, if you have the option, come during daytime! The harbor is a bit dark at night.Our server was very sweet and helpful with suggestions.My friend and I decided to share a few dishes. We started with the calamari. Tasty and not overly fried, though I can't say I would order it again. For our entree we had the cioppino. Our server kindly had the plate split without us even asking.I'd been wanting to have cioppino in San Francisco for the longest time, because I found out that is where it's originated from (I found this out while looking for it everywhere in Italy LOL). They were anything but stingy with the portion of seafood - though I wouldn't have minded a little more crab hehe. And as this is a fish house on the harbor, the seafood was all super fresh! But unfortunately, I've had better cioppino elsewhere. Maybe it was something off about the broth, but I remember not feeling completely satisfied. Maybe my expectations were just too high.But my slightest bit of disappointment with my less than perfect cioppino was ceased when the dessert menu was brought out! They all looked so good that my friend and I had trouble deciding... but luckily there was a dessert with two mini portions! This worked out perfectly as my friend wanted the creme brulee and I wanted the dark chocolate mousse.The creme brulee was delicious! Sweet and perfectly glazed on top.The chocolate mousse... sent me to heaven. Perfect blend of bitter and sweet. Literally just melted in my mouth.Perfect way to start our SF trip!

Service was great, interior and view was excellent, food was delicious. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the clam chowder bowl.They have us a bowl of bread which we wish we saved for the appetizer we ordered. We got the chilli shrimp, it was so delicious !! They topped it off with two garlic bread, but we devoured that so quickly because the sauce was perfection. We would have used the bread they gave us in the beginning to dip it in the sauce. (I'm sure they would he gave us more if we asked)Then I ordered the shellfish platter for one, cooked cajun style because I special requested it that way. I wouldn't have it any other way, it was finger licking good.The clam chowder bowl with crabs was slightly bland for my tasting. I didn't care too much about it. I highly recommend the chili shrimp and shellfish platter! Enjoy!

This resulted in some miscommunication, however, Fog Harbor realized this and completely made up for it!! Our experience was beyond fabulous. Almost heavenly. The food was absolutely amazing and they even helped us reveal the sex of our baby. Tables around us even celebrated with us!

I had the crab ravioli special. It was really, really good. I was upset though, because I bit into hard chunks of shell three different times. It was a huge turn off, especially if I'm paying almost $30 for it and no shells are supposed to be in the meal. The fish and chips were awesome. The flavor of the batter was very good.

Well, this is the Second Best Clam Chowder for me in SF. The place is very nice and more fancy than all the peer in Pier 39. The food is great and seating are comfortable with the nice view. Since this store is really in middle of tourist spot, the store is busy most of the time. But the waiting time is not bad considered they are busy. The clam chowder are in bread bowl and taste is good just not the best for me. The non-alcohol drinks are interesting and taste good. The main dish and is the Bomb for me is the seafood platter. Everything in seafood platter are great, the clams, the Mussels, the Shrimp, the crab legs and the Flavored that come with it. You can also add lobster if you'd like and I think it's great to have this option. Overall this is a great place if you were to stop by Pier 39!

Was this place good, yes... but it didn't blow me away by any means. Some views are great depending on what table you get but ours was just "ok" which made me sad since we waited for over an hour. I had a "lipstick lemonade" that was sweet but hardly any alcohol. Shared a bread bowel that they said "best in San Francisco" but it was average. For dinner had the shrimpBrochette. The shrimp were a large size and tasty but the sides were undercooked. If you read my post I base them off there dollar value. Higher $ restaurants I expect better food, something to make me say wow. This wasn't it, good but nothing to make me want to come back.

We came here in a group of 4 on Sunday night and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.Food: The bread was soft and went well with my appetizer. I ordered the clam chowder topped with crab (off the appetizer menu) and it was absolutely fantastic. They put a hearty amount of crab on the delicious clam chowder.For the main course, I ordered the Dungeness crab ravioli. Not being a huge ravioli guy (but wanting some sort of non-bread carb with my meal) I didn't expect to be as blown away as I was. The ravioli was cooked thoroughly and the ricotta inside was smooth. The pasta itself paired well with the spinach and the Dungeness crab. Every bite was seriously perfection.Atmosphere: The restaurant is fancy and more upscale. The waiters are all professionally uniformed. Lots of tables looked like dates or nice dinner nights out. Parking: Given that this place is literally on the pier, parking will be a hassle to drive to this place. I would recommend Uber or walking here during your tourist explorations in SF. Service: The service really matched the mood. Our waiter was well-mannered and polite. He even brought us a second batch of bread.This place is not cheap by any means. Don't let the two dollar signs fool you. I would say this place should have $$$ next to it. However, if you're looking for a fancy night out, or some quality seafood (expensive but worth), or somewhere to impress a date, this is your place.
