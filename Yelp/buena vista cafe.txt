IRISH COFFEE. This is the best Irish Coffee I've had. The bartenders are whipping them up on turbo . You'll watch them make batches of 10+ at a time, and quickly. The dont skimp on the whiskey either. half coffee, half whiskey, and bomb heavy whipping cream or whatever it is. The place is in a tourist zone, but dont be scared. Just throw an order in at the bar, but be quick the bartenders are on a mission to make those Irish Coffees, and arent going to sit around waiting for you to make up your mind. What better way to start your day than with the best Irish Coffee in the land.

The Buena Vista is easily one of San Francisco's well known institutions and no matter how many times I visit, I'm happy to be back. Is it touristy? Very. Do I care? Not at all. As you've probably read from other reviews, this place is famous for it's Irish coffee. So famous in fact that the whiskey producer, Tullamore Dew has a special label for the bottles at The Buena Vista. I'm a fan of this producer and it goes really well in the drink. The other components are coffee, two sugar cubes and cream. They will accommodate substitutions, etc. Pro tip. Try and sit at the bar and have the nice gentleman with the mustache serve you as he's quite the magician. Enjoy!

We had seared tuna salad which was ok. The tuna was fresh. Dungeness crab was fresh. Crab cake Benedict was packed of crab. The porch eggs were perfectly cooked. The sauce was not impressive.The Irish cream was good. Not too strong and not too sweet.

If I invented a drink, I'd want it to be where people punch each other. Like when my kids saw a VW Beetle and screamed: Punch Buggy! If you're known to invent the first Irish coffee in America? Dang... someone better be cutting me a royalty check each month. Now just like there is pizza from NYC, you can't duplicate that creation elsewhere in the US. Ever have pizza in Memphis TN? Ewww gross! They can sure rock some BBQ! So you can bet no one is duplicating this drink I traveled across the country to try.My wife & I walked from our hotel to Fishermans Wharf. I felt like damn Lewis & Clark with all this walking. She's window shopping, looking in stores, all I'm thinking about is this drink. We sit down for dinner around the corner from Buena Vista ;) After dinner, I make a bee line to Buena Vista.The bar isn't that large. We see two open seats and the bartender walks over to us. I order Irish Coffees. I watch him make it, it looks so simple every state across the US should be making this drink. The bartender brings the end result to me.I take a sip.The cold cream first hits you but you have to tilt the glass to get to the Irish Whiskey and coffee.The bartender told my wife, he could also make the same drink with Baileys. My wife smiles, we'll be returning today. If your on vacation in San Francisco, you must try this drink.

There is only one reason to go to the Buena Vista. And its the reason every goes, and you should too. Their claim to fame is as the originator of the Irish Coffee. And they make the most of it! Two will set you back $21 plus tip.Do it. trust me. Besides, if you go to SF and don't go here, people will look at you funny.

I'd been to Buena Vista several years ago and decided to take my son there for breakfast. Street parking on a weekday was surprisingly easy and we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. You seat yourself, and I like that they encourage separate parties to share tables. The table next to us included a few couples, two were tourists and the other was local. It made for a lively (by the sound of it) and interesting meal!I had the the BV Breakfast (French toast, eggs, bacon & hash browns), my son had the corned beef hash and eggs with toast. The food was very good, but the best thing was the toast! It's two pieces of sourdough, toasted on the flat top and it comes out warm and crispy.We'll definitely go back, and I'll be having the toast!

Pro Tip: Wander in and begin standing next to a table that looks like it is going to leave, this is the only way you will get seating. There are additional tables towards the restroom that have AC and are quiet and less hustle and bustle. Food: I don't think there is anything that isn't good from what the locals say. I'm a fan of the sandwiches for something light for lunch. There is a lot of meat on them though so I definitely could've shared with my husband. Ordered a Rueben and French Dip Service: It is busy in here!!! However, if you are friendly with them, they will be friendly back and provide great service. We had the pleasure of having Suzanne wait on us. She has been working here 20 years. She is funny, sassy, and made great recommendations.Overall, loved the experience and would definitely come back!

Came here for the Irish coffee, it was really strong I felt a buzz almost immediately, I expected it to be sweeter, ask for an extra sugar if you have a sweet tooth. The older gentlemen bartending are funny and chatty, they wear these dapper white waist coats, the bars I usually go to have shirtless bartenders that flirt with you for tips so this was a nice change and a fun experience.Walking distance from Ghirardelli Square.

Re-Birth Place of Irish Coffee! Make no mistake, the original version of Irish Coffee was created in Foynes, Ireland; however, a Chicago born travel writer for the San Francisco Chronicle named Stanton Delaplane drank it in Shannon Airport and convinced then owner of Buena Vista Cafe, Jack Koeppler, that he should sell it. The legend goes that the two worked "hard" through the night to recreate the delicious drink and even at some point involved the mayor of San Francisco for his dairy expertise and that is how Irish Coffee was re-born in San Francisco!I have been here many times and even managed to get a very mild buzz on multiple glasses of Irish (and other) coffees. The drinks are great, naturally, but I love the fact that you'll have to share a table with other fellow patrons! I have met very interesting people from all over the place over the years. I think one of the side effects of Irish Coffee is that it makes casual conversations much easier!!The food is good too. I've had breakfast here, but honestly, Irish Coffee is the main reason I stop by when I do!

My friends and I all ordered an Irish coffee (~$11-12 with tip & tax). I wouldn't say it's the best drink I ever had, but I can't say it's the worst (I honestly didn't really know what to expect though). It was cool being in such a historical building and having what the cafe was known for. If my friends and I hadn't ordered food at Crabsters before (which I wouldn't really recommend going to - nothing special), I would've considered eating here.

Wavering between 3 and 4 stars on this one. You cannot get better Irish coffees than what is served here. I also really like the Bailey's Irish Cream though it's much lighter and not as strong. 5 stars for quality of the drinks here. A Bailey's is about $10. The Irish coffee is like fire running down your throat with the cool cream to top it off.The servers are not always the quickest though it's not for lack of hard work; they're just generally super busy all the time and running around to serve tables as quickly as possible in a friendly manner.It's pretty much first-come first-serve seating and you'll often end up sitting at table with random people you don't know out of desperation. It's never been an issue. I do like that they haven't really changed the ambience because it really does feel historical though it gets a lot of tourists. This is the original place for an Irish coffee so if you want to try that, don't go anywhere else.

We visited during the heatwave and man was it hot! We visited as part of a larger group. We were able to get a table pretty fast and get some waters. It was very loud and when we ordered our beers we got the wrong ones. Knowing how loud and busy it was we decided to just drink what we were given. The food was decent, the wings came cooked but with no sauce on them, only a small bowl of sauce was given for 8 wings. The steak I ordered was a bit over cooked for my taste but after a long day of traveling and battling the heat we just wanted to eat and go to bed. The place was very cute and I think that on any other day it would have been fine but the heat just made things ten times worse. I would like to come back and try again.

Only stopped by for the Irish Coffee. We walked in and the place was already packed. Luckily, a couple walked out as we walked in and we were able to swoop up on those seats at the bar! It's unbelievable how many and quickly the bartenders make these Irish Coffees. I can definitely see why they are in such demand in the city! The drink has a subtle bitter coffee taste with a kick of whiskey and the sugary cream on top definitely evens it all out. I want to say its a bit pricey but I can definitely understand the $10.50 price tag. My boyfriend who is normally not a coffee/sweets type of person ended up getting 3 of them! The service is quick as mentioned above. The bartender serving us was pretty cool. Don't expect super friendly service. It seems like they've been there for years and are very seasoned at what they do. However, it is the type of service I would want at a bar/restaurant like Buena Vista Cafe. The couple next to us asked our bartender how many Irish Coffees he makes a day and the bartender made a dig and responded "I just lost count because you asked that question!" We all laughed and you can tell the bartender had no intent of malice. Next time i'm in the city, I will be trying out the breakfast with a few Irish Coffees to throw back! Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting or even the locals!

I'll take e 4 Irish coffees and a appetizer of nachos please. First timer here. It was extremely packed! I was a bit lost with direction and how to order, but I guess just treated it as if I am at a normal bar. Great service, Irish coffees are great, and comes with a kick of whisky, so beware before ordering one. Love this place! Definitely making this a must come when I am back here in SF.

Irish coffee at 10am....my type of place! A coworker recommended this place to me and that Irish coffee was born here. He wasn't wrong and it seems that Irish coffee is just flowing in everyone's veins. It's a lot sweeter than how I normally take my coffee, but then again you've got a shot of whiskey in it....so it was PERFECT. Simple french toast breakfast with bacon and eggs and you're good to go. I thought about sharing with the boyfriend and tried to egg him on to get something else. I'm glad I didn't....I didn't want to share mine lol. Sometimes simple food and some whiskey is all you need for a homerun. It does get packed, but I think it's worth it. For our party of 2 to sit down right away, they had us sit with another party of 2 who was sitting at a table for four. It was awkward at first because strangers. But they were tourists too visiting from South America, so it wasn't bad at all chatting with them about the city and our hometowns. It would have been nice to have the extra elbow room though. TIP: Order an Irish coffee to go ;)

There's a reason this place has been copied so many times, especially at the airport. There's a great SF vibe in here and the Irish coffee is legit on virtually every day in SF: cool, cloudy, and rolling fog. Be friendly with tourists, especially if you are unable to get a seat. Bonus: Watching them pour rows of coffees from about 3 feet above the cups is impressive.

I just fell in love with this Irish pub. It's classic looking and has the feel of a traditional pub from back in the day. Even the bartenders are dressed to par with how they used to look; clean white shirt, black tie, white pants, and a clean white coat. I came for one thing and one thing only and that's their famous Irish Coffee. This is where it all started. The Irish coffee originated around the early 50's here by a man named Stanton. He was a writer for the SF chronicle during the time and brought over the creation of Irish coffee to the U.S. Ever since then, Buena Vista became the headquarters and the proud founder of it all. It's priced at $10.50 and is served in this classic glass cup. It consists of 1 sugar cube, specially brewed coffee, stir it up, Buena Vista Irish Whiskey, and foamed milk to top it all off! It's basically crack and is truly addicting. I had two this morning! AMAAAAAZING!

The Irish coffees are strong, the crab cakes are hot, and the people are kind! My friend and I got the Crab Cake Benedict and the BV Breakfast to go with our two Irish coffees. The Crab Cake Benedict was delicious! The egg was perfectly poached, and the crab cakes had that lovely crisp on the outside. The BV Breakfast was pretty standard for breakfast fare, but what I love about it is that you get a little bit of sweet with your 'classic' savory breakfast. It comes with two eggs (however you like it), two pieces of bacon, a side of potato hash, and two pieces of French toast. Just enough for those who can't make up their minds or are craving something a bit more traditional.It is very crowded, and you can't buy food at the bar. However, you're encouraged to join other people's tables because of how small the venue is, and people expect it. I met a lovely couple who gave me some recommendations of what to get and which breweries to visit in Alameda (look forward to those reviews when I get to it). So get yourself to Buena Vista, meet some nice people, share some breakfast/brunch/lunch! You can even buy a commemorative hoodie with the bartender on it! Enjoy!

My wife and I stopped in for an Irish coffee during a recent trip to San Francisco. We found out about this place from a Drinking Made Easy episode. The Irish coffee here is by far the best I've ever had. We have been to Ireland and the coffees at Buena Vista blow their Irish counterparts out of the water. I especially like the cold cream on top of the drink. It was a nice contrast and the perfect topping to an excellent drink!

I really like this place. It's the kind of spot you'd want to bring your parents when they are visiting San Francisco. It's touristy but it's worthy of a visit as it is genuine. It's famous for the Irish coffees but it seems to be more famous for the holiday type atmosphere. Always busy and hustling. I tried the food here too and t was good though I think I made the wrong choice. I had the turkey club with potato salad, and it was average. The food on other tables looked a lot better though. Their Fries are decent, with Parmesan. I liked the look of their fish and chips also. The Irish coffees themselves are very good, even though they are a little too sweet. The tullamore dew is very smooth. And the beer on tap is surprisingly good and crisp as an alternative.

Home of the City's original Irish Coffee since 1950, the Buena VIsta Cafe is constantly bumbling and stumbling with an average of 2,000 coffees being served daily. Some are certain to have fallen and stumbled in and out the door. Seating is shared at round tables and most will be in a good mood. With very few rules and etiquette to be shared here, the featured menu item here is the Irish Coffee. Although they are smooth and small, beware of the aftermath. That could include a coffee/alcohol headache, or the bill at $10 a pop. I walked in sluggishly after a big lunch and walking the Embarcadero. I walked out after a few of these coffees with a full burst of energy and ready to take on the second half of the day! I was able to speak to people I didn't know because of the shared seating and it was fun! It does seem like they are trying to just push out service as fast as they can because so many people are coming and going! Still worth the experience if you've never been!

We went here after riding a cable car -- the last stop is in front of this restaurant. I was really excited for this place, the menu looked awesome.We came in and it wasn't clear that it was seat yourself, so we stood around confused for 5 minutes. The bartender finally told us to pick a seat, so we chose to sit up at the bar. "Oh, we don't serve food up here," the bartender said.Finally, we found a seat and then waited an additional 20 minutes for a server to even look at us. When she finally came over, she rolled her eyes and impatiently waited for our order. I worked as a server for almost 7 years and even I was appalled at her behavior the entire meal. We got Irish Coffees. They were ok. Nothing to write home about.The food was decent. My boyfriend and I both got the crab omelette. The omelette itself wasn't memorable (maybe I'm spoiled by Philly brunch), but the sourdough was out of this world. But from what I hear, sourdough all over San Francisco is phenomenal.Overall, I wouldn't say the high prices and crappy service isn't worth it. I think they capitalize off location and don't care if tourists have a good time or not.

Served in a pretty glass with a thick layer of hand-whipped cream floating on top like a kiss from an angel, and a delicious whiskey and coffee mixture lurking beneath, it was truly a treat coming in from the brisk Bay Area weather. Definitely recommend!Bonus: sit at the counter to watch the bartenders make your drink, including hand whipping the cream!

This place has not changed and the drinks are as good as ever.We stopped in for dinner on a Sunday; that was a good choice and we were able to get a table very quickly. Rebecca ordered the New York strip steak and I ordered crab cakes. A glass of Pinot Noir for Rebecca and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc for me rounded out the meal. The food and wine went well together.Of course, the meal ended with Irish coffee and bread pudding. It was a great way to finish the meal. Both were wonderful. I am looking forward to my next visit.

Tourist trap for sure, but I must say - the Irish coffee ($10.50) was really good. Even my friend, who doesn't drink whiskey, said it was good. We came in on a Saturday afternoon at around 3 and the place was packed. There was barely any room to walk. That being said, do not come here expecting to sit down for a rest and a quiet environment. Do expect noisy crowds, a few elbows in your back, and some good Irish coffee. My best advice is to pop in, get your coffee, drink it quickly, and take a break elsewhere.

This was a recommendation from my friend's dad. He said we had to come in here for the Irish Coffee. Since he knows our style, we trusted it and came to Buena Vista Cafe.I was glad to find seats right at the bar. Cute little place and fairly busy!We explain we were here for the famous Irish Coffee & our bartender got to work. he gave us some history & was really friendly. While making the drinks he saw us take a selfie. Instead of the typical mocking, he mocked our selfie but then offered to take multiple pictures for us! He even took some behind the bar of the drink making process. I loved how well dressed the bartenders were, shows attention to detail & brings you back to the 1950's.I wasn't much for the Irish coffee but that's a personal taste and I really came for the experience, which this place really delivered on!

Best Irish coffees in the city!! Breakfast is just okay. You go for the coffees!! I always bring out-of-towners here. It's the best! Always packed though. Little tip-- there's a hidden little back room by the bathrooms people tend to miss.

Irish coffee, that's all I have to say! Get it to-go and walk along the water. Super busy on the weekend but it's to be expected given it's location.

Great place for an early morning breakfast, before the crowds show up. Service is great, food was delicious, and the Irish Coffee is a must have (if you are of age). Don't sit at the bar section close to the door if you're planning on eating - drinks only.

What is the deal with all these five star reviews? You are in one of the best culinary cities in the country and the food is nothing. I am cursed with a teenage boy who will eat nothing but wings and French fries so I try to find a good pub where I can eat food. This is not it. The service was fine but the food was chilis good.

Irish coffee lovers this is a must see spot. They serve 2,000-3,000 a day during their busy days according to the barback we spoke to! Super friendly staff. The bartenders are brothers, and have been there for years. There's something super charming about having a little history to the story. One of the brothers is known for his card tricks, be sure to ask if it is him! If Irish coffees aren't your thing, the baileys and coffee is a great second choice!! If nothing else, sit at the bar and just watch them in action. It's impressive! The best part? They offer these delicious cocktails to go! Be forewarned though they don't serve food at the bar, drinks only! And the tables are all community seating so if you see some open seats, seat yourself anywhere! Such a cool little spot in town. Looking forward to our next visit back!

Started at pier 39 and walked all the way down. Just after The Cannery, I thought two things: my feet are killing me, and have I left all the restaurants behind? I wanted someplace comfortable, friendly, relaxed. I wanted large portions of food, having hardly anything to eat today. I didn't know it at the time, but I also wanted Irish coffee's non alcoholic brother, Irish tea. I found all of that at the Buena Vista cafe. It looks like a bar alone, but they do food really well. Dear god, the cheese omelet! I added bacon, and it was real bacon, and a LOT of it in that omelet. You could taste the cheese, too. The OJ was fresh squeezed and delicious.My waitress was awesome. Friendly, funny, yet gave me space to stare out at the ocean and relax. I love this place. I will return.

Group of 3 came here for brunch late Sunday morning. We were surprised to find out that the seating is communal. Since this is a popular time, there were no open spots so we decided to sit at the bar and get some Irish coffee (and no, you can't order food at the bar, unfortunately). Running at about $10ish, it's made very well, as it should be since it is the headliner here. After about 20 minutes, 3 spots opened up at a table so we were able to move over there and order our food (along with more Irish coffees!). I got the Mexican Omelette which comes with some delicious sourdough bread and home fries. The flavors were on point and the server was attentive despite the place being busy. Other than the weird seating, this place is great so I'll definitely be back here!

We came, we drank, we ate, and we drank summore. Perfect spot for breakfast in advance of our day-long tour that began at 10am. The hype is real about the Irish Coffee. So real that every night we made a 20 minute detour to Buena Vista Cafe just to get a coffee before heading out to dinner or drinks for the evening. Unlike any Irish coffee you've ever had, promise.

Best breakfast I have ever had. Obviously we loved the Irish coffee but went back for the breakfast. Our hotel recommended it very highly for the food and boy were they right. I had the country eggs Benedict, my Mother had he French toast and my Wife had the two egg breakfast as did my kids. We all loved it. Also very important to mention that their regular coffee was perfect. I hate it when I have breakfast and the food is good but the coffee tastes like shit. Luckily Buena Vista makes great food and coffee.

It's an institution in San Francisco but I think there needs to be some some attention to food quality in order to have this institution thrive. The famed Irish coffee was cold, hardly any whiskey, and the whipped cream grainy. I ordered an omelette that was also cold. The potato hash was tasteless and also cold. Servers brought my sour dough toast long after my meal. The toast was the best part. I don't think I will be back.

Cold hearted hipsters give Buena Vista below 5 stars. And communists. The original Buena Vista is an institution and don't forget it. Love the man who makes hundreds of Irish coffees daily. Praise him. Don't blame a place for it's own success, for this cafe is a historic monument to San Francisco.Thank you Stanton Delaplane for being stubborn enough in 1952 to perfect the this prestigious coffee/cream/alcohol concoction.

My sister and I came here because it is rated one of the best bars in SF. We got here pretty early and didn't have to wait! I like that you sit with strangers at large circular tables. Many people we talked to traveled from all over California. Their toast is literally to die for. I'm not much of a drinker, especially in the morning, so my sister drank my Irish coffee, but I could definitely see why this place is famous for them! It's also fun to watch the older dapper looking bartenders. It looks like they've worked there for years (in a good and interesting way). By the time we were done eating there was a large line waiting for open seating. As I'm a slow eater it was a little stressful for me to rush my breakfast so others could take my seat but overall great experience!!

Touristy and overpriced. The atmosphere is cozy, but man, our server was so unfriendly; she walked up to our table and just looked at us like, "well, what do you want?" and raised her eyebrows without saying anything. I didn't realize it was so difficult to actually ask customers if they are ready to order. I tried the famous Irish Coffee--overpriced and average. Like, seriously overpriced. I also ordered the burger, which wasn't bad, just super average. And again, overpriced. I suppose it comes with the territory: you're in the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area, so what do you expect? Well, I expect that I won't feel like my server is irritated that I exist, or that every dollar spent was a dollar wasted. I will not return.

This is my second trip here while visiting the west coast. My husband and I come solely for the Irish Coffees. They are pricy, 11 dollars to be exact. But what do you expect for the so called birth place of Irish Coffees? I wasn't mad and neither was my husband. Even when it's crowded, you can find a seat at the bar within 5-15 minutes. The presentation is cool and we got some good pictures to take home to show our friends on the East Coast!

An SF classic. We always come here when we have family/friends visiting us to get an Irish coffee after a long day of being tourists in the city. It's definitely always crowded, but you can usually find a seat if you keep your eyes open. Despite how crazy busy it is and the open seating- the service is always prompt and friendly. You will probably end up sharing a table with strangers, but it's a great way to meet new people and have a chat. The last time we were here, the lady across from us recommended the Gin Fizz. She offered to let us try hers and we loved it so much that we ended up ordering our own. You will definitely see the majority of people drinking Irish coffees, but I would recommend definitely trying the Gin Fizz!

I've been coming here practically since I was born, and it will always have a special place in my heart. Came here recently for an excellent brunch. Ambience: 5/5It's a cool old bar, and perfect for the area it's in. You get to sit with people you don't know when it's crowded (which is all the time), but that makes for some fun conversations. Food: 5/5I had Eggs Benedict, and it was amazing! The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce was well balanced with the eggs. A friend had the Denver omelette, which he said was wonderful as well. Service: 4/5Pretty good, considering they were super busy. They were very nice, and food came out relatively quickly for how packed they were. Overall, I'm biased because I love this place and any review I do is going to be influenced by the attachment I have to this wonderful gem. It's pricey, but I think it's worth it for the atmosphere. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back here in the future!

We came in and we were waiting for the waitress to direct us on where to sit. She told us to seat ourselves but I didn't hear so I asked her to repeat herself. She rudely repeated herself without making eye contact, so we made our way to the bar which was the only available seat. At the bar, we were then told that we could only sit there if we were purchasing drinks, so we had to get up and find another seat. When we ordered, and I wanted to take out one ingredient, I was told that the omelette ingredients were pre-mixed and that would not be possible. We were served within 5 minutes of ordering. The omelette was not filling or delicious at all. It was a thin egg crepe with ingredients wrapped inside. My friend ordered corned beef hash which had a piece of hair in it. The fruit bowl that we ordered had soft and mushy grapes in there. We were initially charged for ordering bread which the server had offered us so we had thought were included in our meal. Thankfully my friend pointed all of this out so they removed her order and the two breads from our check.Make sure you check your food for hair and your check for errant charges before you pay. I will definitely not be coming back here again.

Stopped in for a late breakfast and ordered the crab cake Benedict. Not great, not terrible, just ok. This is one of the eggs benedict options that does NOT come with an English muffin underneath (booo!) and I didn't really care for the sauce on top (kind of tastes like tomato soup) and the potatoes it comes with were also just ok but could have used a little seasoning. Irish coffee was pretty good but a little too strong for me (I'm not much of a whiskey girl).
