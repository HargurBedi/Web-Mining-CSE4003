This place is perfect for date night or a very impressive date! If you didn't know, this restaurant is a fixed price 3 course dinner with two options per course and also an optional pasta course for ($10/person). If you bring your significant other like I did, you'd be able to try basically all the dishes on the menu!The food was solid and the selection changes frequently (not sure how often though). The presentation is on point for all the dishesThe service was also excellent, it was my girlfriend's birthday and they had a birthday card ready for her on the table and also stuck a candle on the desert for her at the end. Conveniently located in FiDi and the edge of Russian hill, the restaurant is a short walk to The Embarcadero so some romantic walking after dinner is also a must ;)

Had a great date night with my husband. Service was great/casual and the food was prepared well. I thought the portions were on the smaller side at first, but after adding in the pasta course it ended up being the perfect amount of food. Space is a bit cramped, so if you don't like being half an arms length to the next table this may not be a good place for you. But definitely a gem in the city for value and quality.

This is my new favorite date night spot. It is also good for out of town visitors (parents, college friends, etc). Basically anyone you are trying to impress without breaking the bank. A cozy spot in the edge of Chinatown and Fidi, it has industrial chic decor and sports some giant green bouquet throughout. Their menu changes every week, so I won't review the dishes, rather I will review the ability of the chef. The preparation and presentation of food is perfect. The chef paid a lot of attention to select ingredients that compliment and balance each other, with some interesting ingredients and flavor profile. It is well executed classically crowd pleasing dishes with a twist. For example, the mushroom risotto has an exotic blend of mushrooms baked into chips and sprinkled on top with some herbs and spices. The result is a wonderfully creamy risotto with a delightful texture and refreshing flavor. Wow. For 2 tasting menu with a pasta add-on course, it came to be about $100 after taxes and tip. I wish they had a punch card rewards program, I will be here every week.

I love Trestle. Not only is the food amazing, but it's very reasonable as well. $35 rotating prix-fixe menu consisting of your choice of appetizer, entree, dessert and an optional $10 pasta supplement (you get two options of each). I shared the supplement with Sarah K. and it was the perfect amount of food for us in addition to our individual stuff. My favorites were the crispy-skin striped bass with pickled grapes and roasted cauliflower. The vanilla vacherin we had for dessert was amazing as well. Omg, dat olive oil cake. Reservations are a must because restaurant gets packed! Be prepared, you may sit really closely to your neighboring tables. Can't wait to come back to try a new menu!

What a treat to go to Trestle! I've had this place bookmarked for awhile, and all it took was a spontaneous date night with my boyfriend to finally make reservations here. Surprisingly there was availability on a Sunday night, as small as this place is. But you should REALLY make reservations instead of walking in. I think we just got lucky. Anyways, we arrived and were immediately seated in the back. Cute woodsy and candlelight ambiance. Perfect for a romantic but casual date night. The service was fantastic, as was the presentation of food. There's a $35 prix fixe menu of the evening, saving us from the most daunting and time-consuming part of dinner... deciding what to eat. Everything was delicious... the soup, meat, and dessert. Good variety of tastes and textures. I can't exactly recall WHAT we ate that night, despite the photos I took, but if you scroll through all the photos on Yelp, everything is absolutely gorgeous. Almost too good-looking to eat!I would highly recommend bookmarking Trestle if you haven't been here yet. Even if you have, the fact that their menu changes and their service remains stellar is a good reason to come back and experience more of what the amazing chefs serve up. Plus, if you come with a +1 you can easily try all the options on the prix fixe menu.

Finally made it here and it did not disappoint! Love the trendy but cozy vibe. We came on day 2 of SF Heat Wave 2017 (aka global warming is real) and they had these cute little personal fans for diners. The staff were all very professional and friendly. And because it's a prix fixe menu, the food all came out super fast. We took our time and were still in and out of there in an hour. I know the menu changes often, but here's what we had.- Popcorn Shrimp Salad: The shrimp were nice and crunchy. It was like a very refreshing caesar but so tasty and just perfect for the crappy heat west weather.- Crispy Skin Mt. Lassen Trout: The skin was super crispy. Trout was cooked perfectly. I loved the scallion salsa on the plate, just wonderful!- Coconut Custard and Chocolate Pot de Creme: Both were outstanding! The perfect amount of sweet with wonderful texture. Great way to wrap up this wonderful meal.We walked away happy and full as it was a truly excellent meal at a very reasonable price for SF. Can't wait to go back and try the pasta course when it's not a million degrees out!

Great price for quality food! The three-course prix fix menu was easy to follow and all options sounded delicious. We were able to add two supplemental pastas for our table of five to share, which was a nice plus. The service was great. They were on top of their work and kept the food coming at a perfect pace. The restaurant accommodated one of my friends that is a vegetarian even though the main options in their prix fix menu both included meat. They brought him a quinoa and lentil dish, which he said was very delicious, and removed other meat components from his dishes. We made a reservation and got seated right away. I would highly recommend making a reservation because the restaurant filled up really quickly! Trestle is pretty small and the tables are set pretty close to each other so it did get loud and cramped, but I don't think it was that big of a deal. I would definitely come back again!

How did it take me so long to hear about this place? A high-quality 3 course meal for $35 a person is unheard of in San Francisco, but Trestle makes this dream a reality.Reasons why Trestle is so awesome:1. As mentioned, it's 3 courses for $35, with your pick between two different options for every course. You can also add a pasta supplement to make it 4 courses for $40 if you'd like (highly recommend!). Such a deal in San Francisco for the amount of money you're paying.2. The options per course are quite different, so unless you're insanely picky, you can probably pick out something you'll love. Or even better, go with one other person, and you can try everything on the menu, which is a huge variety.3. Their prix fixe menu changes daily depending on seasonality and what's fresh. You could come here nearly everyday and not get bored. That takes some serious talent (and balls) to pull off, and that's something I really appreciate.4. Literally everything is delicious. Of course some dishes stand out more than others, but seriously, every bite is great.On the particular night that I went, some highlights included tomato soup with avocado and crispy paprika quinoa, lamb bucatini with olives, crispy skin trout with a hazelnut romesco sauce, and the most amazing chocolate pot de creme I've ever had.Can't wait to go back because I definitely will.

Seasonal menu, most come for the prix fix menu which seems like a good deal. Tried the beet and carrot salad for starter which was good with a yogurt dressing underneath. Added on the shrimp risotto and pork pasta outside of the prix fix menu, and both were so flavorful and rich with flavor. I love the risotto texture and would have to go with that as my fave of the two. For the main, tried the bass. The green wasabi dressing wasn't my fave it was a mix of different flavors that I was trying to figure out and didn't seem to pair well with the rest of the plate but A for effort. For dessert, tried the chocolate cake with bacon ice cream. An A for creativity but follow through a bit lacking. I've heard great things about this place and would come back to try a different menu, but this Night didn't hit it out of the park for me. On the upside, Also tried the a local white wine which paired well with the meal and recommended by our server.

The hubby's 25th birthday is most certainly a special occasion and after going though a multitude of options of where to take him, I decided to make reservations at Trestle for a Saturday evening.Luckily, the horrendous parking situation of SF didn't cast too dark of a shadow on our bright day, thanks to a parking garage literally right next to the restaurant that charged $2.00 for every 30 minutes on the weekend. When we walked inside the eatery, we were surprised to see a little card on the table, wishing my hubby a sweet birthday and signed by the staff. Already, that was a very nice touch.I will say that in terms of space, Trestle is a SUPER tight fit. Tables are UNCOMFORTABLY close together--so close, that you not only hear every word coming out of the mouth of the person sitting next to you, but tables had to also be pushed aside in order for patrons to get in and out. It's definitely not a place for an intimate date or for those who need elbow room.But the decor is nice and clean, and the servers were all very helpful. We really didn't have one person wait on us the entire night, but there was always someone there when we had a request. We especially liked how our silverware was promptly replaced after every course, making for an easy transition. Trestle is famous for its fixed three-course meal at $35 per person (an additional $10 if you want to have the extra pasta course). Because the hubby and I had a late lunch, we opted out of the pasta course and went with the usual pre-set menu, ordering both dishes from every category. For our visit, we had squash soup and fruit salad for appetizers, crispy sea bass and braised short rib for the main course, and a lemon pudding and chocolate angel chiffon cake for dessert.The ones that stood out the most for us were the squash soup, the short rib, and the crispy sea bass. The squash soup was delicately poured into the ceramic bowl at our table and dressed with Isaraeli couscous. I loved how the soup was decadent, but not the least bit heavy. The couscous added a fun element with its delightful crunch. The hubby greatly enjoyed the short rib, noting the tenderness of the meat and how it wasn't drowning in a sauce. He also liked the pickled cabbage and radish that added freshness to the dish. I, on the other hand, preferred the sea bass that had the most deliciously crispy skin. Just from cutting into it, I could hear the crackle of the skin breaking and it paired perfectly with the tomato base sauce that had asparagus and sausage. Amazing! While the other dishes weren't necessarily bad, they did fail in some aspects, such as the angel chiffon cake that was a bit dense and the fruit salad was dressed with too much feta cheese. We had also asked for a serving of the firehouse bread with salt and pepper butter, and while we enjoyed the butter, the bread was over-toasted. In terms of dessert, the hubby wasn't too fond of the lemon pudding, but I personally loved the tartness of the pudding and the sweetness of the pastry crumbs. It was almost like a deconstructed lemon pie.Even with all those hiccups, Trestle still managed to impress us. The quality of the ingredients and the beautifully presented dishes served as proof of how much thought and care Trestle puts into its food. Nothing can beat an amazing dinner to end a birthday celebration and from the way the hubby hugged me as we walked out of the restaurant, I'm proud to say Trestle made it a success. Definitely worth every penny!

Food: They only have a 3 course prix fixe menu with the option to add a pasta dish for an added cost. Went with my husband so we ordered each of the options available for the most part. Had the heirloom tomato salad (4/5), bacon minestrone soup (4/5), squik ink risotto (5/5), bucatini (3/5), trout (5/5), chocolate fudge (3/5) and hibiscus bar (3/5) - desserts were a bit too sweet. Drinks: only beer & wine. Had a couple of glasses of wine and dessert wine and enjoyed them allAmbiance: It's a small place and the tables are set up pretty close to each other. Service: no complaintsGlad we finally tried it but wouldn't necessarily come back again. Prefer to have more flexibility with the menu since we tend to not eat dessert when we go out.

A set menu for $35 in SF is such a rarity and steal. What have I come to, though? I remember in college I would not pay more than $10 for food... Trestle is actually quite delicious and I love the decor in here. It's a small space, so be sure to make reservations. Their summer menu was very refreshing (loved the corn soup!) and their salmon was delicious. However, it becomes luck what you get since you have to make reservations in advance and they rotate their menu weekly.

I've been to trestle 4 times and the menu has been different every time. The food is consistently creative and delicious, it is clear that a lot of thought and love has been poured into all their menu items. It is a 3 course meal for $35, and you can supplement a pasta dish for $10. The pasta dish is often my favorite course so I would highly recommend adding it! It's an easy menu to navigate- there are only two options to choose from for every course. I would always get one of each with whoever I am with. I have been pleasantly and unexpectedly surprised many times with certain dishes! Absolutely love this gem.

I call this place value fine dining! Where else can you find a place that serves a killer 3 course meal at $35? You also have the option of adding a 4th course for only $10. Their menu changes on a daily basis based on what's in season and what ingredients are available, definitely a reason to keep me coming back!Since their menu changes regularly, you likely will not get the same food I am reviewing. It's April and the spring season had just started, our meals had a very zesty, citrusy theme that awakened my taste buds, an indication that they use seasonal ingredients. Grilled Asparagus Salad - Lemon Streusel, Quail Egg, Grapefruit Hollandaise - crunchy asparagus served with a tiny poached quail egg! So creamy, citrusy and a great opener.English Pea Risotto - Grand Padano, Arugula, Crispy Prosciutto - The color was very enticing. I loved the lemony taste of this dish as well.Crispy-Skin Mt. Lassen Trout - Potato Fondant, Caviar, Pickled Red Onion - Classic, simple, yet delicious! Perfectly cooked trout, fresh fish, and I got to eat caviar! Fancy!Chocolate Roulade Cake - Wildflower Creameux, Naval Orange, Milk Chocolate Pine Nuts - This one didn't hit it out of the ballpark for me, though the presentation was beautiful.Take your girl here, parents, friends, co-workers, whoever! The ambiance is great and they have a good selection of wines. I'll definitely be back soon!

A perfect meal from start to finish!I had dinner here with my mom and we were both pleased with the experience. I had bookmarked it ahead of time and knew the menu would be a three course prix fixe style with optional pasta. My mom and I both had the burrata salad to start - full of fresh greens and more than just your average handmade burrata dish - tres bien! I loved the grit of the pepper to juxtapose the creamy cheese.I ordered the bass and mom had the short rib for the main course. We ordered the bucatini pasta and found the delicate but full flavor of the bucatini to round out the meal quite well. The bass was cooked to perfection and I ate every bit of it - rare for me as I usually avoid fishy parts of seafood. It was perfectly perched atop purple rice and sugar snap peas, creating a colorful masterpiece.For dessert I had the panna cotta - no decision-making needed there! It was a little on the sweet side, but the texture was perfect. Mom ordered the other option, a chocolate crunch concoction with marshmallows and cookie dough - again, perfectly meshing different textures and flavors - that came with ice cream. She and I were impressed overall and left feeling very satiated after our relaxed 2 hour meal. The menu here changes frequently, so call ahead if you want to know what is available. I highly recommend!

Three course prix fixe for $35 in SF. Add a pasta dish for $10. No wonder there's such high reviews here! The service is stellar - they change all your silverware & dishware and wipe the table between all of the courses. The interior is really clean and nicely decorated. It is on the darker side so has a nice romantic ambiance.I really liked the bread that they serve with a heaping scoop of butter garnished with salt and pepper. It's seriously so good...salt and pepper on butter is a game changer for sure. I came on a Sunday with last minute reservations and it got really full so make sure to make reservations if you're planning on coming here on a weekend.The food was all quite good. It wasn't standout but was delicious, and I think that's a good sign especially since the prix fixe meal was only $35 (I added pasta for $10, and the pasta was DELICIOUS too).As for the specific food I ate, I had a squash salad, squid ink risotto, salmon, and a coconut pudding. The squid ink risotto was my favorite out of all the dishes, but their dessert was so good that I had to finish it all even though I was super full after eating the first three courses. I'd highly recommend this place to someone looking for an affordable but nice meal!

The bf and I went to Trestle for a nice Sunday night just-for-fun dinner (: $35 for a 3-course prix fixe menu? Yes please!Trestle is located on the corner of Jackson and Columbus, and you might really miss it because it's very low-profile. We almost missed the restaurant because we were looking at eye-level for signage, but finally saw the giant lighted sign up above XDUpon walking in, I was a bit surprised that the restaurant was very small. It looks like it seats maybe 40 max and most tables are 4 toppers. You will hear your neighbors' conversations, and they will hear you :PThere is barely any standing room inside if you're waiting to be seated, BUT they're very fast at getting you seated. They've got their timing down pat -- The pair ahead of me got seated when they walked in, and our table was being cleaned and set up at the same time. The service is great, with only one hostess and 2 servers. They're really on top of clearing your table when you finish a course, filling your water bottle and cups of water, folding napkins if you get up to use the bathroom -- all of it! They change the utensils with every course, which is really nice but at the same time feels a bit wasteful =/ If you come in, do expect a bit of a wait to be seated if the hostess is busy. But it's not bad, like 5-10 minutes. Appetizer:- Smoked Salmon Salad: I order this and really enjoyed it! The salad was light and refreshing, but a bit salty. The salmon came blended like tuna salad vs. sliced, but that was kind of nice. I think that way it's easier to get some salmon in every bite. - Vegetable Minestrone: The boyfriend ordered this and it was a very hearty and creamy soup. It's not clear as I thought minestrone would be. They bring it out with veggies on the side, and then the server pours out the soup into the bowl.Pasta:We got one to share since we weren't super duper hungry.- Meyer Lemon Garagnelli: SO GOOD, I wold definitely recommend adding on a pasta to share. The pasta had a lovely hint of citrus rather than the lemon being all up in your face. The citrus was perfect with the cheesiness of the Parmesan. The portion was small but good for $10 and as an add-on.- Sea Urchin Risotto: This was the other option and it sounded a bit too rich (plus the boyfriend isn't a huge uni fan :P)Main: - Crispy-Skin Snapper: This came perfectly seared or grilled or baked or whatever they did to it. The dashi broth was super flavorful (salty on its own) and was great with the fish since it wasn't heavily seasoned. The dish also came with pickled radish, one stem of bok choy (lol) and some bits of mushroom.- Truffle-Stuffed Chicken: This was the other option, but we were both meh about it. Dessert:Disclaimer - I'm not a huge dessert fan. The bf loves sweets, but isn't a huge fan of American desserts.S'mores Bar - For both of us, this was okay. The marshmallow was very fluffy though!Lemon Tea Cake - I enjoyed this, but it's not something I'd care to order/eat again in the future. The cake was dense but not in a bad way, and overall it was a nice way to end a meal. The only lemon part was the tiny dollops of cream on the side. The Early Grey chiboust was my favorite part of this dish.We had a great dinner at Trestle and would recommend it to others looking for a cute date night/dinner spot that won't necessarily break the bank. Since the menu changes, I would definitely come back!

4.5 stars! I'm usually super iffy about restaurants that get numerous 5 star reviews. But wow, Trestle really delivered! For $35 and a 3-course pre-fixe menu (+$10 additional pasta course), it was well worth it.RESERVATIONS - Highly recommend making a reservation in advance via OpenTable. The restaurant itself is fairly small and tables are tight. You'll be able to hear your neighbors conversations--keep that in mind if you're planning to bring a date.FOOD - The s/o and I ordered alternating options on the menu, but both chose the snapper for our main.-Appetizers: Smoked Salmon Salad & Vegetable MinestroneThe smoked salmon was pureed and had a very similar flavor profile to the trout dip at State Bird Provisions. The vegetable minestrone was deliciously creamy with small bites of veggies all throughout.-Pastas: Meyer Lemon Garagnelli & Sea Urchin RisottoThe garagnelli was served in an extremely small portion and was very basic in flavor--I would pass on this. The risotto, on the other hand, was perfect. It was served with clams on top and was nice and rich--definitely worth ordering.-Main course: Crispy-skin SnapperThis came out and smelled extremely fishy. Once we started eating, however, it was very flavorful and light. The skin was actually very crispy! But overall, was probably my least favorite dish of the night.-Desserts: S'mores Bar & Lemon Tea CakeIf you're into chocolate, the s'mores bar is for you. It's served with dollops of passion fruit to complement the richness of the chocolate. The lemon tea cake is extremely fragrant, but I loved it! The earl grey chiboust was delicious--wish I could order an entire bowl of this!COST - For a 2-person pre-fixe dinner + 2 pastas, the total came out around $100 after tax and the SF mandate cost. Not bad considering we were pretty full. They also bring your check out in a little booklet, where you can write down a silly/memorable note for the next diners to see.SERVICE - Servers here are friendly and attentive. They'll come by fairly often to top off your water. CONS - You must explicitly ASK for their bread. TBH, I feel like they should offer this to every table. They serve Firebrand bread, toasted with butter and also included a healthy dollop of whipped butter with salt flakes & pepper--SO good! Also not sure if they have vegetarian friendly options, as I only saw fish + chicken as the main--something to keep in mind if you have any dietary restrictions. Lastly, there was a fairly long delay between our pasta dish and our main course. It was especially noticeable since our food came out consistently beforehand. Not sure what happened here.Overall - I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Trestle. Apparently they switch around their menu every week or so. Will definitely be back to try more dishes!

3 Course Prix Fixe Meal for only $35?? Sign me up!AMBIENCE: We came for dinner time and the house was full. It had a small, clean, and intimate setting. The low lighting made it feel inviting and romantic. You can definitely hear indistinct chattering amongst the other groups as it echos so you kind of have to talk loudly. It is located at Jackson Square and I believe it only seats 49. Beautifully decorated. FOOD: I believe the Prix Fix menu changes daily - which allow creativity to shine through from the kitchen and gives you more reasons to keep coming back! I have to be honest, I was very surprised to hear that their 3 course prix fixe menu was only $35 considering it is Michelin Star quality experience, but I am not complaining either. Every bite was delightful and the presentation of each dish was a work of art. I think it is more than just a place to eat, it is an experience you have to try for yourself. Our meal for Friday, March 10, 2016 (shared between two: see photos): Salmon Croquette, Sunchoke Bisque, Clam Tagliatelle, Mushroom Risotto, Roasted Prime New York, Crispy-skin Salmon, Chocolate Diablo Cake, and Lime Cacherin SERVICE: The service was exceptional. I would highly recommend making reservations, especially for groups. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. They explain what each course is as it is brought out to you. We came to celebrate a birthday and even brought a cake (hindsight: not a good idea as you'll already be stuffed by the time they serve the cake). They cut it up and served it for us and even provided candles and a card. I thought that was very sweet and kind of them. Highly recommend this place!

Came here for my birthday dinner on a Monday night before the 4th of July. The place was really busy even though it was after 8pm. Three course pre-fixe menu for $35 with pasta supplement for additional $10. I was with a party of three and we ordered everything on the menu. Upon being seated, I received a nice handwritten welcoming birthday card from the staff. Very nice gesture. The appetizer, main course and dessert I had was delicious. My party ended up having trouble finishing all the food. They allowed us to sample the wines that they offered by the glass which was very nice of them. We ended up ordering 2 bottles of wine, and even though we ended up being the last party to leave, they did not rush us and we finished both bottles of wine. Very lovely and affordable dinner.P.S. - don't forget to ask for bread and butter. It was delicious too!

Trestle has a three-course prix fix menu for $35. That, with a glass of wine and tip turned out to be about $60. There are two choices for each course, so my friend and I decided to get everything between the two of us (minus the optional pasta dish for an extra $10). Appetizer:Greek Salad - beautiful colorful plate. Not your usual Greek salad. Had a lot of radicchio, not sure if there was any dressing. Not a lot of flavor. Miso Soup - had some type of fried tempura on it, which is good when crispy, but turns soggy if you leave it in the soup. However, the soup was way too salty.Main:Crispy Skin Mt. Lassen Trout - by far the best plate of the evening. The skin was crispy and delicious. The fish was a good temperature and the accompanying vegetables were crisp and tasty.Roasted Pork Loin - two small wedges of overcooked pork. The portion of pork should have been doubled. If I weren't sharing the trout with my friend, I would be pretty bummed at the tiny portion of this dish.Dessert:Zeppole - you get three small balls of Zeppole. It was tasty, but would have been much better if the Zeppole were served hot and fresh from the fryer. Chocolate Angel Food Cake - a few small mounds of crumbled angel food cake. It was tasty generally.Overall, it was kind of hit or miss on each course. The desserts were solid. While $35 for a three-course meal sounds like a deal, the portions are small and I walked away a little hungry. I would recommend getting the pasta dish for an extra $10 if you're hungry. The plates were beautiful and the service was friendly and attentive. My water glass was always filled and they were quick to swap out the plates when we were done.

Upscale 3 course dinner for $35!! We had a reso for 6. Our server Danielle was excellent and even served the birthday cake one of our friends brought in. We all ordered wine and beer with our meals and they were great. We ended up adding $10 to our meal for the chance to try the clam pasta with uni butter. Menu changes daily.The place was small, cozy, clean, and full. It was hard to hear conversations at times. I'd go back if I ever visit San Fran again. Probably not a place to go to if pressed for time, even though service was timely. I feel this experience should not be rushed. There was no wasted food and all our plates left the table licked clean. :)Sunchoke bisque of golden raisins, toasted pine nuts, and pickled sunchoke: creamy smooth, really liked the pickled sunchoke because it was interesting. However, i would have personally enjoyed pepper or more spice to the bisque. Otherwise you have to ensure you get the other ingredients to not end up with a bite that's left wanting.Clam tagliatelle with uni butter, lemon segments, and chervil: noodles were great but I was somewhat disappointed because I couldn't figure out where the uni was. The dish tasted like a cross between mac and cheese and alfredo to me.Roasted prime new york with cauliflower puree, crushed fingering and perigord sauce: portion was smaller than expected but I was already getting full from our previous courses. This course was perfect. The meat was medium rare (my preference) and the sides were flavorful and complimentary.Lime vacherin with guava cremeux, olive oil cake, and champagne jelly: I selected this because of the olive oil cake, which I tried somewhere else for the first time and loved it. This was not an exception. The lime vacherin was more like a meringue and all the other unique components of the dessert tasted fantastic solo or together. The champagne jelly was my favorite! It's too bad I may never get to experience this dessert again because I'd get it every time.

Like everyone had already mentioned, $35 for a prix-fixe menu and an additional $10 for the supplement. Trestle is also known to be Stone Throw's sister restaurant so what a steal! But unfortunately, I think my friends and fellow Yelp reviewers hyped it up too much for me and was a bit disappointed with the cuisine.The highlight of the meal was probably the supplement: Garganelle Bolognese. This was actually r.e.a.l.l.y. good. Skip out on the Squid Ink Conchiglie as it was just mediocre and also better made at Stone Throw. Was a bit too chewy and a bit too flavorless for my liking.The food wasn't bad nor was it amazing; to be honest, the supplement pasta dish was actually my favorite. But if you add the supplement, then it's technically $45 for your dinner... then add a drink and your meal can easily come out to $110+ for 2 people. If that's the case, then is the price actually a good deal? Debatable... but I'd still try it for the experience. Besides that, the experience was nice and the decor was quaint and very SF, but I don't think I'll be back again.

One of my favorite dining experience in San Francisco! I got a reservation for two people at 7.15 on a Friday night. Our table was ready when we arrived. Place is fairly small and with a romantic atmosphere.It's a prix fixe menu ($35) with two options for each dish. My boyfriend and I got the wedge salad as an appetizer, we shared one risotto (+$10), I got the red snapper and he got the steak. For dessert I got the chocolate semifreddo and he got the cardamom cake.Dont forget to ask the firebrand bread, it comes with seasoned butter and is amazing!Food was delicious, crunchy, fresh and surprising. The meat and fish were perfect. The crunchiness of the fish skin was everything. Service is awesome too. Staff is really nice and tells you what each dish is. Food came quickly too!Highly recommend!

$35 - 3 course meal. Changes daily (with some occasional repeats) I got a 5:30 weekday reservations the night before and it looks like they had a bunch of open times. Honestly I don't really remember the details of every dish. Come to share so you can try everything. Dishes were your standard American fare so it's not a huge portion. However, the two of us did pay the extra $10 to try the pasta of the day. I'll let the pictures speak for itself. The taste was good but it won't blow you away. If it wasn't for the price then I would've given it 3 stars. Service was superb but the tables are WAY too close to each other. I was bumping elbows with the people next to me. Not a great place to have a conversation since the space is small already so the noise just amplifies. Overall, due to the price I would recommend coming for special occasions. But beware of tight spaces while dining and you have to be okay with being veerrrryy close to the person sitting next to you.

For those times you're looking for good food, but you don't want to think to much and just want the night to take over.Honestly, can't really go wrong here. I recommend getting the pasta course, one serving for each two people if you guys can't eat that much. Everything was great. Me and my friend tried everything on the daily menu and it was fantastic. My main course of steelhead trout was seared as opposed to cooked all the way through, which was an interesting experience.Good service, friendly staff, water filled without asking and courses came out in a steady pace. Spent around 2hrs from getting seated to getting the check. Super small environment, I counted maybe 15 tables in the entire place. It gets pretty loud as well, if there was one complaint I would recommend getting some sort of sound dampening as the roof is pretty high and sounds can echo to the point where it's kinda hard to hear.My new favorite restaurant in SF for some casual fine dining.

Our waitress had a very curt, rude tone all throughout dinner. One of my companion had a shellfish allergy, the other an alium sensitivity. We told her, yet, somehow my companion with the shellfish allergy started feeling extremely nauseous and ill after the meal. She ended up vomiting all night long. There was raw onion on the plate for my companion with Alium hypersensitivity...When we told her about the hypersensitivities, she was very dismissive. We're truly concerned that she didn't relay the message to the kitchen, and there may have been some contamination... Food is so great. Wine list is on point. I'm so disappointed that the waitress totally ruined our mood throughout dinner :(

What a gem of a place! The location is on the cusp of Chinatown and Columbus (actually it's at this interesting intersection, similar setup as Comstock Saloon).We came here for dinner (dinner reservation at 9:00PM. When we arrived, there were a few other parties waiting to be seated, they were running 10mins behind). I was surprised that the place was still packed so late in the evening - so definitely would recommend that you make ressies!We did the prix fixe menu for 2 ($35/person). Includes 1 appetizer, 1 main and 1 dessert (the simplicity of the menu was awesome, you had 2 choices for apps, 2 choices for main, 2 choices for dessert) so we just ordered one of everything. Oh also, you could add pasta/risotto for $10 so we did that too...hahaha so much for dieting!Great service, nice ambiance, good date night place, super reasonable pricing. Had a few glasses of wine so the tab was ~$125 + tax and tip.

Menu varies so check it out online before you go. Nice idea to have a prix-fixe menu with set items. Food was excellent. Shared pasta addition: BROCCOLI DI CICCIO BUCATINI - Caper Beurre Blanc, Preserved Lemon, Chili Flake - fantastic, probably due to the butter, would have happily eaten a whole bowl by myself.Main course: CRISPY-SKIN MT. LASSEN TROUT - Sweet Corn, Cipollini Petals, Jimmy Nardello Pepper - possibly my first time eating trout but I loved it, reminds me of my other fave fish - salmon. Perfectly cooked.Had a bite of my friend's beef dish & it was delicious also. Less excited about the minestrone appy & chocolate dessert but overall the meal was very good.Excellent service.Took off a star due to the noise level. Above average noise & I found myself shouting at my friend or straining to hear. Just my preference to eat in a quieter environment.Will eat here again (& again).

4 stars for the food but +1 star for the service and customer focus.I had a college friend visiting from out of town, and we made plans to catch up over dinner at Trestle, where I had been meaning to try out for months. I made the reservation a week in advance for 8 pm on a Tuesday and was super excited as I was walking up to the restaurant...until the hostess checked her iPad and said she couldn't find my reservation. Turns out silly me accidentally made the reservation for the following Tuesday. The hostess said she wouldn't be able to seat us for another hour or so, so as we started trudging dejectedly away towards Chinatown in search of another restaurant, the hostess ran after us and told us she might actually be able to work something out. And she did!What I love about Trestle is the pure simplicity in ordering. With the $35 3-course menu with two options for each course, the only decisions you have to make are whether to get A or B for each course, and whether to get the optional $10 pasta supplement and which one. It made the ordering process much simpler.I loved the pasta dish I got, but I was full after the first two courses of appetizer and pasta and really struggled to finish the last two courses. I would highly recommend getting it, but maybe sharing it with the rest of your group.The options on 10/18 when we went were (* indicates what we picked), though this seems seems to change on a daily/seasonal basis:~~Appetizers~~Little gem salad: duck liver mousse, candied peanuts, persimmon*Cream of leek soup: crispy potato, bacon lardons, chives~~Optional $10 pasta course~~*Garganelli bolognese: calabrian chili oil, burrata, basilMushroom risotto, porcini, black truffles, grana padano~~Mains~~*Crispy-skin striped bass: vadouvan cauliflower, brussels sprouts, lobster emulsionFried quail: fingerling potatoes, coleslaw, BBQ jus~~Desserts~~White pepper financier: black mission figs, pecans, vanilla ice cream*Chocolate budino: bartlett pears, blue cornbread, aperolI loved everything I had except for the dessert, which I thought was just okay but not outstanding like the rest of the courses.I love creamy soups, and the cream of leek soup was done perfectly with exactly the right amount of flavor and consistency. The crispy potato and bacon bits in the soup were a pleasant surprise. I always enjoy it when the server pours the soup into your bowl, and that's what they did here.I've never had garganelli pasta before, but it was really good here with the meaty bolognese sauce. I asked for the chili oil to be served on the side since I wasn't sure how spicy it was, and our server was very accommodating about my request. My friend got the mushroom risotto, and after trying the garganelli, said that while the risotto was pretty solid, he liked the garganelli more.I'm usually a big fan of bass, and I thought the bass here was very well done, the main difference between the bass I've had here vs other places was the crispy skin. Maybe it comes from growing up in a Chinese household, but the fish skin is one of my favorite parts of the fish (more so than the meat), and they did a great job with it here. The brussel sprouts were a pleasant surprise in this course as they were cooked with spices and had a pleasant curry taste to them.The chocolate budino was kind of like a pudding, but I thought the various "toppings" that it was served with were all over the place and didn't form a very cohesive dish.Service was also great. Our server was very attentive and our water glasses were never empty.With the extra $10 pasta course, my total came out to around $60 after tax and tip.

4.5 stars.What we loved about this place were the ambiance and 'health factor' of the food by which I mean the minimal amount of butter/cream that went into making the meal. What I didn't like too much was the service which was mediocre. Our grim-faced waiter didn't look too pleased to be working tonight. The tables are very close to each other so you will really have to talk quite loud to have a conversation. But that didn't bother us too much..

My boyfriend and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary at Trestle. There was a small group of people waiting by the door when we came in. We all had reservations and I guess some of the tables were taking longer than expected. After about 10 minutes of waiting, a member of the staff brought us 2 glasses of sparkling wine and apologized for the wait. We weren't even seated yet and I was already impressed with the service. I love the simplicity of their menu: 3 courses, choose 1 of 2 options per course, $35 per person. You can order pasta for an additional $10.- Appetizer: we both ordered the calamari salad and the portion was quite large for an appetizer. The sliced peppers added a nice kick and the salad greens were topped with a generous serving of fried calamari. - Mains: we both ordered the crispy salmon skin. The salmon was cooked to perfection/seasoned very well and my only complaint is that I wish there was more of it on the plate!- Pasta: my boyfriend ordered the short rib tagliatelle and I ordered the creamy polenta. Both pastas were tasty but I loved the mushrooms and the incredibly smooth/rich texture of the polenta.- Dessert: I ordered the milk chocolate mousse and my boyfriend ordered the deconstructed apple pie. My mousse dessert looked like a whimsical work of art and I loved all the textures/colors/flavors present. The deconstructed apple pie was not as satisfying as an actual slice of pie, but all the flavors of an apple pie were there. We had a great time and an amazing dinner at Trestle. Their menu is constantly changing and all of the menu options look incredible every single time I check the website. I cannot wait to come back!

Trestle made its way right into my heart, easily one of the best proper meals I've had in the city so far. And with $45 for four courses or $35 without the pasta, I can see myself coming back here quite often. A word of advice: do not give up on the pasta. It's so worth the extra $10. The dishes are beautifully presented and the combinations go really well together. I loved everything about it, but the pasta (Uni Bugatini) and the dessert (Chocolate Cake Sundae) were definitely the most memorable. Service was on point and super friendly. I felt very well taken care of. Definitely something for a more special occasion, like date night or a great dinner with friends.

5 stars for the price, the price fixe selection, and the beautiful plating. Reservations are needed, but not too difficult for a weekday evening. One thing is that the dessert course is a skimp - usually some mousse or other.

Undoubtedly one of the best value dinners you can get in San Francisco. $35 price point for a multi course meal is hard to find (even during restaurant week these days). Personally I also find it very appealing to know more or less exactly how much dinner is going to be, especially if you're dining with people whose taste or tendency to order really expensive stuff might be unknown. So money talk out of the way, some other things to know about this restaurant -Pasta supplements are a must! Recommend ordering to share, roughly one of these per two people. Trying more is more. If you have multiple people, order different stuff among you. The daily menu doesn't change that much in any given week so if you want an idea of what you're going to eat, check the website a few days or even as much as a week or so in advance. The soups are almost always a pretty cool production, involving a variety of ingredients and pouring liquid in front of you tableside. Wine / beer only, if you're wanting a cocktail, Comstock Saloon is very nearby. Restaurant is a small space. You're likely to be sitting very close to one or more other parties and I don't really recommend coming here with more than 4-5 people (6 is doable but very tight).

I found Trestle in a list from San Francisco Eater & was intrigued by the $35 prix-fixe & all the good reviews. My husband & I were thrilled with every course! The potato leek soup was a standout. We also enjoyed the little gem shrimp salad. I loved the pumpkin risotto with baby zucchini, pickled red onions, & hazelnuts. Both main courses, crispy skinned salmon & mushroom stuffed chicken were delicious--the chicken was the winner. We both chose the chocolate verrine for dessert. It was truly amazing! What a perfect dinner! We left full but not uncomfortable. Loved every bite!!

Good deal at $35 for 3 courses, but it adds up with the costs of drinks/wine, bread and the pasta supplement. The restaurant is small and nicely decorated, but it is very loud; my date lost his voice trying to scream all night across the table. They also schedule tables too close together. We had a 6:15 reservation for four, and by 8:20, we got the "Is there anything else I can offer you?" subtle/polite request for us to leave. This person also said that the people have been waiting for half an hour to sit down at our table. If that is true, that means they scheduled an 8:00 reservation, leaving only 1.75 hours for our reservation for 4 to have a 4 course meal. The food was good, with nice thought to textures in each dish. The pasta is worth getting and was perfectly cooked. My salmon was cooked right, with very crispy skin and tender inside. The dessert was my favorite. It was chocolate cake, marshmallows, cookie dough, vanilla ice cream with almonds and pomegranate seeds for that crunch and tartness. Excellent dish.

Amazing food at an incredible value.3-course tasting menu for $35?! An extra optional course for an additional $10?! Advice from a friend - always opt for the pasta course. I've come here a number of times with friends and family alike. Trestle tops my list of SF restaurants I recommend unilaterally. The menu changes frequently and the service is great as well.

I took my boyfriend to Trestle for his birthday dinner on a Sunday night. Luckily I was able to snag a reservation a few weeks earlier since we had a last minute change of plans! I've been wanting to try Trestle for a while now so I figured this would be the perfect opportunity! You can't beat a 3 course, prix fixe menu for $35, with optional $10 pasta supplement!We ordered one of everything on the menu, including the pasta supplement. Our first course was butternut squash soup and a beet and chicory salad. The soup definitely won us over early in the dinner. It was smooth, creamy and flavorful, and I loved the diced squash and walnuts included. Our pasta supplements were lobster risotto and garganelli with tomato and broccolini. The garganelli was underwhelming, but we enjoyed the lobster risotto. For entrees we had the crispy skin salmon and the braised beef shortribs. Both were divine! I love crispy skin on salmon because crunchy food is my favorite texture! The salmon was cooked perfectly and the veggies and grapes complemented the fish. The braised beef shortribs were super tender and you could pull it apart with a fork! This also had some charred eggplant and crispy onions that paired perfectly with the slightly sweet meat. By the time we finished our entrees, we were stuffed! Somehow we still finished dessert though, which was a diablo cake (basically chocolate cake) and coconut custard. The diablo cake came with ice cream, peanut mousse, and sweet and salty peanuts. So much texture in one little bite! The coconut custard was my favorite, and I don't even like coconut. The pandan creme, toasted coconut flakes, and lime shortbread definitely brought the dessert together.Don't set your heart on any one item on the menu, because it seems like it changes pretty frequently, if not every day! One thing I do like about the menu is the simplicity, as well as the variations of food. For example, they usually have a soup or salad for appetizer, fish or meat for entree, and something chocolate-y/richer and a fruity dessert. There's really something for everyone to order, or you can share everything like my bf and I did!Service was super friendly, they definitely know fine-dining but in a more casual setting. Waters were always filled and waiters frequently came around, making sure that our dining expereince was going well. My only gripe is that the tables were pretty close together, so conversations are pretty loud and it can be less intimate. Other than that, no complaints!

You'd be surprised how often I receive texts from friends that read like "YO I need to plan a date for this weekend that seems really nice but is actually affordable (spent all my $$ on SF Rent)"Normally that would seem impossible, but I'm thrilled to now have a recommendation for this very occasion. At $35/person for a three-course prix fixe menu, Trestle is a steal.From the ambiance, to the service, to the amazing dishes, I loved every aspect of my meal. I won't go into detail about each dish because they change their menu daily. Although there are a few supplement courses (I tried them all, obviously), you will likely be full off the 3-courses.

This place is so delightful! The standard prix fixe menu is, on its own, quite affordable at $35 for an app, entree, and dessert. You can add a pasta (which I highly recommend) for $10. The wine menu is well curated, although fairly pricey. Again, worth it.While the kitchen knocked it out of the park, the highlight of the evening was the exuberant hostess. She was friendly, knowledgeable and really made the experience. Our server was a bit unpleasant, to say the least, but she made up for it in spades.

My wife and I were recently in San Francisco for a week, and Trestle was probably my favorite restaurant of all the ones we visited.The atmosphere was both lovely and lively. The place was PACKED. I strongly suggest a reservation. Everyone I noticed was really enjoying their dinner.What struck my wife and I most about Trestle was that each course from the prix fixe menu was pretty different from what we expected. We both ordered the minestrone soup and it was absolutely unlike any minestrone I've ever had before, but it was also delicious!I suggest if you're eating with your partner, that you share the optional plate. The pasta that we had was superb, but would have filled me up completely if I had had it by myself.The price was perfect - at $35 for the three course meal, plus the $10 pasta, plus a bottle of wine, this meal ended up being the biggest bang for the buck that we spent on dining in San Francisco!We both loved Trestle, and since their menu changes every month, if we lived nearby, it would definitely be on our regular rotation.

this is my go-to place for a cheap & cheerful night out that is still nice enough to dress up a little if you want. the main thing is that the food is really good! menu is $35 for 3 coures, with add-ons, but with some wine, maybe the add on dish, and tip, it can end up being about $75-$100 per person which is still reasonable for a nice meal out in SF. I've sometimes just come here for the 3 courses and just water becauze ive been dieting and/or not drinking for a particular reason, and it comes out super cheap, considering that food is healthy and good! the only thing is that sometimes is gets really loud, and may be a bit dark to read menu.

A nice restaurant in SF at a good location for $35 is a good deal! I'm very happy to discover this gem. Ordering was very easy. Between the 2 of us, since they had 2 options for each course of the meal, we naturally ordered one of everything on the menu and shared everything. Plus a risotto to share. Tasty! The butternut squash soup was very smooth. Salmon entree cooked perfectly. The mushroom risotto was delicious too, with various kinds of wild mushrooms and a very nice addition of a pickled onion, adding a little tartness to the creamy dish. We really enjoyed the evening and the dining experience. Even though with everything including sparkling water, tea, tip, our bill came out to be around $120, it's still overall a worthwhile meal. Very happy about this place.

I absolutely love the concept of having a course dinner without breaking the bank! I mean $35 for a 3 course meal in San Francisco?! Unheard of!The menu changes frequently, so as other reviewers have mentioned, don't get your hopes up in expecting to try something one person had last week, because most likely it'll be different when you come. There's two options to choose from for each course, so we decided to get 1 of everything to try the menu, and added the mushroom risotto as a supplement to share. I had a glass of the tempranillo blanco to start which was light and refreshing. BF had the Yoho which is a Japanese IPA which I thought was really good as well (and that's coming from someone who doesn't like IPA). We also requested to try the bread, which I recommend! Each piece comes off the grill toasted with their butter on the side. Perfect for using to scoop up any sauce!Our first courses were the tomato soup and the calamari and shrimp ceviche. The melon in the tomato soup was a nice touch, but the soup was standard. The ceviche was delicious. It wasn't too acidic and I loved the shrimp chips that came with it. Our risotto came out next and this was soooo good. Risotto was creamy and nicely cooked. Loved the mushroom sauce that came with it to really give it that umami flavor. For the main courses, I had the Crispy-Skin Striped Bass which was perfectly cooked. It wasn't dry at all. The lobster emulsion sauce paired with the fish nicely. BF had the Berkshire Pork Duo and he thoroughly enjoyed it!For dessert we had cinnamon doughnuts and chocolate brownie. The cinnamon doughnuts were dense but not overly sweet. Loved the hibiscus glaze! The chocolate brownie was good as well, but not spectacular. Service was super attentive!I highly recommend making a reservation and giving Trestle a try!

Loveddd Trestle. They offer a prix fixe 3-course menu which they change regularly for $35 or with an added pasta supplement for $45. The place is small so I don't recommend coming with a group larger than 5 or 6 people, and I managed to get a reservation for a Thursday night at 5:30pm. They were named one of the Top 100 restaurants in SF so definitely worth trying, but I would recommend making a reservation since even after 5:30 they place was fully filled.The interior is simple with a modern, rustic feel with the wooden tables. Everything I ordered was superb. I got the chicken tortilla soup that was like a warm, creamy soup with latin flare. Did not get any pasta unfortunately, and for the entree I got the crispy-skin striped bass. The skin was definitely crispy, flavorful, and the combination of textures from the fish, the beans, and the calamari was delightful. Finally, for dessert, the huckleberry coffee cake had the perfect presentation and not too fluffy nor thick. My friend got the caprese tart as an app and the chocolate pound cake for dessert, also very tasty although I preferred my choices haha.

Well-designed cozy space near Jackson Square. The prix fixe is reasonably priced, and a couple dishes stand out, but overall the food hear didn't impress as much as their sister restaurants (Stone's Throw).SERVICEThe first couple of courses took quite a long time to come out. Overall the service was professional, but they messed up a bit. Our server asked us specifically if there were any dietary restrictions and my friend said he doesn't eat pork. They failed to mention that the dish he ordered has chorizo or to make any alterations to the dish. When this dish came out and we realized this mistake, they replaced it fairly quickly. APPETIZERS* Chicken Tortilla Soup - 3 starsI wasn't a fan, but my fellow diners liked this. I found this to be too heavy, the flavors didn't work well together.* Caprese Tart - 3.5 starsA lighter appetizer, fresh ingredients. PASTA* Garganelli Bolognese - 4 starsTasty sauce, meat, and great al dente pasta!* Ham & Pea Risotto - 4.5 starsMy fave dish of the night. Even without Ham, the texture was rich and perfect, the peas a nice refreshing crunch.MAINS* Crispy-Skin Striped Bass - 3 starsI found this a bit boring, the bass skin not very crispy, but my boyfriend enjoyed it.* Roasted Pork Loin - 3.5 starsInteresting fried pineapple and flavors, but the pork was very dry. DESSERTS* Passion Fruit Cake - 3.5 starsLight, good flavors, the cake was a little dry.* Chocolate Semifreddo - 3.5 starsThe honey gelee lacked flavor and was strange. The Salted Walnut Tuille was amazing. The cake was a bit dry.

Very pleasant experience here with great service and a menu that simplifies your choices. There are two choices for every course so it was a perfect setup for two people. The squid ink risotto and salmon entree are my favorites. Every course has interesting flavors. For instance, the tomatoes in the salmon dish have probably been cooked in vinegar and sugar, super flavorful

The food and service are absolutely phenomenal! The restaurant is located in Chinatown and you can almost miss it if you don't know where to look. Minimalist decor with tables around perimeter make it feel very open. We had early reservations, so we're some of the first to be seated. We each opted for three courses in the tasting menu, but split a pasta course between us. The first course was between a stone fruit salad and a butternut squash soup. It was SO GOOD! Creamy and sweet, laden with heavy cream, goat cheese, butter crumb and tender pieces of zucchini. The soup was poured with the condiments already stacked in the bowl. Next, the shared pasta course-an arugula pesto with bucatini -it was slightly bitter and tasty. The pasta was a little in the soft side, but the flavor was wonderful. Next, the main course. We both opted for a striped bass in saffron broth. The broth was a deep red and completely filled with beautiful saffron smell and flavor. It had tiny potatoes and chorizo to add to the deep taste. The fish was cooked perfectly and the skin crackled under each press of the fork. The final course, admittedly, was my least favorite but I am not a sweets person. I had a steamed lemon custard-very curd like with a strong lemony taste and tender short cake to accompany it. The staff was attentive without being overbearing-our water was never empty and our table was always clean and tended to. I would highly recommend for a group outing or if you are with another foodie and want to "discover" a menu together.

Straightforward, no non-sense dining. Menu is basically a 3-course prix fix and each course has two options to choose from. My wife and I chose different options in each course so we could taste all offerings. What can I say, all were delicious and service staff were very nice and fun to talk with. 5 stars.

This is officially one of my favorite restaurants in SF --hands down! Reservations can be difficult to make, so that may take some planning or coming here during unpopular hours. The surprise is that their menu is always changing, so that's fun and unique. While that creates variety, I can also be indecisive which is what makes me love this restaurant so much; they have a 3 course pre-set menu for $35 with only two options. So this is basically the perfect place for two with each person getting a different dish and sharing them.On the night I came, we started off with the Burrata and Chicory Salad and Roasted Chestnut Soup for appetizers. The salad was okay while the soup was exactly what I needed on a cold night. Next, we added the supplementary pasta for an additional $10. We chose the Mushroom Pappardelle, which was definitely a favorite of mine. The thick pasta covered in the creamy sauce and mushrooms with a poached egg on top was tasteful and fullfilling. By the time our main course came around, I was getting pretty full. We shared the Crispy Skin Salmon and Braised Beef Shortrib. The salmon had an Asian flavor, especially with the dumpling soup. The shortrib was good as well, but was a bit dry in my opinion. I couldn't even finish my half and left it to my date as I really wanted to save room for the dessert. This was the best part, especially because anything green tea wins my heart. We each ordered our own Green Tea Custard rather than trying the Carrot Cake. I seriously can't get over the creamy green tea custard topped with black sesame sprinkles for a nice texture. To add, there were bits of lychee and ginger cracker to please your tastebuds.Sidenote: The restaurant is close enough to walk off the wonderful meal couple with the Embarcadero just a couple blocks away. Lovely date night to say the least.

This place reminds me of Ad Hoc (without the cheese course). Priced WAY below that and the quality is on par with some of the best food that there is in the Bay Area.It's comfort food refined. In lieu of the reasonable price (3 courses for $35, plus a $10 optional pasta addition). You get a daily changing menu that includes an appetizer, an entree (and/or pasta) and dessert.The food that comes out of the kitchen is sublime, it's nothing that is fancy (think Chicken, fish, pork), but it's elevated and stepped up a notch. It makes it known that while this is food that you can cook at home, this is how it's suppose to be done by professional chef.It's a place I would come back to again and again. It's very good value. Make reservations ahead of time, this place isn't easy to get a spot.

It's a cute restaurant located near Chinatown. I love how they have two options for each course and the price is really affordable. The food was great but the portion is rather small; however, consider its price, I would say overall it's a pleasant dinner! Would love to return again! :)

35 bucks for a three course meal. Score.Beautiful presentation.Awesome service.Get the pasta supplement. You'll regret it if you don't. *10 bucksThis spot is perfect for a date night. You can order everything on the menu and share. After the first course, I was already making plans to return! They change their menu so you can come again and again.

You can't go wrong with the price. We got 2 preset dinners and alternated between the options and tasted everything. The service was great. They were attentive and brought out the next course when we were ready. It's nice to just sit back and let them take care of you. Definitely go with the pasta options as the plates are small. Presentation is lovely though. My favourite was the potato and leek soup in the starter. Request bread if you want it.The only downside is there isn't a waiting area. So if you're getting a drink while waiting for your table, you're kind of in the way.

Booked this place for my mom's birthday when she was in town. The 4 of us in our family each had the $35 fixed course and then shared 2 pasta supplements which was an additional $10 each (but worth it!). Service was top notch; our waitress explained the menu well, took time to ask after each plate if it was to our liking and was very accommodating to our request to add a Happy Birthday note and candle to our mom's dessert. The fixed menu that I had for the night consisted of:- Asparagus and falafel salad (5/5): Oh man. I'm not even that big a fan of asparagus but this stuff was good. Each one was charred just the right amount and had a great smoky taste while retaining some sweet tinges. The falafels were just the right amount of crisp on the outside and was savory and flavorful on the inside. Every part of the dish brought some unique, light flavors and different textures that made it one of the most delightful salads I've ever consumed.- Mushroom Pappardelle (4.5/5): The homemade pasta had just the right bite to it and the poached egg (after being broken and mixed in) provided a delicious creaminess while the porcini mushroom slices added some savoriness to compliment it. The prosciutto crisps were yummy but felt a bit salty and out of place compared to the rest of the dish though.- King Salmon (4/5): The salmon was cooked amazingly. Looked to be cooked probably 80% skin side down and the flipped at the end which made the skin crispy while the rest of the fish was tender and buttery. The bed of creamed corn was a nice touch of sweetness accomodate the fish. The beans that came on the side were well-seasoned but otherwise pretty average.- Dark Chocolate Mousse (5/5): I don't have much of a sweet tooth but this dessert was delicious. The mousse was light yet rich in flavor with some strawberry (or was it raspberry?) puree/jam that provided enough tart and sweetness to cut through some of the richness of the chocolate. Overall a really light dessert that wasn't overly sweet.I really enjoyed the menu on the night I went and managed to leave decently full as well. The ingredients feel fresh, vibrant and light unlike some other meals where I leave feeling heavy and weighed down by the food. I would definitely drop by again for another occasion!

Had a date here with my boyfriend and we were very impressed! As others have said, it's a three course prix-fixe at $35 per person and an additional $10 for a fourth course of pasta. The menu changes daily. You have two options for each course. I recommend that if you go with one other person, you get different things to share. (Except for the starter! We were told to ALWAYS get the soup, and it was not at all disappointing!)Very modern place to go, sort of a smaller dining area. Tables were really close, so it was a little uncomfortable practically sitting next to a few strangers and being able to hear their conversations. Wasn't too terrible to get used to and kinda zone them out though.Service was really nice, got seated for our reservation right away. Whenever we finished one dish, it was taken away very quickly and the next dish was on its way not even five minutes after waiting. Paced very well.Food was pretty amazing. My boyfriend and I got the fourth course just to try it, and I think we could've gone without it. The three course meal would've been the perfect amount for us to eat and be perfectly full without overeating. The risotto tipped it over the edge. Was a little salty as well. Favorites were the trout and the chocolate cake, seen in the pictures. The floral hints made the cake pretty unique. Would definitely go again!
