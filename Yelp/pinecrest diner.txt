Every time I'm in downtown SFO, I get quite the appetite from dodging panhandlers and head to Lefty O'Douls for some comfort food, but alas it has been shuttered, wtf. I kept walking and just as I was about to turn around I saw Pinecrest Diner sign and that was enough for me.Good choice, good food, good location and good times.

Sitting up abruptly, I rubbed my eyes and glanced around the dark San Francisco hotel room. It took me only a moment to recall where I was, note my wife still sleeping soundly beside me, and discover the two questions burning in my mind:Why, oh why, am I spontaneously awake at 4 AM?...and... How quickly, at this unholy hour, can I locate, acquire, and consume a bagel and egg sandwich?I never got an answer to the former, but a stat Yelp consult pointed me at the Pinecrest Diner, within one block of my hotel.I was seated immediately. Pinecrest is your basic American greasy-spoon diner, which is good, because that's precisely what I was looking for. The object of my ravenous craving was promptly delivered, along with a suitably oleaginous (look it up) side of hash browns. The scrambled eggs were slightly overcooked--but try to find a diner that does otherwise. (Good luck with that.) What the eggs lacked in finesse, however, they made up for in sheer mass. Sitting there in my little booth in pre-dawn San Francisco, I swear I could feel the gravitational pull they exerted on my fork. This was, indeed, the breakfast of my prematurely interrupted dreams.Pinecrest only takes cash, so don't get caught unprepared. They've got a generic cash machine in the corner, but I wouldn't touch that thing with YOUR ATM card, if you know what I mean.But if you've got a Jackson burning a hole in your pocket, and you're looking for a place where nobody knows your name--one that's open 24/7 for the sole purpose of satisfying your deep and immediate need for classic American diner fare--you could do worse than Pinecrest Diner.

At 2am everything tastes wonderful and so does this place ;-)) It's probably the only time I have ended up here for a greasy breakfast, nachos, burgers and so on. I don't think I have set foot in here during daytime ;-)) I like diners and they are a pleasure after a long night out with friends. I like the nachos here and they load it up pretty good. They are quick, efficient and get you out as soon as possible. I will end up here again for sure. It happens every time I am in SF ;-)) It's good value for money and quick to get a nice variety of food late at night.

Pinecrest came through and saved the day, curing our late night hunger pangs. There's nothing better than a diner open late. And if you're hitting the diner after midnight, that means you need to get breakfast, right?I went for the classic eggs over easy with sourdough toast, sausage and hash browns. Everything was great! The sourdough toast is standout - carbs are life. Also, SF sourdough is the best sourdough. Fact. The portion was huge too - 4 halves of toast, 2 eggs, half a plate full of hash browns, and 4 sausage links. Definitely ate it all. *clean plate club*The burger my friend had was delish too - charbroiled on the grill with a sesame seed bun. Classic and simple. Also, surprisingly the bacon Mac and cheese was bomb! The cheese sauce was well made and had that tangy cheddar thing going on. Definitely worth it for a late night stop! I also heard there's some history to the place making it a good SF experience.

3 years later and Pinecrest Diner earns an additional star from me! Same scenario... late night eats after a night out at the bar, but a much better foodie experience this go-around.I'm almost embarrassed to admit my order, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut (literally) and indulge. So, that being said... I ordered the bacon mac and cheese with a pancake on the side. That's right, you read correctly. Mac and cheese with a side pancake. #YOLO.Luckily, calories don't count when you're traveling (right?) so I have no shame in saying that this bacon mac and cheese was delightful. It was sooo cheesy with the cheese melted in and sprinkled on the top and had just the right amount of bacon in it. Plus, it oddly came with a side of buttered toast which was weird, but I didn't mind it since my stomach could use some extra carbs to soak up my beverages. The pancake was pretty standard but the perfect sweet to my savory.My last experience here was a win in my eyes. Gotta appreciate those late night food spots! Plus, pancakes are the trendy new night cap... didn't you know?Okay, I made that up. Not a bad idea though, am I right? ;)

American sized breakfast!Corned beef hash with 2 eggs ($12.95 USD) and House Omelet ($11.95 USD)The corned beef hash was good, double the hash since it comes with the hasbrowns as well. Loved the hash, especially the burnt parts cause it was extra crispy. The house omelet came with mushrooms, tomatoes and cheese. The egg was still quite runny so wasn't much of an omelet imo, more like just scrambled eggs. I really wonder how many eggs they used to make this omelet tho!Best part is, it's 24 hours!

During our first night in SF, we went to check into Hotel Epik and decided we wanted to have a last meal before heading to bed. We looked up 24 hr food since it was after midnight and thought this place would be a perfect fit.If this scenario sounds like your current situation, don't follow what we did, which was walk from Hotel Epik to this restaurant... 15 min doesn't sound too bad right? WRONG. Maybe it's because I'm not from here, but the walk from our hotel to this place was super unpleasant...trash and bums everywhere, people yelling and threatening us..they could tell us two girls weren't locals. TAKE A CAR, UBER OR TAXI if you aren't comfortable in these situations.But literally when you turn the corner to this restaurant, the vibe went back to relaxed and safe it was surprising Now on to the good stuff. The food! I really enjoyed my pesto chicken sandwich with fries and my friend's mac and cheese was really delicious. Her mac n cheese came with shredded cheese that eventually melted so perfectly. I recommend both meals The place itself was pretty packed during around 1am... mostly people who looked like they just came back from drinking. No wait this time though The service was just okay. We were in a booth in the corner by the entrance and we felt like the server forgot about us. Either because they were busy or we were kinda tucked away from his view... or a combination of both. Even the table next to us had the same service, asking us how long it took us to get the guy to talk to us. When the server did come around, he was really friendly Took a taxi back home because we felt like our lives were worth a $5 ride at 2-3am

Let me start off my saying this place is really small! It may seat 50 people at most! There's not a designated waiting area so you may be waiting outside and this morning, it was really cold. We got stuck at a table right in front of door. People were coming in and out and holding the door wide open so, I felt like we were eating outside. Wait staff were moving fast and seemed overwhelmed. Food wasn't that great. Mainly the french toast...it appeared to be overcooked. I'll pass next time!

Good place for a cheap meal. Nothing special. Waiters were pretty slow but friendly. I ordered the pinecrest breakfast special. The sausage and eggs were good the pancakes were very average and a little rubbery. Go here for late night if you want breakfast drunchies, other than that, there are better places in the area. I won't be going back anytime soon, but again, not terrible. You really get what you pay for.

Due to the line of people out the door waiting for breakfast (on a Monday) I was expecting something absolutely incredible. The city slicker in me should have known not to be that optimistic for a place with a line full of tourists out the door. Once we finally got in, I ordered the french toast. I've had better, it was very dry. But the service was very friendly and efficient. I would come again if there was no wait. It's just your good basic diner; nothing that incredible going on.

Ducked in here to study for an hour before my server gig. Technically they require $7 minimum per person, but I asked the waitress nicely if I could just order a tea. She let me do it :) Standard yogi green tea teabag. Gave me a big slice of lemon as well, which really enhanced the basic tea.For whatever reason, I kept smelling piss from somewhere. Not sure if it was coming from somewhere in the restaurant or from outside. Oh the joys of being in SF.

Great little place in the heart of SF! We stayed at the Union Square Hilton downtown so this was a short block walk from the hotel. There's always a line outside (the place is 24 hrs) but it moves pretty quickly. Think we only waited about 5-10 min. The food is amazing! Perfect portion sizes! We shared The Spanish Omelette w/ English muffin and a short stack of pancakes. Great tasting food, great service! No wonder this place has been here since 1969! Will definitely return on our next visit!

I have been coming to Pinecrest for a long time, but last night, it was not so impressed. I like to come here on Friday for clam chowder soup which is my bf and I love. It was so busy as always, and we were waited to order for 20 mins. We waited anyway. Drink came out fast as usual. I ordered hot chocolate. When i first tasted it, I could taste that it was not the same hot chocolate I had here. kinda salty and weird sweetness, so i asked them if they change sugar or chocolate. he said they change chocolate and it comes in a small bag. I dont know what brand of hot chocolate it is, but if the owner is reading this. The old chocolate is totally better. not sure if they want to reduce the cost or anything, but i never taste hot chocolate like this!! really dislike itAlso, the clam chowder soup was not good as we had before. we both agree that it was too creamy and salty. This was my first time complaint about the soup. I was so obsessed with it, but if they want to keep it this way. we might have to find somewhere else.

Popular in the mornings, most likely because it's surrounded by swanky hotels. Good sized boothes. Got my water but never my coffee, but they were slammed and there's free coffee at the hotel. They never charged me for the coffee either, so it's all good.Standard American breakfast food and some with Spanish twists, like a chorizo omelet, for example. Less intimidating than my hotel's swanky restaurant where all the guests were in suits. This place was half the cost and plus you get to see your order being made if you sit at the counter. So... Entertainment!I got there exactly at 7 and beat the rush by minutes. By 7:30 there was a line out the door, but customers were checking out, so I guess it goes in waves.

We passed by this place many times and I'm glad we popped in one morning for breakfast. Pinecrest is a decent, solid diner with good service and great location. I enjoyed my pancakes, very well made. I like their decor, nice atmosphere, the place feels homey but isn't small, it's roomy and fun. Comfy booths. The menu has a bit of everything you might want for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is this spectacular? No, but they do a good job at decent, simple, fun diner food.

I love eating breakfast at Pinecrest Diner. My friend and I have been here twice, and are never disappointed. We were going to eat breakfast at a new place today, but decided to go back to the diner. We waited in line for about 10 minutes. We got seated at the bar, which was totally fine. It's always a good experience from the servers to the cooks to the people. I love the food portions and a hefty portion of avocado when asked for it. This will definitely be my breakfast place when I'm in the city.

The food is good and our waitress pleasant. But I give them two stars because the person managing the door literally telling us in the middle of a business meeting that we had to leave because people were waiting for tables.This rude behavior started 45 minutes after we arrived. We waited for a table too.We had already spent $40 plus tip on breakfast. We politely asked this person to leave us alone to finish our coffee and wrap up our meeting. He kept harrassing us to leave.I started shouting at this a**hole across the room telling him that I had never experienced such horrible hospitality and would never return.If you want decent diner food (open 24 hours a day) and you don't mind being rushed and treated like a wallet instead of a person, by all mean patronize this place.I will never set foot in this horrid place again. I am also a tour guide, so will make sure I tell my clients to avoid this place unless they want to just eat and run.

A combination of things gone bad. First, the waiter insisted on knowing which drinks we wanted even after we said we were not drinking. Then, we ordered a waffle that was pictured with strawberries. I asked to add banana and ice cream. The order was ready but sitting and waiting for the server to bring it to our table. The food was equally disappointing.The strawberries were so dry that I can only imagine they were pre-cut in the morning (we were there around 9:30pm) and the ice cream that was supposed to be strawberry flavor, tasted like some cough syrup.Lastly, the extra charges for my alterations made the desert cost double the price.So, just don't go there, it's not even clean...

Best poached eggs I've ever had. Often, when I order my eggs poached at other restaurants, they're not done quite properly. But these, time and again, are flawlessly poached. I come here once or twice a week for soft poached eggs with perfectly crispy bacon and the most heavenly hash browns. I like to hash up my breakfast and poached eggs make for the perfect egg without random fat. Save the fat for where it matters: bacon. It is said you can tell the quality of a cook by how many kinds of eggs they can cook: don't let them fool you - they can poach like any Michelin star I've been too. They sometimes don't like to poach during busy periods but if it's slow and you're a regular it's no problem. Sometimes I've overhead tourists being told they don't poach- not true, just come back a few times and ask again. It's a one of a kind, quirky place that keeps that old San Francisco feeling.

So we really enjoyed our dinner here, but... we didn't enjoy what happened after...We ordered the regular cheese and jalapeno nachos, which were delicious. Plentiful great-tasting cheese and jalapenos, and the tortilla chips were thick and perfect, just like festival nachos. I mostly made my meal on those, and barely touched my hot link and eggs meal, however the hot links were really good tasting in that too. The over easy eggs were also cooked perfect with the runny yolk I like.But, the nachos were most likely our downfall later.About a half hour to an hour after, we both had the worst bathroom problems we've had in a long time. And this was NYE, mind you, so it really put a damper to the beginning of our night. We guess it was the nachos as that's the only plate we shared. Could it be old cheese? I don't know. It tasted great, but there's definitely something wrong with that dish. About 3 hours later we recovered and had a great rest of the night. But man, that sucked.It's unfortunate because we really liked the food there, and they're open 24 hours. And bonus, they're near Ruby Skye! Oh well, I guess we'll have to find something else in the area for late night grub.

Super solid breakfast. It's a little pricey, but I think that is to be expected for that area. The portions are very generous, and it's classic greasy spoon goodness. Very prompt service, and everything was really tasty. It tends to get busy, and it's pretty small, so you may have to wait. I went for a late lunch (around 3pm), but still got breakfast, because that is how I roll. It was the perfect time to visit. Not very busy, plenty of counter space. I dig the classic vibe.

Very pricey, very salty, very shady service. My utensils were not clean. The server threw my plates on the table. Had an extremely bad attitude and then was really cocky but it caught up to her when it was raining and the floor was wet and she slipped and busted her head. Sometimes it's best to remain humble and provide good service cuz this will provide you a better tip. I feel bad for her and gave her a 15% tip a salad and nachos that were extremely salty and unedible cost me a whopping $50. I was extremely unsatisfied all around thinking that this would be a cool dive dinerbar with the local restaurants nearby that I'm a little bit more familiar with. Good luck here and I hope you enjoy it I thoroughly did not. But everyone's experiences will be different on any given day. I was there in a bad day and I was there with bad service and I will stay with bad food. I would not use the restrooms here if I were you. Everything inside the building past the doors smell like urine. Again it might have been just me but this is on a Sunday evening when it was not busy to receive this type of service or food and apparently no care for the conditions of the place to eat if I had known this before hand I would have not engaged in any kind of food had a soda and went across the street.

Their first location burnt down, but you can still feel the love in their food and atmosphere.

Had dinner here. Fast friendly, greasy. I did see the line for breakfast several mornings. It was quite long each time.

This place had a weird smell when we walked in and we never really got used to it. other than that, short wait for the food, not too crowded at 9pm. I got a delicious and hefty amount of Pastrami on my Pastrami on Rye. The bf got a great cheese burger and chili fries. Delicious diner. We would come back!

A convenient diner located a few blocks from Union Square. Me and my friend were strolling one morning and we saw this place. There's a really long line so we assume it's very popular. We decided to try this out first thing in the morning the next day. We came in around 7am before the influx of people. It's a no frills, old-fashioned diner. Nothing fancy. The food is very delicious and servings are big. If you love breakfast this is a good place to go to. Downside is like mentioned, it's very touristy and popular so expect long lines and waiting times.

Food is ok. Soggy waffle. Ok hash browns.Coffee is excellent.They RUSH you to leave but then when you ask them for anything they ignore you. How can you leave when they won't bring you a bag and container for your leftovers?Bathroom - gross. Just gross. Down 3 flights of greasy stairs. Dirty. Smelly. They lost 2 stars just for this alone.

The onion rings were great but the pancakes and the waffle were tough. I will try this place again, however.

This was definitely a good place to venture. It was within walking distance of our hotel and we did not know what to expect. They were very accommodating to large crowds and very busy. But despite their busy wait staff they were still friendly. I ordered the Portobello Mushroom sandwich which came with fries which I substituted with sweet potato fries. Generous portions. Definitely a good selection. I did go the healthy route in order to try out their dessert. I opted to get the banana split and it is definitely worth a try. The presentation and condiments involved in the banana split was pretty involved and I commend the staff for how fast their service is. Overall great food and fast service.

Love the Pinecrest special. Their bacon and sausage are super crispy, just the way I like it. Everything was cooked to perfection, and it's one of my favorite diner in SF. Wait in line wasn't so bad, probably around 15 minutes or so. But it's worth it!

Best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. Service was what one would expect from a diner. It was a very satisfying meal.

Tasty comfort food at a reasonable price. My wife had a albacore tuna sandwich which she said was fresh and tasty. It was more then she could eat though. I had a mushroom and cheese omelette smothered with homemade chili. It turned out to be a delicious combination. Went around 8 on a Saturday night and had only a 10 minute wait before being seated in a comfortable booth. Although it was busy, service was great. Glad we tried it.

I ate here begrudgingly as unfortunately I was the only one in the group willing to wait 2 hours for a table at Brenda's. Regardless, I tried to embrace the diner concept and accept the fact that the place smelled identical to McDonald's. On a brighter note, the menu did at least offer me a chance to fit in a healthy meal. I went for a bowl of greek yogurt with fruit and was pleasantly surprised that the yogurt was the real unsweetened stuff. And the portion of both the yogurt and fruit was almost too much. Respect.The rest of my dining mates ordered more traditional breakfast options and seemed pleased enough. While I wouldn't classify Pinecrest as a destination diner when in a city so rich with breakfast food options, it is open 24/7 and will do the trick when you're not like me and don't want to wait in a huge a** line for higher quality food.

Cooks working hard, but food is not high-quality, meals not cooked well, extremely overpriced for the results you get

Hands down the best place for breakfast-based restaurant in downtown San Francisco! I had steak with eggs and I couldn't forget how flavorful my steak was. It melted in my mouth as I took a bite.However, the long wait would be the biggest issue. But it's definitely worth waiting for.

Classic diner fare for breakfast. Really long line in the morning though - lots of hotels / hostels around

Cool little place and the food looked really good. Ordered a sandwich and sat at the counter. The only scary thing was watching the guy cook my food. Grabbed raw chicken and bacon and then avocado. Then reached in the cooler and grabbed cheese. Made burgers with his hands and plated other food without a glove. He wiped his hands on his pants over and over and that was it. After watching I paid for my food to go. Paid and threw it away after what I witnessed. Please someone get the cook a glove. Between all the raw meats and touching what I saw was at least 7 other orders of food. Scary.

Arrived a bit after noon on a Monday. It's seat yourself and there was no wait, but it was busy. Service was prompt and food was great! I'd definitely come back.

I am use to coming here by myself because I figure they have good food this time they are so rude and I told them I wanted a booth they tried to force me to sit at a counter that I don't want to sit at and refuse to serve me even though I have been here several times..dont bother with this place

The 24 Hour breakfast is amazing. The food is delicious, quick and the service is good as well! It's a smaller diner so expect a wait.

Found this central downtown diner.It did not disappoint at all.The service was fast and friendly and we got to sit in the window.The drip coffee was great (and I mean really great) and the portion sizes were overly generous.This hit the spot and did not disappoint - it's very central so the price reflects this.We had pancakes and strawberries with a side of sourdough and two eggs and link sausages ( with amazing hash browns!!!!)It's a good, friendly and safe bet - which left our belly a full for a fully days San Francisco exploring - I'd defiantly go back !

Good food, fast service. Went on Sunday at 0730 and sat right down, but when we left at 0830 the line was already out the door and down the street! Around 20 people in line to sit. So get up early and go eat!

The atmosphere was very nice & the employees are friendly & attentive. The french toast I ordered was delicious & my husband liked the country fried steak he got as well. Would definitely return!
