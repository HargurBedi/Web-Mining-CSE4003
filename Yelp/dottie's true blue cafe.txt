Best breakfast I had in years. We had the 2 eggs, bacon, home fries and pancakes. Chocolate chip bread pudding and coffee cake. The bacon and home fries were outstanding. Bread pudding was good, but it had coconut which we didn't except. Coffee cake was great. Services was good and the server was very nice and knowledgeable on the menu. Wait- was to the side door and it was about 35 mins for a party of 2.Overall we didn't mind the wait and we will would definitely be back.

The food here is amazing. I've been here three times for breakfast. The first time I came I got the biscuit sandwich (a special of the day), the second time oatmeal, and the third time the chorizo scramble on the menu with buttermilk dill bread. That homemade biscuit and buttermilk bread were amazing. In the future, I'll always order bread because it is just so good. The only negative is that the portions are just so large and it is rather expensive. I'd prefer less food for less cost, as eggs aren't always the best leftovers.

I think I have found the love of my life in Dottie's. Any place that offers both cornbread and potatoes in the one dish, without judgement is my kind of place.The food was fantastic, very generous portions- so come hungry! Lovely service and bottomless diner coffee.

As you wait in line to get a seat at this popular San Francisco brunch spot, you will see many crackheads. I mean, the walls have signs that say something along the lines of, "this is not a place to pee, find somewhere appropriate." Of course, the people this sign are directed to don't care. Hide your kids, wives, and husbands because this isn't a pretty place to hang around even during daylight. It's not that you will get harassed, but beware of lice and general stenches.I would say the average wait time is 30-45 minutes depending on what time you get there. There is no waitlist, just a line. I'd say 4 people is good amount for a group--anything more you might waiting longer. Service is superb, by the way.I had this menu item which was so good: Smoked Salmon, Caper, Tomato, Scallion and Natural Cream Cheese ScrambleMy wife has the fried egg sandwich biscuit was also delectable.I've been here twice now and wouldn't be surprised if I'm back here. The only annoying thing is the long wait!

Is it called True Blue because the area that it's in is kind of depressing? One thing about traveling is sometimes you unknowingly wind up wandering into the unsavory parts of the city, but hey, Yelp tells you there's a great breakfast spot around the corner, so keep walking past the homeless, the shifty-eyed, the druggies shooting up in broad daylight, and that famed cornbread and chipotle jelly is all yours for the taking.My bf and I stopped in for lunchtime and got seated, without a wait. We didn't know how much of a big deal this was until our SF friends had told us later on that there's usually a ridiculous line out the door with a matching scroll of a wait list. We definitely scored. Although they're known for their breakfast, we both opted for lunch items to fill up before our bicycle ride to Golden Gate. SMOKED TURKEY SANDWICH for me and ANGUS BURGER WITH CHILI ADDED for him. We had our choice of sides, so we both got the potatoes. Man, everything was good! My sandwich was well crafted with roasted tomatoes, avocado, lettuce and mayo. The bread used was actually a house-made biscuit, which was pleasingly different. My bf enjoyed his burger, but he said that there was too much bread on his. The potatoes came diced and took up the majority of our plates, but we didn't mind since they tasted fantastic -- seasoning and texture on point. Glad we got to experience Dottie's.

Pretty decent brunch spot that's really reasonably priced - MASSIVE portions though so get ready to share! The specials here change every week and they all look fantastic so don't miss out on those. The reason I took off a star is because of the extremely loooong wait times - up to 2 hours over weekends post 10 am. I don't know if this brunch is worth waiting in line for an hour for - maybe one time just to say you did...

Small, hometown feel cafe. I was immediately greeted by a nice gentleman that escorted me to a "bar" seat where you have a front row view to the kitchen. I love watching chefs cook, so this was perfect seating for me :)I ordered orange juice (very good), 1 blueberry cornmeal pancake and a side of potatoes. I'm glad I didn't order more because, man, was that more than enough! The pancake was huge and the "side" of potatoes was more like it's own meal!! I absolutely loved the pancake, crispy around the edges and soft on the inside. The potatoes were decent, too much oregano for me. Also, I think they were drowned in butter! There were so many potatoes and when I was finished it looked like I hadn't even touched the plate Their potatoes must be popular because they had an entire griddle FULL of them, ready to serve! I enjoyed the breakfast and would return for sure....a little pricey, but isn't that the norm for San Fran? :)

I found this place on Yelp and we made our way over to stand in line for 45 mins before my wife and I were seated. The food was plentiful and delicious. The service was quick and attentive upon seating. The restaurant decor and architecture shows the history of the building and restaurant which was cool. The surrounding area of the restaurant provides a view of poverty and those less fortunate which was sad. We ordered off the board of specials rather than the menu: my wife had the sandwich with avocado and I had the stuffed French toast. We also ordered the coffee cake streusel which was more than expected coming out as a mini loaf and cost around $5.50 if I recall. My wife was overwhelmed with food so got a carry out box which she gave to someone in need down the road. Would definitely return.

I've been wanting to try Dottie's for a hot minute, but never wanted to stand in the long line that wraps around the building. We were all meeting for a later breakfast and thought we'd shave off some time by going when we thought everyone was done with their morning meals... it worked, but still stood there for about 45-minutes.The area is not the best and you're probably going to be harassed a variety of homeless people while you're queued. Some are more aggressive than others, so avoiding eye contact for the most part will help deter awkward conversations.Once you're inside, they have specials on a big chalkboard and a beautiful selection of delicious pastries to gawk at while you wait your turn. If you have friends that are chronically late, I'd suggest you don't invite them as they wont seat you until your entire party is there. If you come with one other person, you will definitely get seated faster if you opt for their cramped counter space.For food, I went with the fried egg breakfast sandwich that was on special served on a thick biscuit and loaded with avocado, eggs, cheese, prosciutto and sided with potatoes. There was a whole lot of biscuit and I choose to deconstruct so I could eat the filler ingredients after the first half. I had a few bites of Jaime's spicy frittata with avocado, tomato, jalapeno, corn, scallion and more, and I really enjoyed it.Because it was busy, you had to wait a few before getting refills and or additional condiments. If you have some time to kill and don't mind a long wait to be seated, I'd definitely recommend trying Dottie's at least once while you're in the area! There's a reason why there's a line.

I came here after a friend recommended this is the IT spot in San Francisco for breakfast so I decided to give it a try. As I got to the place, I noticed the line was about a block long, I figured if the line was so big I might as well stay to try it. So about an hour later and being cold, I was able to get a seat. The place itself is very casual, typical diner. It has a few tables as well as hi-top seating. The menu itself is pretty basic, you have your regular breakfasts, combo platter and omelettes and pancakes. They have a specials menu which is more varied and has more creative stuff. I decided to order the prosciutto and avocado egg sandwich with an order of pancakes. The sandwich was very good, was a huge portion and tasted well. The bread was fluffy and the potatoes which came with it were delicious also. The pancakes were great too, no complaints. Price wise, it's a bit pricy but not for San Francisco area. I wouldn't return though, for the simple fact that the wait is that long. I wouldn't wait to get above average breakfast for an hour.

It's cute, the portions are big, the line is long, and the food, despite the hype, is pretty basic. It's a diner that isn't all that greasy in an area that's more than greasy. I think the food is good, coffee was good (though you'll be lucky to get even a single refill) but all things considered it's still a pretty average cleaned up American diner experience. I can't complain about the wait because my friends got there way before I did and waited for what was probably 45 minutes based on when they started texting me. I got stuck on a bus and had to literally run here to make it late but on plus side, I ran 1.4 miles with a few moments getting stuck at some crosswalks in under 15 minutes, making this excursion my fastest mile (and a half) time ever. But I did feel bad because apparently there was a big scary scene with a homeless person that resulted in someone from the restaurant having to come out to protect waiting patrons and patrons huddling together against the exterior of the building for safety. So, pretty classic San Francisco. As soon as my sweaty out-of-breath ass got there we were sat at a nice quiet table in the back and a guy quickly came offering coffee and water but noted we'd have to wait for our server to order. The coffee was great and I'm always a big fan that give you a generous portion of milk and sugar in a container with an easy pour-spout because I like a lot of both and Dottie's fulfilled that for me. We got one of their "famous" pancakes for the table and it was tasty but at the end of the day it was still kind of just a regular old pancaked that was cooked correctly. Not exactly line-worthy. Their regular menu is kinda dull so we all picked stuff off of their specials board. I got the avocado, tomato, jalapeno, corn, scallion, feta frittata with potatoes and toast. I said I didn't want the toast and that was apparently a p big deal. The server legit said it was fine and then came back to me and explained that if I didn't get toast it would be, "my loss"... as if I'd broken up with him and he was raw about it. I just don't like bread. I'm sure it's great but they gave it to me I was just going to waste it. There was def more of a conversation about my decline of the toast than there needed to be but luckily another person at our table swooped in and offered to eat the toast from my plate. Phew. When the food came the portions were hefty and while I thought my plate probably could have had a better presentation, it was good and actually fairly light which is perfect for me since I normally don't eat until after 3pm most days. Two of us had gotten the same dish and neither of us saw or tasted an jalapeno, if that matters to anyone. I definitely think it could have used some more spice than it has sans hot sauce and sans visible or detectable jalapenos. We were able to get out fairly quick so my friend could catch her flight. I'd come back but I wouldn't go out of my way or wait longer than 15 minutes outside the building.

Good old American cooking. Good food and big portions! Make sure to check out the specials board as well- the sweet potato tart was flaky, creamy and lightly sweet; I recommend it with some ketchup (sounds a bit weird, but it's good)I was a bit disappointed because I prefer my potatoes crispy, and we asked if they could prepare them crispy, but they said they couldn't when the kitchen is busy. I get it, but when I go out to eat I want things how I want. Otherwise, would be 5 stars.The only problem with breakfast here, as with most SF brunch places, is that the line is long. It took us an hour to be seated and we arrived around 10:30/11am. You may want to consider going outside peak times.

I'd have to admit, it wasn't looking good in the beginning. Waiting 35 minute it's when there were only two groups ahead of us? I think this place is perfect for a party of 2, you'll be seated REAL quick.So I was already grumpy and a annoyed from the long wait... I had every reason to hate this place until.... I had a bite of there house fries... Everything changed from that moment on... The 35 minute wait was oh so worth that one biteWe got the jalapeno cornbread, the daily special avo prosecutto biscuit sandwhich, and some ginormous egg thing (see picture) and for 3 people it was more than enough. The portions are huge, the quality was amazing, and I was stuffed until the next day hahaI think there has to be a better way to set a party of 3+ more efficiently, but overall great great great food!

Don't let the pictures of the extremely long lines fool you. Yes, this place is very popular, and yes, you may have to wait in a really long line; however, when I showed up with family on a Sunday morning, we managed to beat the line from hell, and instead waited in a line of maybe eight or ten people. Also, be aware that the restaurant doesn't take kindly to people cutting in line. On multiple occasions one of the employees would come out to bring the next person in line inside, and if you're not standing back to back in the line he will think you're cutting. The restaurant is very, very small. They have a few tables, a few spots at the counter, and some outdoor seating. I will also point out that there are in fact two bathrooms. I say this because a few people didn't realize that, and no one should hold it for that long. Our server was nice, despite the fact that he actually poured hot coffee on my hand and not in my mug, and on a different occasion dipped the bottom of said pot into another person's jammed up toast. That being said, he was running around like mad, making sure everyone was happy, and he always apologized when he thought we thought we were being ignored, which we didn't. I ordered the Smoked Whiskey-Fennel Sausage scramble. The scramble has mushrooms and spinach as well, and the whole thing tasted was amazing. The sausage was easily the best part. I have always loved fennel sausage, but this one was by far the best I've ever tasted. The scramble was of decent size, and it was served with chili-cheddar cornbread, and potatoes. The potatoes were fine. They just tasted like regular fried potatoes. The cornbread was sadly a little dry, but good flavor was there. Overall, it's a very decent breakfast spot, and it's very close to BART as well.

I loved this place!!! I just need to say, the pancakes are SOOOO good! I got the raspberry banana pancakes, but the egg sandwich and the sausage scramble were also chosen and all three were delightful. I also want to point out that they took really good care of us. Every time someone walked by they were making sure we didn't need anything. People who weren't our servers, and I actually really loved it. The wait was totally worth it. The food is fresh, we sat at the bar so I got to watch them prepare everything. I would go back and stand in line all over again to try whatever else they have!!! Their Orange juice tasted super fresh (it was fresh squeezed and tasted as such). I honestly cannot say enough about my experience. Great job!!!

Came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 8:45am. There were probably 10 people in line in front of us, and by the time we sat down, it was closer to 9:15. Not an issue, I knew there was going to be a line and was totally prepared for it. What I wasn't prepared for was the service provided by Manny (our server) and the consistency of the food.Le bf and I ordered:1. The Open Road ($16.50) (2 eggs, Italian sausage, home fries, 2 pancakes)2. Smoke Whiskey-Fennel Sausage, Mushroom, Spinach Scramble w/ chili-cheddar corn bread and home fries ($14.50)3. Coffee4. Coffee cakeEven for breakfast in SF, this place is definitely on the higher end, in terms of price, and I can tell you that their price point doesn't match their quality.Le bf and I both really like our breakfast potatoes extra crispy. What we hate most is getting those basically raw potatoes, which is exactly what we got, even though we ordered extra crispy. Manny informed us that the potatoes would be cooked on the flat top and they would give us the crispiest bits. That was a total lie. Our potatoes were basically raw, flavorless, and like any other table's potatoes. When we informed her that the potatoes were flavorless and raw, and nowhere crispy, she basically said that she had already warned us that this was a possibility. Ummm, excuse me, but I've been to plenty of other breakfast places in the city where potatoes are cooked on the flat top and those potatoes came out nice and crispy. Then she left to tend to another table. I guess she realized that her answer wasn't very customer-centric and came back 5 minutes later to ask if we wanted to send it back. At that point, I was pretty not happy, not happy about the potatoes, and extremely pissed at her attitude. I said there was no point in sending it back because clearly I was going to get the same thing. Needless to say, le bf and I both didn't touch our potatoes at all. If you were wondering, she didn't take the potatoes off of our tab. The rest of the breakfast food items were pretty forgettable. I can't recommend the scramble. The pancakes were not consistent in terms of flavor. The pancakes were ginger-y but some bites were more a lot more ginger-y than others, which I thought was weird because all the batter, should theoretically, get mixed together. I sadly don't recommend the regular pancakes eitherOh, and if you wait in line, be prepared to see what Mid-Market has to offer. Only 5 minutes into waiting in line, we saw two homeless people get into a punching match where glasses were stolen/thrown, drinks were thrown, and tons of construction guys with their phones out recording the action. It lasted about 5 minutes The 2 guys were literally rolling on the ground. We will not be coming back. Service was horrible, the food wasn't good and this place just wasn't worth waiting in line for. There are plenty of other breakfast/brunch places that are worth waiting for, like Mymy's, where I don't have to fear for my life while waiting in line.

There are better.The corn bread wasn't that good. The service from our waiter was summed up by his line of: "You ready? If not then I have other tables waiting for me!" Okay sir.... go ahead and take them first...... *awkward pause* Just highly disappointed because I thought it would be better.

I was expecting a lot from the place when I saw how long the line was (waited 35ish mins but got there early), however, I found it to be pretty overrated. The southwestern omelette was good, but really expensive for eggs, veggie and cheese. I also tried the pancakes and wasn't a fan. Service was very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure that coffee and water cups were always filled.

It lives up to the hype with great baked goods and perfectly cooked eggs. Service leaves a bit to be desired but that's on a server to server basis. Overall decent experience. They won't serve your table twice, or add additional items, but it's OK since the portions are very generous. Still, annoying, since people will still keep the tables as long as they want wether they order more or less food. The Hispanic Chef (or whoever he is) was a pissy mess, berating all the other kitchen folk and not cooking anything. The food was definitely good enough so he was probably just on a power trip. As you can see, most of the experience came down to the service.

Great brunch place in San Francisco! I met my best friend for brunch here on Saturday. He got in line 30 minutes before I did and we still had to wait an additional 30 minutes once I got there. The place is pretty small and there's a lot of people who want to get in. I ordered the smoked salmon scramble with cream cheese and it was ridiculously good! Mmmm! Loved the cream cheese part! I would have been disappointed if we had come all the way here and waited if their scrambles were just ordinary but this was unique! My friend got the scramble with prosciutto and that tasted great as well. We upgraded for the chili cheese jalapeno corn bread, it was honestly just okay. It only costs an additional $1 to upgrade to the corn bread, if you order it on it's own it's $4.50 for two pieces. I could have done without the corn bread. I also got an iced mocha along with my meal but it didn't taste good, it was super bitter. All in all I love the scramble! That alone made the trip worth it. The place has a nice urban ambiance to it, service is okay.Be ready to wait a long time!

Update: I woke up with food poisoning after visiting on Sunday afternoon for brunch. I had the Open Road with undercooked potatoes, eggs, crispy bacon, pancakes, and a side of fruit. The food was great but after getting really sick from it, I will not eat here nor recommend it.-------------I tipped my server $20 thats how good the food was. I had the Breakfast Special with scambled eggs, crispy bacon, pancakes, fried potatoes, and a side of fruit. My only complaint was there was too much watermelon in my fruit side but it was still very fresh and yummy. The potatoes were soft and the skin was crunchy, could've been better seasoned though.Get the bacon crispy. You won't regret it.Pancakes were amazing and thick. Couldn't finish eating the two I had. And the eggs were eggs.I was a little skeptical on coming here because of the location (not bad just a lot of homeless people) and the price. The pricing wasn't that bad either considering the portions and location.When I got here, there was a line around the corner. They didn't take down names. A server came outside asking if the was anyone seating 2 or 1, next thing you know I had a table. Service was very quick too.Will NOT be back again.

Dottie's is your typical SF joint that entails an unreasonably long wait and ordinary, average brunch offerings. The reviews surprisingly overhype this place but it's just like any other breakfast/brunch place you could eat at without the 30-45 min wait. For the steep prices, the overall experience misses the mark.I arrived at Dottie's around 9:30 AM and was able to get seated a bit after 10. The line is pretty slow because there's limited seating restricted to mostly tables for two or bar seating. I would say it's appropriate for dates, or if you're with one other person. It's a typical cafe setting and the atmosphere is quite busy. Menu has lots of omelette options and boasts their famous pancakes. I noticed the entrees will run you about $13-15, which was a bit higher than expected based on the quality of the food and how underwhelming the experience was.Service seemed rather scatterbrained, a lot of different waiters came to attend to our tables but weren't super receptive when we were ready to pay and ask for a to-go box. The experience felt a bit overwhelming and it was pretty hard to feel comfortable. The interior of the cafe is unappealing, dark and seems pretty unsanitary (the bathroom needed some maintenance) and it was hard to hold a clear conversation because of the ruckus. Not a great place for a content and satisfying Sunday brunch.Prosciutto Omelette - Basil, Roasted Tomato, Red Pepper Flakes and comes with a heaping portion of home fries and two small chunks of bread (I went with the whole wheat.) Portions were quite large, and I managed to only get through about half of it so I would encourage sharing. Food overall tastes mediocre and really is nothing special. Omelette could've used more sharper and distinct flavors, potatoes were lackluster and the bread was quite dry. My friend got The Open Road which was surprisingly pricy for what it offers. Would expect the french toast to be much larger.Overall the food tastes pretty bland and I would advise people not to even consider waiting here. There's plenty of other good options in the city that would be more worthwhile for the time and money.

Is it worth the 1.5 hour wait? No. I would say it's only worth trying if you can get seated within 30 minutes. Not sure if that's ever possible. Service is terrible. They have the most ridiculous rules about taking only taking your order when it's your turn. Even if you are ready to order before the party that sat down before you they will refuse to take your order first. Which is just plain stupid. Who cares if I sat down before or after them? Whoever is ready to order first should just order. It also took forever for them to bring our check and when we asked someone to look into it they rudely told us to just wait. Coffee cake- was a little dry and wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.Raspberry pancakes- the raspberries made it too mushy. I hate when pancakes are mushy. They weren't fluffy enough. Whiskey fennel sausage scramble- at least the scramble was pretty good, although it's nothing out of the ordinary. Portions were also generous. I liked the side of potatoes that came with it. Cornbread with jalapeno jam- i was really looking forward to this but was disappointed. Maybe i overhyped it for myself. It just wasn't that good. Food is A-okay but service is terrible.

Who knew people actually waited in long lines to eat breakfast? I would never wait this long in LA, but lucky for me my future sister in law went early to hold our spots. And because of her I got to try the amazing famous pancakes here.FOODDottie's Famous Pancakes (5 stars) So so good! A must order!Chocolate Chip Pancake (4 stars): You can't really go wrong with chocolate chip pancakes. Breakfast Sandwich (3.5 stars): Came on a biscuit which is too thick and dry for a sandwich. The biscuit itself was good with jam but not the best choice for a sandwich. Quesadilla (5 stars): Really good quesadilla. Lamb and Goat Cheese Omelet (4 stars)ATMOSPHEREThere was quite a line outside to get seated. If you sit at the counter top you can get in earlier. Once you're inside you forget about all the people outside because it's spacious and much more quiet. SERVICEGreat service. With how busy they are they were always on top of filling water cups.

Dottie's used to be less than a block from my house when I lived in San Fran 9 years ago. When I discovered it, it quickly became my most favorite breakfast place ever. The food was so good, and all the fruit and sides were so fresh.Fast forward to present day and when I still visit SF, I always hit up Dottie's bringing anyone I am with to experience this place. There has always been a line wrapping around the restaurant since I started coming to either location. On my most recent experience with my husband and friend who still resides there, the restaurant was short staffed. The wait as usual was out the door. My only real complaint for the waiting was that many people were in line after us, and because we were 3 people might as well have been at the back of the line. They kept going in, and there we stood hungry and still waiting. At that point, we would've preferred to pull another chair up to a two seater due to the amount of time we were waiting.The cappuccino I ordered wasn't that great. My friend order some kind of blueberry cake that came with fresh whipped cream. It was warmed and sooooooooo good! Two of us had an omelette with the fresh toast that was tasty and strawberry jam on the table. The cook who I remember when I lived here all these years ago is still cokking to this day which I appreciated a lot. I just hope since Dottie's has expanded it doesn't lose what made it so amazing. Everything could've been a bit better, but I will come again when I am in town and hopefully they will be back to a full staff at 100%.

Finally found a weekend where we could commit to waiting an hour-plus in line for breakfast at Dottie's. We arrived at 9am on a Saturday and waited about an hour in line. I wish they sold some of the pastries at the counter because I was pretty hungry while waiting and would have loved a scone or corn bread to nosh on. There is no list, the line is just first come first served. The service at Dottie's once you get inside is superb. It's actually really calm and quiet in the restaurant especially towards the back where we sat. I asked the server what type of coffee they brewed and he said "idk, coffee?" Whatever it is, it was great. We started by ordering the cornbread to start. I had the egg, prosciutto and avocado sandwich on a biscuit and my partner had the big breakfast with pancakes and bacon. There are no ads-ons so make sure to order everything you want at the onset.The cornbread, breakfast sandwich and bacon stood out. The potatoes were super lackluster and my bf said I make better potatoes (Just saying. Gotta have that crispness. These were pale and under-seasoned.) The potatoes at Plow are the standard and these didn't come remotely close.Scrambled eggs were fine. Pancakes were also super disappointing. Very flat and not fluffy at all. My bf gets pancakes most times we have brunch and he was not loving these. Good flavor but terrible texture.Overall, I'm glad I can say I've finally tried the famous Dottie's. It's a bit of a time commitment but food is solid. Good for folks from out of town.

I love, love, love breakfast food and if I could eat it for lunch and dinner I would. Just something about eggs, cheese, potatoes, biscuits always gets to me and I can never turn down a good meal. I came here for the first time on a Friday afternoon and suprisingly, it wasn't that busy. Maybe we missed all the morning rush? I was just glad to get to finally sit. Looked over the menu and pretty much knew what I wanted. The southwestern but instead of tortillas, I asked for cornbread instead. Their cornbread is delicious, it's definitely on the dense end but it has a good kick to it which I love. When the food came out, my eyes literally popped out. The plate was soo huge. The omelette came open faced with meat, veggies, and loads of cheese. I barely made a dent in my plate. My tummy was full and happy.

I came here on a Monday at 11:30AM and there was quite a line. I'd recommend waking through Market street since it's a bit safer! It has vintage and jazzy kind of feel, we felt like we were in New York! The cafe starts off with a bakery and the lady is super nice when you walk in. She'll tell you all the baked goods they have. The board on the top shows their daily or weekly specials (I forgot)Now the food part, if you're carrying a menu with you still - DONT. Leave it at the front or you'll get yelled at like we did... They also offer you coffee when you first sir (I believe it's complimentary)We ordered a smoked salmon... lunch plate (it was the only one on the menu). It was pretty good, it came with large chunk of salmon that was pretty dried up. We requested egg white which was an additional $1. The plate was so large that we shared it with 2 people. They recommended getting the dill as the side bread but it tasted like a garlic bread with no garlic. It looked like scramble eggs with salmon chunks and potato pieces. They were kind enough to split it into two. My other friend ordered the avocado, tomato, jalepeno... special. It was too big for her to finish on her own and if she brought it back home it would've ended up soggy. There were a lot of flavors on the single bite and it looked like an omelette. The portions are pretty large for a restaurant in SF. In the end, we ordered a whiskey rum blueberry cake. This we ended up splitting with 3 people. The lady said this was one the most popular items. We loved it! Don't ask for it as "to go" if you want to take a photo, it comes in an aluminum foil. The crust was AMAZING, you could really taste the whiskey. Overall I think it's a little over hyped. I'd come again for the pastries for sure. It was a little upsetting that they included the To Go order under the same bill (higher tax/tip) and it seemed like they were rushing us out. I guess it was pretty crowded.

This place is alright. The aforementioned wait can be a while and it isn't in the prettiest of sf neighborhoods. On a Friday morning at 10:30am the wait was 30 minutes. According to the ladies in front of us the wait was not bad at all. Shocking to me considering the time and day. Once in, the restaurant is small. The majority of seats are for 2 people, anything more can be a pain. Service is ok. Slower than normal but the staff seems to run with the heads cut off, so I understand. They really do try. Food, well, I found mine decent. I got the salmon scramble, my buddy, some Mexican style scramble with sausage and tortillas, I forget the name. My buddy loved his choice, I was neither in love nor did i hate my meal. It was solid yet not that satifying. Their dill bread was very good and the best thing that I ate. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Dottie's. It was good yet not the best brunch place I've ever been to.

1.5 hour wait on a Monday morning for just an average breakfast. The service throws you off. It is one of those places that treats you as if you should be thankful that you are getting a table. They have their rules like ordering everything you want at once, which has never happened at a breakfast spot even at ones where I have also waited this long.Anyways the small things would be meaningless to me if their food lived up to the wait and the hype, but it failed to. Their bakery portion of their options does some work. I ordered a loaf of their special baked bread that did well with me. Their pancakes on the other hand, had nothing special to the omelet was an omelet. Home fries were average, salsa was flavorless.Breakfast is simple to rate, and Dottie's has nothing special to offer. I would not mind running into Dottie's if it was next to my hotel and without a line, but waiting more than 30 minutes is more than you should for a breakfast as average as the one I had.

This place is amazing! It's hard to find a breakfast place you can crave. I had one of there specials that had my friends drooling for it was so big the 3 of them got a good bite it too! Lol. The only downfall is that the severs here seem a bit overworked. We came on a Saturday and it was a long wait, lots of people and our server was moody which I completely understand.. but they need more help on weekends. & bigger seating for large groups. Will still be back.. hopefully on a not so busy morning.

Wanted to try some brunch places in SF and yelp took me here. I arrived around 11:30am on a weekend and was met by a line extending to the side of the building/into the alley. Alley was pretty sketchy and wait time came to be about 40 minutes. Once seated, my friend and I ordered the oatmeal with dried figs and the pulled pork, roasted onion and jack cheese scramble. I also substituted the toast for corn bread with jalepeno jelly. No wonder this place had such high rating! Brunch was filling and left my stomach happy. Would highly recommend!! I would probably come back again to try one of their specials next time.

If you don't mind the wait, come on down. Fair warning, there are a lot of homeless around and the urine stench is just... you know. It was funny when a hobo came over to tell the people to line up by the side of the restaurant, not along the meters. He knows what he's talkin' about in his turf.Superbowl sunday, the wait was about 30 minutes at 9. They don't have a sign up sheet so you are expected to stand there, with your whole party, to be seated. Dotties is a really small place. But if you didn't want to eat there, you may go up to the counter and place an order. There's also a huge specials at the front.I got the Pulled Pork, Roasted Onion and Jack Cheese Scramble. $12.25. I have to say, it was a huge portion. I honestly couldnt even finish half. There was a lot of cheese too so I think that filled me up pretty quick. Egg to meat ratio was perfect. The home fries were standard. I subbed the tortilla for toast, free of charge. The toast reminded me of those biscuits from KFC. Tried the pepper jelly. Not too bad. It's basically spicy jam so...Wait was 30 mins, order/waiting for food/eating/paying took about 1hr for my party of 5. I think that's a pretty good time.

Yes, the line sucks, but it moves fairly quickly. We arrived just before noon on a Sunday and waited about 30 minutes. We also agreed to sit at the bar, which cut down some of the waiting time.My better half and I shared the Pecan roll and it was delicious. Just the right size for 2 people to share and not totally kill your appetite for the main course. I had the Smoked Whiskey-Fennel Sausage scramble with mushroom and spinach. I was a bit hesitant to order this because it didn't come with cheese, but after eating a couple bites, I didn't notice the lack of cheese at all. The mixture of the meat and veggies to go with the chili-cheddar cornbread was plenty good. It was so filling, I couldn't quite finish it. My gf was equally happy with her Pulled Pork scramble. Normally, I rarely go to a restaurant with a long line, but in this case, the food was worth the wait.

Had a 3 egg fennel sausage omelette. If was large, flavorful and I was full for 6 hours. Not the plan. I'm still not use to American size portions & didn't expect a omelet to be so large. So I think they either have to reduce the portion size or have a smaller size option (& have a lower price accordingly). Tasty but I can't come back.

Lines are super long and you just kinda line up and wait, you don't put your name down like at other restaurants. We had to share our table with another party because it was that crowded. It was pretty smushed for 4 people. I got the hot links with poached eggs and potatoes and the cornbread with jalapeno jam. The hot links were good, the eggs weren't runny enough, the potatoes were whatever, and after reading all the hype about the cornbread with the jalapeno jam, it did not live up to my expectations. Semi-decent plate of food, but not worth the wait and price.

Yikes! We waited 45+ minutes for two on a Saturday morning. It really did not help that it was 50 something degrees and there was a wind blowing this particular morning. I hate the fact that this cafe does not have a "check in" of any sort. You just have to go to the back of the line and start waiting which is really inconvenient to be honest. Not to mention, the servers don't turn the tables as fast as they should. While we were waiting, we saw A LOT of tables just waiting to be cleared and the servers just casually walking by them without doing anything. It was incredibly annoying and really quite inefficient. When we finally did get a table though the service was pretty good. They took our orders relatively quickly and our food came out in a timely manner so that was good. We ordered the Smoked Whiskey Fennel Sausage Scramble (also comes with mushrooms, baby spinach), the Luisiana Sausage with Eggs and one pancake to share between us. Both dishes come with grilled chili cheddar corn bread and home fries. The Whiskey Sausage Scramble was really good but it didn't taste like anything I couldn't make at home. Same thing with the Luisiana Sausage. It was literally just a grilled sausage with some eggs and potatoes. The pancake? Very average. Basically nothing stood out. I appreciated that the potatoes tasted fresh though! The best part of our meal was definitely the grilled corn bread. That was something different and quite tasty and I enjoyed that with our coffee and unsweetened chai latte. Overall, the food was very overpriced for something that was so mediocre. I genuinely don't understand the hype and I would never wait more than 20 minutes for this cafe when there's probably another cafe that serves the same food just around the corner. Worth a visit just to say you've been there once! 3/5

"The reason you see hipsters lined up in the Tenderloin"It's 9 am on a Sunday. On your morning stroll through the neighborhood to clean up used needles and old pipes, you come across a line stretched around the block. "That's strange, I don't remember a food bank around here", you tell yourself. You lean in for a closer inspection and notice that these aren't unshaven people in hand me down clothes. No. Their beards have been freshly manicured at People's Barbershop and their heads are covered in Neff beanies straight off of Amazon. You've discovered a hipster hotspot....Once you get in (keep reading for a PROTIP at the end), you'll notice the atmosphere is pretty chill. Nothing loud like pink elephant, just warm and quaint.This place is mainly known for the food (are there even drinks here? It's a brunch spot). The food is awesome though. And the portions are hearty. I've tried a lot of it and you really can't go wrong, but my favorites are the egg/omelet dishes with the tortillas. Pulled pork one is bomb.I'm a dessert guy and these are all freshly made. Giant portions. Some of them have alcohol in them. Coconut rum cinnamon bun is the real MVP.Only downside is this place can get pricey once you start stacking on sides and a dessert. The full French toast orders don't come with sides, and they often tempt you with their [INSERT RANDOM FRUIT HERE] specials. If you get a full order of French toast and a side you can be looking at $35-$40. Just get the half order that includes sides and it'll be closer to $25 out the door.PROTIP: "How to defeat the line."Step 1: Go out Friday or Saturday nightStep 2: Get about 4-5 mixed drinks and follow up with 2-3 shotsStep 3: If the bar/club is closing then get some tacos. If not, repeat Step 2.Step 4: PTFOStep 5: Hobble over to DottiesStep 6: If your phone says it's 1:30 or later, you've done steps 1-3 correctly. If not, go to CVS and get a pedialite while you wait.Step 7: Profit! There should be no more line

By very good fortune I found myself in San Francisco and happily return to Dottie's. First discovered this place in January 2013 when I was in town for the Fancy Food Show. That trip I was able to go here twice would have gone more but they do close for a well deserved day off. So the Uber driver takes us from our hotel and says how do you know about Dottie's like it's a secret that he was sorry to share. Upon arriving on a Sunday morning it already was open and we were 2nd in line. Than shortly after the line continues to grow and wraps around the building. This place is the best breakfast spot in the world. Anything you order will be prepared to perfection. Luckily since we were a party of 2 we got past the party if 4 ahead of us. The restaurant is located in a very old and historic building. It is decorated perfectly and is so welcoming you don't want to leave. The waiter was very attentive and got us our beverages as we decided on what to order. I had the black bean cakes with 2 eggs sunny side up corn bread and jalapeno jelly 50 cents extra. It was sheer heaven. Just wished I could have ate every wonderful morsel. My husband had the chorizo sausage omelette. Please consider opening a location in South Florida. See you next time we are in San Fran.

Located on the sketchy 6th street (but right near Market street), Dottie's always has a long line that wraps around the corner around brunch times - esp on the weekends. Their menu always sounds super cool and different - each plate tends to have a twist from the normal brunch places that youd see. Like a bleu cheese scramble, or heavily smoked bison sausage, etc. It's all really good, but you might want to share plates because it is heavy, has huge servings, and after a few bites you tend to want something different. But trust me, the first few bites are heavenly. Their dessert selection is also mouthwatering just by reading it.The service is 10/10. Interior deco also is homey and vintagey - just right for SF feels.

After hearing about all the hype, I went to Dottie's on a rainy Saturday morning around 11AM. I thought because it was raining, the wait will be less? Noo, apparently everyone thought that and the wait ended up to be around 1-1.5hrs. But hey, the hype was real and the food is pretty good! The highlights ~- Caramel streusel coffee cake: Omg, hands down this is the best coffee cake I ever had! It's what the waitress recommended and omg it does not disappoint! It's a tad little pricey, but I would gladly pay to get it again! The crumbs is crunchy, it's not excessively sweet, perfect balance of the shortening on top, so yummy! - Smoked Whiskey-Fennel Sausage, Mushroom, and Baby Spinach Scramble. The potatoes were light, and and the cornbread was spicy and crunchy (omg the red pepper jelly!). The scramble was amazing ~ eggs cooked perfectly and omg the sausage taste so good. The portion is ridiculous. I had enough leftovers for dinner the night of and also for next morning's breakfast. Highly recommended!The overall ambience is kinda cute. From the pastries and coffee mugs to the chalk signs and wooden tables. Our server was amazing! Patiently explaining the menu and giving her recommendations. Can't wait to come back!

We came here waited about an hour because the reviews were great. I ordered the French toast I took one bite and it wasn't good just tasted like cake. I told my waiter I didn't like it and to send it back and he says to me "then why did you order it" wait what?? Then I said I do not want it for him to send it back and he said I can't do that it's a waste and walks away from me. I assumed he would at least remove it from the bill but no they STILL charged me for it!! I asked for the manager and he said the manager is busy right now he can't talk to you. Then some lady comes to me and says what do you want I said I'm not paying for this I didn't eat it and she says to me you took a bite. Why didn't you tell us you don't like it in the beginning. Now I'm a liar apparently?? RUDE SERVICE RUDE MANAGER they refused to remove it from the bill! Manager was in the back yelling I don't have time for them! Horrible!!

Hair in the food. Terrible service. Terrible food. Broken glass for my Mocha which hurt my girlfriends hand. And the owner/chef is definitely very rude and unpleasant as he couldn't even accept the hair in the food as he just looked away. Please note the chef is not wearing gloves, wiping his hands all over and cooking food in the bulk.It wasn't worth the wait in line, which exists primarily because of the lack of seating space inside not at the virtue of the place. I WOULD NOT recommend this place. Much nicer places in the city

Came here for Father's Day Sunday brunch, and although we had to wait in line for about 45 minutes, it was TOTALLY WORTH IT! (Most good places in the city have a wait anyways)To clarify, I asked if their menu offered anything vegan. To my surprise, they offer a vegan hash that's off the menu! I would totally wait in that long line again and again for this meal. It was a delicious dish with potatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers, corn, tomato, etc. and served with their homemade wheat toast, avocado and hummus!! I can't even describe how yummy it was. (I also ordered a side bowl of fruit... I didn't know how huge the hash would be!)My parents shared the Southwestern omelet, and although they loved it, they kept eating off of my plate (they preferred my hash over their side potatoes). MUST COME HERE & ORDER THE VEGAN HASH!!

This place is Awesome! So I wasn't familiar with a good breakfast spot in SF and decided to trust the yelp reviews on this place, it didn't let me down! The outside does look a little sketchy and i was a little hesitant to go inside but I'm glad I did! I walked in and was greeted instantly by a host who asked if I could wait 5min or take a seat at the community table, I decided to wait and it wasn't more than 3minutes before I was seated. It's a very inviting restaurant from the ambiance to the entire wait staff. I ordered the wild boar sausage, eggs, potatoes and French toast! The portions were great, not over bearing but enough to have a little left over. Overall exactly what I was looking for!

I came here with my boyfriend on Saturday around 10AM and as people have noted, there was a line around the corner. We ended up waiting around 35 min and also because we were only 2 people, we cut a couple of groups ahead of us. The vibe is very rustic and original. The kitchen is exposed and right in the middle of the restaurant and so, the whole cafe is pretty small. We chose to sit at the bar in front of the kitchen space so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. The food was definitely worth it. I got the lamb sausage omelette and it was amazing. I can't even describe how the flavors just all came together and even just a simple omelette tasted so good! My boyfriend got the smoked salmon scramble and the smoked salmon was so heavenly! The highlight was definitely the homemade toast on the side. The bread was so fresh and thick. I wish I could get a loaf of it! Overall, it was a nice brunch experience. I probably won't be here too often since it's in downtown SF and not in the most safest part, but definitely amazing food!

The "Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach And Goat Cheese Omelette" was as much of a (yummy) mouthful as it is to say. It's super delicious and uses a satisfying ratio of quality ingredients; that is, they definitely didn't skimp on the goat cheese or lamb sausage. Would definitely order again. I opted for the side of fruit (blackberries, strawberries, melon--all nice and fresh) and the buttermilk toast, which was so hearty! I didn't see any need to put butter or jam on it -- the texture is coarse and the crust is thick, so the experience of eating it plain was amazing by itself. I'm bumping this review down to 4 stars because waiting for an hour outside near the Tenderloin was not fun. I'm also a sucker for novel flavors, so while the notes in this omelette pair very well, these flavors bring nothing new to the palate table.

The line here isn't because the food is exceptional, it's because the kitchen is understaffed and unable to accommodate. My co-worker and I waited in line for about 15mins and then were at the beginning at the line, so not bad! Except once we were next in line, the host said they were holding seating people because the chef had too many orders and didn't want to take any more until they caught up. Understandable, but they were so rude about it. Meanwhile, a line of at least 30ppl built up behind us. The whole dining area was pretty empty too. We ended up leaving and going to another place since we had a flight to catch, of course after being suckered waiting for an hour. The rest of the wait staff wouldn't even make eye contact with us since they knew we were all waiting and seeing open tables everywhere.

Like many other places in San Francisco, this place is best for breakfast. They have a huge and amazing menu, along with a long list of specials. There breakfast food is super unique, with a few vegetarian options. I got the black bean cakes, something i normally wouldn't go for, but they were amazing and a fun twist on a breakfast meal. The atmosphere of this place is super cute and quaint. You're going to have to wait a while though, my family and I played Head's Up on my sister's phone to pass the time. Area is not so great, lots of homeless people and kinda smells like pee, but the cafe itself is great. Definitely would go again!

Arrived at 930am on a Saturday morning and only had to wait 30 minutes, not bad at all.We were seated in the far back, which had a much quieter atmosphere. I ordered the whiskey fennel sausage, mushroom, spinach scramble, which came with corn bread, home fries. I also added on the extra jalapeno jam sauce, which paired well with the corn bread. The scramble wasn't too salty and tasted quite healthy especially cause there wasn't much oil. I tried my friend's southwestern omelette, which was a bit too cheesy/heavy for my liking, but the flavor with the salsa was excellent.We finished off the meal with the whiskey blueberry crumble cake. This pastry is fricking enormous! I expected a slice of cake, not an entire loaf of bread. The crust of the crumble paired with the cold vanilla cream was the best part of the cake. The center tasted bland and could have used more blueberries. The cream helped make the middle taste more moist.Service here was satisfactory, not too fast or too slow.

My #1 favorite American breakfast place of all time! But the key is that you really should get there by opening or shortly thereafter... I've gone with late-rising friends and waited an hour and a half before! My favorite thing is their daily changing menu, an entire board of savory specials and an entire board of sweets. But if you don't like fancy pants whisky fennel sausage or cornbread with jalapeno jelly, their old standbys like their pancakes and oatmeal are top notch as well.

Charlotte. If you see a blonde short haired waitress upon sitting down, immediately ask for someone else. She took 15 minutes to come to our table and take our order. She got my order wrong and didn't take responsibility. She also suggested that I go talk to the person at the bakery to clarify the mistake. I do not work there? She said she would make it right, she never came back to give me an update. Not once did she check up on us without me having to call her attention. Dotties is a busy place but we went during the last hour and it was not busy at all. The table next to us had the same experience. I hate to write a negative review. Hope everyone else's experience is better than mine :(

Early in the morning, my coworker and I ended up wandering around SOMA and Tenderloin looking for breakfast, and decided to check this place out because of the line that was beginning to queue up before they even opened, and the reviews of the place were fantastic.Everything here (aside from the orange juice) is made from scratch using their own recipes. That aside though, we found the food to be average breakfast food. I got the Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach And Goat Cheese Omelet which was a good omelette, but is a mouthful to say. It probably had too many things going into it though. We also had a fresh baked muffin which was huge enough to share between two grown men (though we did get our own breakfast plates) and was probably the best part of breakfast. I also had a side of the extra thick buttermilk dill toast which tasted great with their home made jam...but without it, was decidedly plain. My coworker got the house special pancakes at the recommendation of the waitress, but he thought they were mediocre.Food aside, the venue is pretty nice and has a great atmosphere. The service was also great, and the staff very knowledgeable.

Great spot for brunch. Much more than your average eggs and something. The sausages are superb and highly recommended. Bit of a line to get in but it moves along soon enough. Good service and not too expensive. If you are looking for bite to eat that will set you up for the day and have some time then well worth checking out.

This place was recommended by a friend. The line was to the corner of the block so it must be worth it! The line went fairly fast, and our party of 2 was seated fairly fast as well at the bar. I got the fried egg sandwich special and coffee to wash it down. Service was friendly and efficient.

We arrived at 12:30pm on a Friday and waited for 40 minutes to get seated. Not bad for SF brunch, although I'd predict significantly longer wait times on weekends. Do keep in mind that Dottie's is located in the Tenderloin and that the queues often extend past around the corner. Also, try not to go with a big party, since they have few tables that seat over 4 people.ENTREES// Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet ($16.95) - 5 starsThe goat cheese has a sharp contrast with the gamey flavor of the lamb sausage. Very unique!// Smoked Whiskey-Fennel Sausage, Mushroom and Baby Spinach Scramble ($14.50) - 5 starsEven if this omelet comes with only 3 ingredients compared to the one above's 5, I enjoyed it just as much.// Blueberry Cornmeal Pancakes ($15.50) - 3 starsComes with 3 pancakes. Mom and I were expecting more, but my brother absolutely loved them. He's been all about the maize these days.SIDES// Buttermilk Dill Toast - 4 starsThe crust was crispy and the insides were chewy. Yum!// Grilled Cornbread w/ Jalapeno Jelly - 3 starsWay overhyped! The cornbread itself was dry and brittle, although the jelly does enhance the flavor and consistency.ProTip: While you are still lining up, remember to take a picture of both the bakery and the daily specials menu. You'll have to step out again to the front of the restaurant otherwise.

A 45 minute line leads you to a big room with sparse seating. They have the room and could certainly cram in extra tables. The line outside is a lure for this place... the spectacle adds mystique. Once inside the place is quiet like a church with a low mumble of diners, clanking silverware and the pans rustling in the open kitchen... The absence of any music gives the place a sterile, bus station feel.The baked goods are a highlight.. The whiskey blueberry pound cake was the size of a birthday cake and delicious..Breakfast items are prepared well, with a attention to detail, not sloppily slapped together... But folks, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... It's just breakfast. There are no unicorns or fairy dust here... It's sadly eggs and pretty good coffee.

Best breakfast I've had in a long time. The line out the door was a good sign this place was worth a visit and the wait is worth it! I had the spicy hot link and pesto scramble, I couldn't stop telling people about how amazing it was! Next time you're in the city, make sure to stop by.

I went there by myself for breakfast. There was a line put the door of folks waiting. I have no idea how long the wait typically is, but there was also a line when I left, so this is a popular place! I was able to jump the line since I was by myself and invited to sit at the bar.The food I ordered was delicious! I got the black bean cakes ~ it was a LOT of food! The wait staff was SO welcoming and attentive and didn't rush me to finish, despite the continual line.I had a phenomenal experience and would absolutely return!
