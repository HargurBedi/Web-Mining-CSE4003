Stumbled (literally) upon this place with a group of my friends a few years ago when we were buzzed and just wanted to eat something. Located on the 2nd level of Pier 29, I recall there was a pretty long wait (everywhere in SF had a wait) so we did what we always do to kill time - have more drinks at the bar. In my drunken state, I remember thinking to myself it was one of the best meals I've ever had. My friends all agreed which I felt validated my intoxicated opinion, no? Anyway since then I've been itching to come back to see if sober me feels the same. Few years later, I finally came back to take my little cousin out for her birthday. Sober verdict? Just as I remembered; very few things fell short of perfection. We came on a Monday afternoon and still had to wait 45 minutes! Since my cousin is only 15 and we couldn't just go have a drink at the bar, I tried to find some family-friendly things to do nearby and luckily we walked right into Mirror Maze which was such a fun way to kill time. This time we got the: Whole Crab + Double shrimp - Served on a sizzling skillet, roasted with their garlic sauce. Just like how I remembered it! Ahhmazing! Make sure you dip the bread in the sauce on the skillet. It comes with a garlic butter sauce and a herb butter sauce but I prefer the sauce on the skillet. Seafood Cioppino - Didn't care for this dish; not a tomato broth person but my cousin said she really liked it.Garlic noodles with added crab - You MUST get this dish - I repeat - you MUST get it this dish. It's the key dish that gives the meal that perfect carb-to-crab balance. Definitely on my top 5 list of favorite garlic noodles and, like I've mentioned before, I'm a garlic noodles CONNOISSEUR! Tiramisu - I'm not a dessert person by any means, unless it's ice cream, but this was so addicting. We demolished it. The only downside is that they clean out the crab guts before hand so even if you order the whole crab you can't get the guts :( My favorite part of the crab!!!

I would probably agree with the average reviews that this is 3.5 stars.The garlic fries were meh. Crab cakes were basically $9 each, that order is only 2 crab cakes and I split that between 4 people.The crab chowder was also mediocre.My favorite was the hot skillet seafood (mussels and shrimp) but even that was kind of on the pricey side. The price just didn't feel justified for the quality of the food.

My friend and I dined here on the recommendation of a local when we were in town- I'm now thinking he may get a cut of all the proceeds just for sending people their way. We got here too late at night for the fantastic views we heard of, so definitely go during sunlight hours if you want that.We were quoted a 45 min-1 hour wait time, and stared at for a while as we decided what else was around, when the hostess then offered us immediate seating at the "communal" fire pit table. Um, heck yes! Some view that as the peasants table but we viewed it as an immediate service and maybe some new friends. It took a bit to get the waiter to come to us but after that, we had great service the whole meal- so if you're in the same boat as we were, go the communal table route.The food was your typical upscale tourist dining experience- yummy food but the price tag to go with it. I think we ended up making some free bread and an appetizer each our meals. Better option than most of the establishments on Pier 39

OK, shoot me for thinking 4 pieces of cheesy garlic bread should cost me anything $5 and under. Forgive me for thinking that even Red Lobster's shrimp Alfredo tastes better than the one here. It was begging for seasoning.And lastly, forgive me for not ordering crab at a crab place simply because I didn't feel like going to town on a whole crab. I was instantly regretful when I saw the sizzling crabs and the inhaled the garlic and everything else. Ugh.Since the shrimp alfredo was an epic fail, we also ordered a bowl of crab chowder. Very celery-y but we still enjoyed it.Cheese bread was heavenly but it was severely overpriced for 4 measly pieces.Beautiful view and can't wait to come back with Scott when I get a pretty penny and an appetite for crab.

Well one thing for certain.. They get you in & out!! lol came to check out the Crab House because i always seen it walking Pier 39 but never stopped because it seemed so busy.. glad i stopped! The food was GOOD!! We ordered a whole Dungeoness crab & Crab Alfredo.. the crab alfredo was SUPER GOOD!! I already know im ordering that next time lol the crab was OK not much flavor and was drinched in butter. It would have been amazing if the butter had flavor! But our meals came out extremely fast, i thought they might have had the wrong table! Waited about 30 minutes to be seated.. but once seated they came & took our order immediately & we had our food in less than 15mins! It was SUPER small in there though! Jam packed!

This was our first stop when we arrived in SF...well our first stop after we checked in our hotel lol. We made reservations and were seated by the window. We ordered the garlic roasted crab which was large enough to share with garlic fries. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. We felt the crab we shared was a reasonable price for a touristy spot. We enjoyed our dinner overall and left satisfied.

The name of the restaurant and the decor attracted me to the restaurant. When we arrived inside, it was so cool that restaurant got the pier as a view. There are crabs in all sorts of disguise (bride, pirate, ghost...) around the whole restaurant as a decor. The service was friendly and super quick.The food was delicious. My sister steak was so good and perfectly cooked. She was one satisfied girl. I ate shrimp and mussels with lemon butter sauce. It was so tasty that I felt I was in heaven. When you pass by the fisherman's wharf... come by this restaurant. It is worth it...even though, it's pricey.

Service wasn't as friendly, or I would have given it a five stars. The bus help was around more than the actual server. On our way out, our server didn't acknowledge us. Having been trained in the hospitality industry, I would always acknowledge customers. The view was amazing. It was the perfect spot to catch San Francisco's sunset and some grub. The food was awesome. I had the full crab and double shrimp on a hot top. My dish came with two dipping sauces, one extra buttery and the other citrusy. Pricing wasn't too bad. On my own, I spent a little over $50. Overall, the food was great but the service wasn't 5 stars worth. I admire small restaurants like this one, but I expected a lot more pride and effort among the servers. Nonetheless, the food was great, so 4 stars.

Only giving this place 4 stars b/c it didn't feel so clean and tables were kind of dirty. Other than that, I enjoyed the food very much! We ordered the "lotsa crab" which was 3 lbs to share for two and the "Iron Skillet Roasted" shrimp and mussels. It was a good portion for two. I could have eaten more but it gets pricey. Can't say that I could go back because we are from RI. But if we lived in San Fran or if there were a Crab House near me...we would be regulars for sure!

Location, perfect! Garlic noodle pasta with crab, delish! Crab, delish! Mojito, delish! I wasn't a fan of the crab chowder or the cleanliness of the restaurant. We sat in a booth and not that it was filthy but in the corner of the booth there was alot of crumbs, trash, dirty walls that just need to be wiped down and only I would probably notice. Pricey but that was expected; seafood, Pier 39. Server was friendly and knowledgeable regarding portion sizes and recommendations on the different seafood platters/crab plates.

I went here twice - once last November, and once this past week. The first time was great. We were there with a group of about 12, and were treated nicely. Monday I sat at the bar with my friend and the service was a little less than stellar. The beers we ordered(Great White?) were skunked and not very good. The food was decent - I had a plate of calamari I'd order again, but I ordered garlic fries which never showed up even after two reminders that I was in a hurry to catch a flight back to NYC.I'd come back, but maybe table service next time.

In my opinion Crab House wasn't that good or anything special. My husband and I came here because it was suggested by a local. Well this wasn't our favorite place to dine while visiting. We started our lunch with a side salad and their bread bowl of Clam Chowder. The salad was ok. Nothing special. The tomatoes seemed like stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. It was different but I care for fresh tomatoes instead. It was romaine lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cheese, and dressing. The dressing wasn't that good or didn't taste homemade. It tasted like standard bottled dressing. My husband's soup was ok to me but he felt it tasted more like a vegetable soup or stew. It had a lot of vegetables in it. He felt like the Fog House's Chowder was better. In my opinion I liked Crab House Chowder better. I will say the Fog House chowder is more like a real Chowder. I ordered the Crab Angel Hair Lasagna and my husband ordered the Crab Alfredo for our main meals. I love angel hair pasta so this was fitting for me. The sauce that was served with the dish was salty and super buttery. Besides the Salt it was ok. The actual lasagna itself wasn't bad. It could have used a tad more seasoning but it was ok. My husband thought his Alfredo was pretty good. I will say the Alfredo sauce was actually decent and his noodles were cooked well. Both of our dishes were good but nothing spectacular.Overall, the Crab House wasn't horrible but there are certainly other places to get better food.

Love this place! Great spot on Pier 39. Not too long of a wait, but I called ahead of time to check their wait times. Our wait was 15 min. One piece of advice is that the garlic noodles are better without the crab. It's $8 more & loses its garlic taste. Personally the views are better during lunchtime rather than dinner, but I still like the ambiance!2017.08.24 Thursday for 2 people.

This has been the best experience I've had with seafood thus far. We ordered the crab and the skillet shrimp and mussels. The butter sauce that came with the shrimp is to die for; so much flavor. The crab was magnificent as well. There were a couple pieces that weren't so fresh, but the waiter was super kind about giving us a couple more pieces. Service was quick as well, and our waiter was really attentive. Will definitely return for more!

I love crab! First time trying this restaurant out and it was average price for seafood! We ordered the lotsa crab and it was just the right order for my boyfriend and I. We were so full after eating.. it was so good. They also had lemon butter and garlic butter for dipping sauce. Not that long of a wait, surprisingly. They had other combo's on their menu as well. Lots of variety, crab and shrimp combos or family combos as well! Must try if you're in the area!

My husband really wanted to come back to eat here since it was my first time in San Francisco. We ended up going here since it was conveniently right by where we did a segway tour right on Pier 39.We walked in to a crowd and talked to the hostess. We decided to go for the bar area since it was just the two of us and less of a wait. After a short wait for them to clean up, we got seated immediately. I had a good look at the menu before so we put in our order immediately.We got an order of the lotsa crab to share as well as our own set of drinks. I got the Moscow Mule and the husband got a bear on draft. The drinks came out first and they do not skimp out on portions. My Moscow Mule was served in a high glass which is far more generous than the copper mugs you usually get it in. Next, our waiter offered us some bibs to enjoy crab without so much mess. I was wearing a white sweater so I happily took the bib.Out comes the crab! It came out freshly cooked with tons of garlic on top. This was my first time having Dungeness Crab and I think I had expectations similar to Snow Crabs. The crab itself is easy to break apart just by hand, but the crab meat just tasted dry to me. I dipped the meat into the sauce, but the meat still tasted dry to me. Husband was super happy eating it and for once ate more crab than me.Service of the place was pretty impressive. They know how to turn tables quite fast and clean. As soon as we were done with a plate, it was cleared. Thankfully so, because the bar area we sat at could be so cramped with everyone ordering crab.Overall, I'm just not crazy about the crab, but it's definitely a west coast experience to try out, regardless.

BEWARE! They have changed their style in the past two month. My husband and I visited this place several times in the past 4 years. Each time we order the combo of shrimp, mussel and crab was fresh and juicy. However, when we brought our friends who flew from another state to visit us to this place today, we were totally shocked! They started to serve refrigerate cold French bread which is extremely hard and stiff to chew. And they refused to warm it because our servant believes it is what it is. Think about it, how would a good restaurant service rejects their customers' request!!!!! Worse thing is that the combo we used to order is not fresh any more. The crab meat is dried out which means it's been there for a while and the mussel shrink a lot to tiny finger tip compare to their shell size. They are dry and not juicy at all. Considering eating unfresh sea food is pretty dangerous to our health, this will be our last time to go to this place. I would also warn anyone else to go there. Because getting dysentery by eating unfresh sea food is not worth it.

Stumbled across this place while looking for dinner in the area. We took a road trip up from San Diego that day for spring break and hubby's work, so we were tired and it was getting late! Luckily, Bubba Gump's had an hour and a half wait, otherwise we would have never found this place!The Crabhouse is located right on Pier 39 with amazing views of the city and the bay. We arrived on a Saturday night so we assumed we would never get a seat. Luckily, we only had to wait about 30 minutes before they seated our party of 6 on two separate tables close to each other. The inside was pretty loud and crowded, but we didn't care - we were hungry!The hubby and I shared their $50 seafood plate which arrived on a HUGE sizzling griddle. Perfect for two and maybe even 3 or 4 people! There was mussels, shrimp and dungeness crab seasoned to perfection with a butter chimichurri sauce on the side. I was hoping there would be a side to accompany it; like rice or potatoes, but our server informed us that it did not come with any, but that he would bring out some bread. The kids ordered the crab chowder, the salmon plate and a burger. They each said their food was delicious! Tried the chowder, which was served in a bread bowl and thought it was very creamy and tasty!Our server was very friendly and gave us just the right amount of space to enjoy our food. The prices were on the steep end and we noticed that the customers around us were either on dates or celebrating an occasion. Anyways, it was a pretty great meal to start out our vacation in San Francisco. So glad we decided to try this place out. We enjoyed this restaurant and highly recommend it. Can't wait to go back!

Absolutely Fabulous! On my last night in California me and my best friend tried out this restaurant. The food was incredible and the customer service was superb. The next time I come back to California I will be revising this place again. The seafood was fresh and delicious. The restaurant is right off the water so the weather was extremely cold, but inside the restaurant was so warm. When arriving at the establishment can take a longtime if you don't have reservations. The food is a bit on the high end but it was all worth it

Made reservation for Sunday at 6:30 for me and my boyfriend. There was a line and the restaurant was extremely busy. We came a half hour early. The hostess said it was fine and sat us in a booth. No wait! Our server, her name is Mam, came over immediately and got us started on drinks. My boyfriend got a beer and I ordered their strawberry mohito which I didn't expect to be so delicious. Just the right amount of liquor in it and not too sweet. I ordered the 2 lb crabs. The butter and garlic sauce that the crab was cooked it made the crab taste so so so good. Mam, our server is so friendly and fast. She cut up my crabs and also took photos of us. Love her. I ate the entire crab , I did not share. It tasted like heaven...when you dip the crabmeat in the butter garlic sauce and it enters your mouth. I couldn't get over how delicious it was. I honestly could of ate another one by myself. Thanks Crab House and Mam.

I've lived in the Bay Area for 10 years and have gone to the pier 39 countless of times but have never ate there. My friend suggested we go to crab house. We went right after the blue angels show, expecting the wait to be long, we only waited 10 minutes. It's right along the water so the view is wonderful. The service was very good, they are quick to what you need. After we ordered the food came in 3 minutes! I have never received my food that quick before. I ordered shrimp with garlic fries. The garlic fries were a little too greasy, but the fried shrimp were delicious. The shrimp cocktail sauce was the best I've ever had. My friend had the crab, I had a little bit and it was cooked to perfection. The water glasses were a little to small for how greasy my food was. I would've preferred a bigger glass or continuos water fills. Other than that, the food and view were great!

We stumbled upon the Crab House in the very busy tourist saturated Pier 39. We had limited time until we had to catch the nearby ferry and everything in the immediate area was jam packed.After a short 10 minute wait we were seated at probably the best seat in the house. We had amazing views of the waterfront and could hear the nearby seals.We let our waiter know we wanted to order right away since we were on a schedule and he was accommodating.I started with the pineapple mojito which was light on the liquor but large in size. Less than 5 minutes later our appetizer and main course was brought out. Wow! Lightning speed.For our appetizer we had the steamed mussels and shrimp which came on a piping hot platter. The shrimp were pretty good but the mussels stole the show.For our main course we both had the crab sandwich. Messy but absolutely delicious. Garlic fries came as the side.

Ok. I noticed it's in the heart of the tourist of Fisherman's wharf. But my friends Kevin and Brenae touted the seafood platter and overall great chow so we tried it. I'm a fan of ciopinno and this is the BEST I have ever had-Including my wife's. And the Sea bass with ball bearing sized pasta balls reminded us of how good the sea bass was weeks ago at the Dead fish in Crockett. And they both served on like kind long narrow plates. We found out This is a sister Restaurant to the Dead fish in Crockett. Great chow. Will go again and try the platter.

Me and one of my friends literally crave this place and are fully willing to make the two hour drive up there to do so! This place is a little cramped, so not the best for huge parties. And it's on the wharf, so a big tourist destination with a possible wait... but at the end all well worth it!We usually start with the cheesy garlic bread, sometimes she gets the chowder or the Cesar salad. But always the main attraction is the crab! Depending on our hunger we'll ether get the lots of crab or two crabs. It comes on a hot skillet plate with this amazing garlic butter sauce. And then we'll do a side of mussels and/ or shrimp. Of course a glass, or bottle of white wine follows. Beware, you will be messy but an extremely happy camper! The staff has always been extremely helpful and know what they are doing. The only thing is sometimes takes a little for the initial greet from your server, but once you see how popular this place is you'll completely understand. They know so much about the menu, great suggestions and always fun to speak to. And then the bussers are fantastic! You never have to ask for water or to get the plates cleaned away, and any special request is fulfilled right away!Love this place!

With all the hype of hearing about how big the crabs are here and stuff I had to come and try...well I guess that's is all it is...just hype. This place is really overrated and overpriced, but I guess it is what we got to go eat at the most tourist area ever. The wait to be seated here on a Thursday night for us was 20 mins, but the wait time isn't that bad. What I felt was bad was the host. I felt like he was a bit rude and probably over it. No matter who came to ask for a seat...there was no warmth and welcome from the host.The dining area overlooked the pier and if you're lucky there might a sea lion to entertain you. We were lucky. We got a table by the window and there was one sea lion playing on the wharf. The food here was alright. We of course had to order crab. We got the iron skilled crab for two, crab garlic pasta, a large calamari, and a small garlic French fries. The pasta was a bit on the oily side. The calamari was delicious and plenty. The French fries was a lot for it being a small. A small size was good enough to be shared among friends. The crab was a bit on the salty side with the sauce. If you scrapped the sauce off then it would be perfect. Do be careful though there are pepper corn on it. I bit into two of these and my tongue was numb for a while. The crabs though on the bright side is super fresh.

Overpriced tourist trap with high prices and long wait times. The place is cramped, noisy and hectic. Not the vibe you want sucking on some crab legs overlooking the bay. Even though the obvious reason for coming here is to eat crab or other sea creatures, it's worth mentioning if there is anyone with dietary restrictions in your party, they'll be stuck ordering a side of steamed veggies or fries like I was. There are no gluten-free options, and they charge $9 for a small dish of steamed frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. You know, the kind you buy at the Supermarket for $1 a pound. The $24 crab Caesar salad was equally overpriced and less than mediocre, with barely an ounce of crab meat on it. Don't waste your time or money.

We waited maybe half an hour before we got our seats. The place was packed with many people waiting outside around dinner time. I was delighted by how quickly the food came out, considering how long I waited for a seat. We ordered the crab clam chowder as an appetizer. I was actually very disappointed by it. For some reason I thought it would be similar to clam chowder but with crab. Sadly it was nothing like that and it almost just tasted bland with a lot of veggies in it. I didn't enjoy it at all.For the main dish we ordered garlic noodles with crab and the crab alfredo. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the garlic noodle dish was way better than the alfredo. The garlic noodle was bursting with flavor and the added crab was a must. The crab definitely made the dish. As for the crab alfredo, I didn't think there was anything too special about it. The crab was good but the alfredo wasn't great.

For what it's worth, the food could be more tasty. But let's ease into that after the basic particulars:The location is nice, easy to locate on the second floor of the area. The exterior is a nice ivory as the restaurant titles adorn the walls. It will catch your eye -- just how it caught mine.When you saunter inside the restaurant you will immediately be greeted by the staff, which is kind! They try to tend to their customers quickly and efficiently -- we were seated immediately. The walkways are compact, hard to really move around with waiters and customers bustling to and fro; nonetheless, we were seated at a dainty booth that was freshly cleaned. It is probably the restaurant style, but they do not have windows. It's a nice touch, but a bird flew inside through our "window."Moving on, the menu had a decent amount of choices for seafood lovers. You'd spend a good time perusing its contents and facing a mental debate on which plates to order. Now, most are expensive for what they are worth.Personally, their garlic fries were better than our actual course. I do not remember the exact name of our order, but it was one supreme crab and a few shrimps. The shrimps were okay, nothing special, so it was a great filler. The crab I didn't enjoy too much. To be frank, it wasn't bad -- it just was not anything special.I'd rather call my garlic fries we ordered my "dinner." We ordered the chicken alfredo as well; I couldn't even eat 1/4 of it. Yes, it was /that/ plain. The sauce was straight up cream, welling at the bottom, and not evenly coating their hard pasta. Maybe the pepper they grinded with it along with some spices bumped up the tolerance for me to have a couple of bites, but it was so incredibly plain I could not eat it. For its price as well.Aside from the simple food, their staff was nice. It was a busy day so it was understandable to why they forgot my drink, but with that aside the staff was extremely kind and patient.The noise level within the restaurant, as one might expect, is as loud as you might think it is. Converse from table to table morphs together into a loud plethora of jumbled voices, and maybe from screams of children -- if you are okay with that. I for one, found it quite rebarbative, but what could I expect.

So you're in San Francisco and you want some seafood. I mean that's just the right craving to satisfy, right? I get Fisherman's Wharf is a tourist trap, but for some reason I always come back to this place. Sure the price might be over priced for crab, but I've never been anywhere else to compare. This place is always a hit for me. The crab comes doused in this this garlic butter sauce that's TO DIE FOR on a grill. The Seafood Cioppino is delicious. Especially on a windy and cold day out on the Pier. It's mixed seafood so you get a variety of clams, mussels, calamari, etc. The service is great and the waiters always very tentative. You also get to look out and if you come on time catch the sunset!

We rarely go to San Francisco and whenever we do, we always go to Pier 39 just because they have a bunch of things to do and places to eat. We always ate at Bubba Gumps but this time we wanted something different so we gave Crab House a shot! It looked and smelled delicious but was a little iffy about trying after I saw the yelp reviews. There was quite a wait but we didn't wait too long. The seating areas were pretty small and tight. There was only room for one person to be walking at a time in between tables. I was constantly hit by waiters walking and it was annoying at times. We ordered the mussels, shrimp, and crab combo. As well as garlic fries, crab alfredo, and crab chowder. My favorite dish was probably the garlic fries and then the combo. The crab chowder didn't taste good to me at all. It was mainly veggies and barely any crab. There was also very little soup. I still prefer the taste of clam chowder. The crab alfredo was meh. It was so dry and plain. The noodles were hard and stuck together. Wouldn't order the crab chowder and the crab alfredo again. However, the combo and the garlic fries were pretty good! The portions weren't generous for the price but it tasted good. Service was okay. Our server was nice and they were pretty attentive. Despite good seafood and garlic fries, I wouldn't come back here because of the price. It's pretty expensive for a not-too-great crab. We ended up paying about $120 for the meal including tip. My bf's parents make better ones and it's cheaper too haha

I was at crab house today with my friend. We saw a hair in the bread plate. We asked the waitress to take a look, she grabbed the plate, she accidentally make the hair off the plate, we can't find. She said she didn't see the hair. Her attitude wasn't so good, and never said sorry. When I talked to the manager, he said sorry and give us a discount. I really don't mind if I pay the full amount of the meal, but I feel bad for being treated like that way.

This is our go to place for seafood in San Francisco. Although it's a tourist trap, right by the tour boats on Fisherman's Wharf, the food is always fresh and portions are huge. I made a reservation on line 7 months prior, got there early and eveything was exactly as promised. Greeted by friendly staff, our server was very attentive. Only drawback was the kids playing hide and seek at the table behind us, but thats not the restaurants fault. Place is very busy and a bit noisy, but when the sizzling crabs come out, everyone stops and grabs their phone.I love this place!

I've been coming to this place for years and they haven't disappointed me yet. We order the crab feast, garlic fries, and chowder and everything was delicious. I think this time was even better than the last time I was here a year ago.

My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch and were seated immediately on a Sunday. Our waitress was extremely helpful and sweet. The food was not bad, but nothing to remember it by. We ordered the double shrimp and whole crab plate plus a plate of garlic noodles. The crab didn't taste too fresh, but dunking it into melted butter definitely helped. Lol. The shrimp was good if not a little burnt and the garlic noodle was a bit on the chewy side. I'd have to say I give the food 2 stars. Not gonna lie - the bloody shark was bloody fantastic though!

It was our last night in San Francisco and we hadn't had seafood yet so seemed like a must do. We'd been walking around pier 39 and fisherman's wharf and ended the night here with family.The decor was fun, little crabs up to all sorts of mischief. We were packed in like sardines so ducking and holding your breath seemed necessary every time someone at a neighboring table got up or moved. Not to mention it was really hot with all that compacted body heat. And very loud. I'm a crab and shrimp lover but I wasn't too impressed with either here. As if working for your crab wasn't enough all of the shrimp was still shelled too. It was overpriced in my opinion, the quality didn't match the price. The presentation was great but the flavor wasn't there. We did order a side of pasta that was the best thing ordered in my opinion. The garlic fries were ok. I didn't try the chowder but someone else in our party did and said it was good. Next time I'd skip the crab and shrimp.

Made a reservation for 11:30 AM the Saturday after thanksgiving and upon arrival at 11:25, there was already a long line of people! Those with reservations were promptly seated and I was very happy with where my table was located as we had a prime view of the pier :-) ordered the seafood cioppino and whole crab and that was definitely enough to make the two of us full! I'll be dreaming of the cioppino for days

Can't go wrong with the Crab House!! Well, that's what I thought. Decided to celebrate the anniversary here cause nothing says love like sizzling crabs. It's right on the pier, actually confusing to find since its on the second deck. Anyways so let's start with the food*Mussels & Shrimp - Great combination, the reason you must have this is because of the sauce that they pair this up with. *Killer Crab - Dungeness Crab that can feed 2. The flavor on the crab was good, nothing special though. Either way leftovers won't exist here. So the food was good, not really a thing to complain about. But being right in the heart of the pier I was expecting something more. Maybe I was expecting for the Crabs to be fresher, I don't know, something to put these crabs over the top. As for the service...The service is the reason why I won't come back. We set a reservation and we got seated promptly. The host at the front had great energy, they greeted us "Happy Anniversary." Aaannd the pleasant service ends there. Our server didn't pay much attention to us. He was very attentive to other groups but not to us. He was very nonchalant and his lack of energy didn't make our experience a very memorable one. Maybe because we're young, not really sure why he wasn't showing us any love. Having been to Dead Fish in Crockett and the food was just as good if not better. And the service there was exceptional. Doubt I would come back to the Crab House, since the Dead Fish is a lot closer and the service was much better.

Crab House is situated in tourist-heavy Pier 39. I've noticed that there can be a long wait sometimes judging by the sight of people waiting by the doorway. It is probably a good idea to make a reservation on Opentable before you come by. If you sit by the window, you get a nice view of the water on a clear day. Crab, and shellfish in general, is one of my favorite things to eat, so I typically order from the Iron Skillet-Roasted menu. $49.95 Crab, Mussels, Shrimp Combo$49.95 Crab & Double Mussels or Double Shrimp Combo$59.95 Whole Crab & Double Mussels or Double Shrimp ComboYummy, bib-on & let's eat.Crab legs are steamed nicely and taste fresh & sweet. Get a whole crab if you like eating the tomalley, or crab pancreas, like I do. Most of the platter consists of mussels. The top of the sizzling skillet is dusted in salt, so the mussel shells are salty, but they still taste great; firm & not rubbery. The shrimp is nice and springy with a little char. It comes with garlic butter and an herb butter. They were okay, but I didn't use much of either.You can dump your shells in the bowl underneath the skillet. Plus, there are moist towelettes, which are very necessary.$18.95 Crab Cakes - not bad. It was ok, although I'm not really a fan of crab cakes, because I prefer chunks of crab meat over fried, shredded crab meat. The outside was nice and crunchy.$7.95 Garlic French Fries - crunchy, salty, & savory. Still I thought it was too expensive for a small bowl of fries even with garlic, herbs, and a bit of parmesan sprinkled on top. I've noticed quite a few people wrote about negative reactions to the service, which I found surprising, because I've always experienced friendly, efficient service here. They put the bibs on us, ask us how we're doing, and smile. But then again, I'm not familiar with how they operate when the place is super busy with a line out the door. I always enjoy a tasty and very filling meal here. Somehow I find myself ordering the same skillets over and over again. Perhaps, I'll try the cioppino next time.

The food was ok. Service was ok. We had a table of 5 and waited 1 hr to be sat. Nothing unusual since it was very busy all around us. After our food arrived we only saw our server twice. Took him a good 15-20 mins to come back to the table after we were done eating. The table bus guy brought us refills and to go boxes.

It's a very touristy place to begin with. However, I was extremely surprised that they served really good crabs! Ordered the 'lotsa crabs' for sharing together with a shrimp and mussels platter. The crabs were amazing! The garlic and butter sauce were just nice and gave the crabs a nice flavour. And they do use peppercorns so beware cause if you bite into them, they tend to give u a very numbing after taste. The shrimp and mussels were average as I thought the shrimps was not that fresh and mediocre, but the mussels were awesome! I love the garlic sauce that comes with it and compliments the freshness of the mussels.The service crew can get really busy at times and you might have to wait during peak hours after 6:30pm. So I highly recommend coming in before that time to avoid queuing and get your food out fast.

Best crab on Pier 39!I went with a large group of friends for brunch. We are not tourists, but we had just gone sailing and craved seafood. Oh boy, Crab House did not disappoint. As a rule, I tend to avoid tourist spots. They are often crowded and expensive. Although Crab House is both, the food makes it worth the occasional visit. We ordered the mussel, shrimp, and crab leg combo. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was a reasonable price for the nice establishment. Your meal comes with complimentary bread and butter, so use it to sop up any juices. I would definitely come again and order the combo to hoard by myself. Skip the appetizers and go straight to the mains.

We went there on May. The waiter said SF's crab season is done. All their crabs come from DC. Which means the crab was cooked and frozen before they cook it. And those crabs do taste like frozen crabs. If you want fresh crabs and better taste, you should go to other restaurants.

To be honest, I love the Crab House -- I've been coming here since 2005 and I bring all of my SoCal visitors here to impress them with my bread and garlic crab eating skills. Seriously, if you've never seen a 100lb girl put down 3 loaves of bread and an entire crab on her own, you should treat me to dinner. No, but seriously, the crab here is amazing and if you aren't ordering multiple loaves of bread to absorb all of the garlic-buttery-deliciousness on the skillet, you are definitely missing out.My biggest gripe during my last two visits has been the DISGUSTING floor. I almost ate it twice here, and not because I'm clumsy or choose to go out in heels. There is a layer of oil (butter?) and grime on the floor that cannot be sanitary! Also, I don't understand why, but I've been getting served cold chowder ... and that's just not okay.So although I give the crab and shrimp a solid 5 stars, the filthy floors and cold chowder bring my rating down to a 4. For a place on Pier 39 with tourist prices, I don't expect hole-in-the-wall hygiene. Get it together, Crab House -- you definitely need a steam cleaning ASAP.

If you are planning on coming here, stick to the crab. Nothing else here is that great, but the crab is delicious. They are huge, cooked perfectly, and are very easy to crack open compared to other crabs I have had. The crabs are extremely meaty and don't even need butter, but if you do want it, I Prefer the garlic butter over the lemon butter. Service was very fast and our waiter was extremely nice. The seafood stew was good, but lacking a little bit of flavor. Like I said stick to the crab!

One of my coworkers wanted to eat crab, so with the help of Yelp we found this rest. The line was huge, so we sat at the bar. They were able to accommodate us, and Tyson our server was very good.My three star review is related to the food. We had a large portion of calamari, the crab feast, and French fries.. The crab was good it just felt too greasy, in addition the sides they offer didn't offset the greasiness... I was hoping to see more sides, and more options in the menu .. Overall it didn't impress me, and is not cheap... I would go to another place.. Not this one

Came here with a few friends for dinner and I'm surprised I had never heard of this place before! I had been craving some good seafood, and this is definitely the place for it. We came on a busy Saturday night after the Christmas tree lighting, and the wait was surprisingly short.My friend and I decided to split a meal, and we ordered the whole crab, and the garlic noodles and garlic fries for the table. Everything was delicious, and the crab tasted amazing when dipped in the butter garlic sauce. Definitely regret not getting the shrimp as well but will likely be back here very soon!While a lot of the places at Pier 39 are generally tourist traps, Crab House is genuinely good and gives you quality food for the price.

For my roomie's birthday, I asked what she wanted to eat for dinner and she said CRAB! So I searched Yelp and found this joint. The reviews seemed great and the food looked awesome so done deal!I'm always a fan of places who participate in reservation apps like Open Table or Seat Me. Crab House is one of them. Super easy to set up a reservation and when you arrive, they have all your information ready. The joint reminds me of a milkshake type diner turned Crab House. Everything is so white: the walls, the tables, the floors. Lots of big windows overlooking FIsherman's Wharf. We were lucky enough to snag a table right next to the window. Our server was also pretty on it. He visited our table enough times and really helped make the experience great!For dinner, we went all out! Here's what we had: -Crab Chowder cup for $9.95. This chowder had lots of crab meat and lots of other stuff. The veggies seemed to overpower the dish only because the crab meat was shredded pretty thin. -Garlic Bread with melted mozzarella for $8.95. I liked this app. Lots of melted cheese and the bread was baked nicely as well.-Too Two Crab (Serving 2-3 people) for $89.95. OH-EM-GEE, this is the dish to get! You get two whole crabs with the inside guts cleaned out. It comes on a sizzling skillet and served with a garlic herb butter sauce for dipping. SOOOO GOOD! Lots of crab meat in the legs and body. Great deal as well!-Large iron skillet roasted Mussels and Shrimp for $39.95. Also a crowd favorite that day. The shrimp and mussels came sizzling and were flavored so well. The same butter dipping sauce made the entire dish come to life!Overall, what a great evening! Great seafood, celebrating birthdays and loving the atmosphere. I'm having guests come to town soon and I'm definitely taking them here!

My husband and I loved this place! It's a small cozy restaurant upstairs on pier39. It's fairly easy to find. We only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. I assumed a long wait, so it was a pleasant surprise. The price is fairly reasonable as well. Of course, if you cook the same items at home it would be a lot cheaper, but we are paying for the environment and service. It appears some people forget this aspect and complain about the price. Anyhow, we ordered the double shrimp and crab on a skillet and garlic noodles. We loved both dishes! I love everything about this restaurant. If you love buttery and garlicky this place is for you. Also, I love that the food comes out on a skillet. It just feels different in comparison to a plain white plate. Food sometimes tastes better because of the presentation. We will definitely be back!

Crab is one of my favorite things to eat and crab house definitely does it right. We were at pier 39 on our recent SF trip so we had to stop by and get some. Between the 6 of us, we split a crab feast, garlic fries, calamari, and I got to try some of the crab chowder. The main attraction and reason we were there, the crab feast, was delicious. The crab is nice and crispy and buttery. The shell was also easy to break which is always nice. It was so crispy that you could eat the whole end of the leg that's attached to the crab.The garlic fries were garlicky (that's a word right? It is now :) Haha) and crispy, and the calamari was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Not sure what the sauce is but it tasted like a better version of a cocktail sauce; perfect pairing to the calamari. For as good as the meal was, the crab chowder missed the mark. I was excited to try it only to find out it was a little bland and flat. Overall our experience was good. The service was great as all of our needs were taken care of in a timely manner and the food came out quickly. This place is a bit pricey..being about $40 a person between 6 for the above mentioned. But, it's also crab so it's kind of expected. If you're not on a budget I'd highly recommend this spot; I'd pass on the crab chowder though.

We always come here once a quarter for their Killer Crab for two. It's the best period.And we also share the caesar salad. Sometimes if we are hungrier we also get their garlic noodles which are just ok.Been coming here for many years with family and friends and this is the best crab I have had in SF.

Came back for a second try. Much better experience than our first time. Service was excellent and our food was delicious. I am a crab snob having grown up on fresh Dungeness crab in Bodega Bay. I ordered the fresh Dungeness crab which had delicious seasoning that still allowed the sweet taste of the crab to shine. The calamari was much better this time as well. Everything our party ordered was excellent.My advice would be to come at a time when they're not crazy busy - it will allow for a much more pleasant experience.

Came after my wife ate here in December and couldn't stop raving about the place. We had lotsa crab (enough for 2) and it didn't disappoint. As a side I ordered garlic noodles and side veggies. The veggies were nothing special, but the crab and noodles were out of this world! Highly recommend both and I'm looking forward to coming back to explore the rest of the menu.About the service. We came on a Saturday at 6pm on the same day as the Giants fanfest and the Chinese new year parade. Suffice to say the place was jumping. Our server David was totally awesome!!! He exceeded our expectations and is an upright, honest gentleman. If any manager is reading this, David is a man of integrity and your company should be proud to employ. PM me if you want to know the specifics.

I expected the killer crab for a long time so here is the first place I gone when I arrival San Francisco. We arrival the crab house around 4pm and there is not so many people, we have two people and waited for about 15minutes although there were many seats available. No way to get a window seat for just two people because they left all window seats to 3 or more people. We ordered the whole crab and it was so great you have to try if you go there! We had one small order shrimps another small order of mussels not such special but were okay. I'll comeback again for the crab!

This is located on Pier 39 where there is plenty of shopping and things to do around the area. Parking is a bit tough, but there is always a the parking garage right across the street ( a little bit pricey almost $10 an hour!! ) and the restaurants will validate to save you a little bit of money. If you make a reservation it makes it easier for you to get a table, because during high volume times there is usually a wait. We made reservation earlier that afternoon and requested for an ocean view to celebrate an anniversary. When we got there we were seated right away. The server and staff are all very friendly, kept our water refilled. We got a window seat ....such a gorgeous view to have dinner. We ordered the small steam clams, whole crab with their special garlic sauce, and small crab chowder. They have a wall of HOT SAUCES that was kind of cool to be able to choose what kind of hot sauce you want. They have different sauces from mild to extreme. The "TOXIC" hot sauce is crazy hot! If you are someone who likes hot stuff try that sauce out! The crab flavor was okay, it came out on a hot plate and it was a pretty presentation. The crab was very fresh and the meat fell out of the shell easily. The small bowls of clams was a good size to share for two people. It was very fresh and did not taste like the salt water from the ocean. The crab chowder was delicious!! The small is really enough just for one person. They use real dungeons crab meat in it. There is a small bar inside the restaurant with a small drink menu as well!!Be aware that there is a small SF fee on the receipt and that is not part of tips (kinda weird).
