Just wanted to issue a correction on somebody else's review: valet parking is not free, they add $18 to your bill. Which is completely appropriate at such a fine dining restaurant. Just wanted to clear that up. I do love how they take your car and don't give you any kind of ticket - they know who you are and when you're done with your meal, there isn't any kind of waiting. They already have your car out front waiting for you. I could go on about the impeccable food and friendly, attentive service but others have already reviewed that aspect plenty. Five stars on all fronts.

The taste, presentation, attention to detail, uniqueness is absolutely exquisite. The only thing I did not enjoy was the wine pairing. Majority of the wine was overwhelming the flavors of the food. Quick highlight: - the quince pasta with truffle should not be a dish that gets put inside the Quince special box. It tasted like any regular pasta with truffle, there's nothing unique in flavor about it. There are so many other dishes that are worthy of "Quince" special box. - I ate a fish that had to be reeled in from a fish bowl!!! THIS is worthy of their Quince special dish. Flavor was clean and delicate. It was delicious. Just open your mouth and it'll automatically jump in.

Quince's extreme attention to detail really stands out from the crowd and it will be our go to place for special occasions. We drove there and valet greeted us and parked our car for free. I didn't expect that in the heart of SF, but it was much appreciated. When we were done dining, the car was waiting for us outside, no need to call anyone about it. Say what? Thank you!When my husband called to make the reservation, they asked him if it was a specially occasion. My husband informed them that it was our anniversary. When we came in, they printed our names and happy anniversary on the menu, which was so considerate. It's a small detail that made the experience so personal. The decor is industrial glam, with soaring ceilings and exposed brick. Tall drapes separates the room into many sections of 3-4 tables. It somehow felt open and cozy at the same time. The presentation, taste, variety, preparation, and sheer amount of food is just mind blowing. You have to experience to understand because it is not good food that fill your stomach, it is editable art. The desert course is a full cart(30 kinds) of house made exotic cake/candy/pie/tart/compote and much more, and they encourage you to try them all! We had the tasting menu, 7 drinks (don't judge), 2 cheese supplement course, and 2 tea, and it came out to be $780 before tips. It is the most amazing food related experience we have ever had. If you are have a special someone, take them here, you won't be disappointed.

"Quince" is the "epitome of impeccability!"Dinner was quite an experience! An amazingly unforgettable experience! Everything about Quince is absolute perfection! Food, ambiance, service... "Inarguably Exquisite!"I can not even begin to describe the "out of this world deliciousness" of my seven course dinner. It was heaven from beginning to end!

This might be a bit harsh but I expected to be wowed by a 3star Michelin restaurant.The service was impeccable, we were in a private dining room for a work dinner, the drinks were served, we saw the cellar, great ambiance and company. The food:Farm egg: beautiful, rich but bland and needed something to cut through the richnessTsar Nicoulai Caviar: best dish of the night, the cream, beets, everything worked together perfectly Garganelli: I found it bland and the pasta hard, but lobster and foam were amazing Japanese Wagyu: beautiful dish and flavors but I didn't care for the think slices of the meat as presentation and found it a bit chewy Guanaja chocolate cremeux: by this time I was full but did taste it, very delicate flavors and light, great dish The wine pairings were all good, but I favored the reds. Again the food has to taste amazing and I'd expect nothing less.

3 persons+1 kid + tip= $1200The environment is really classy, big too, there is a private area where you can host a birthday party 6+, which is very rare for a Michelin 3 star restaurant!And they don't force the 5-years kid to order fixed menu, which is a plus A big collections of decanters, beautiful and comfy chairs; great service, but if you r a Chinese, you might not like the food; the food is just so-so for a typical Chinese.If you add $85, you can get the best caviar, which makes me so satisfied and happy, strongly recommended.Remember to cancel it at least 48 hours before hand to avoid extra charge if you have to cancel it.The dessert is just so-so; nothing impressive.

Amazing 12-course fantastical menu! The food is well deserving of it's 3 star Michelin mark. Service was above and beyond! We even got a tour of the kitchen and treated to "frozen" cocktails and hot chocolate. Will be coming back here soon!

Quince was exceptional. The courses were well presented and tasted amazing. The service was phenomenal, and they were nice enough to give us a tour of the kitchen. I had called in advance to let them know it was a friends bday, and sure enough they brought out a dessert for him as well, as well as print his name of the menus. Our meal started at 8 and ended at around 11:30. I believe they end the meal with a hot chocolate but because they were closing, they got us the got chocolate to go. It was cold already, which was the one blotch on an otherwise exceptional meal.

Definitely feeling like a princess at Quince. My BF took me here on my birthday in December and we were definitely excited. It was both our first times at a 3 star Michelin restaurant, heck first time at any Michelin rated restaurant. We found pretty close street parking about 2 blocks down and as we walked to the front door, you pass their kitchen. You can look in and watch for a little. As we entered, the host graciously took my jacket to be hung and brought us to our seats. We were seated and both ordered a drink. We chose our pre-fixe menu and proceeded to wait for the courses to come out. The food was delicious and unique. I never experienced anything like this before. Each item is bite size entrees but they do fill you up. I was sad to say by the last two entrees, I can only take a nibble. I was immensely full. The waiter let us try one of each of their dessert cart and he packaged me some cream puffs to go. The whole dinner experience took about 2.5 hours. As we left, we were greeted by the host with my jacket, cream puffs, and complimentary egg nog to sip as we walked out. The service is impeccable and superb. I don't think I have enough positive adjectives to even describe. The food was innovative and divine.

We celebrated Valentines at Quince this year. Since we were going to be busy on the actual day, BF made reservations to dine here the day before. Since this was our first time at a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant, we were both excited and had high expectations. We each started with a cocktail, a rum one for the BF and a mezcal one for me. We enjoyed both of them! Since it was a Monday, we opted to go for the abbreviated Winter menu. I don't eat red meat, and the menus we received already had the options substituted for me! My favorite was the caviar course. Absolutely DIVINE!! The pasta dishes were the star of the meal. I loved the garganelli with lobster and mushrooms. My main entree was the black sea bass while BF had the veal. The fish was cooked perfectly!Service was top notch from beginning to end. Tip: Don't forget to ask for a tour of the kitchen! It's a lot smaller than you'd imagine, but it's impeccable! It was cool to see everyone in action!While it was a great meal, I'm not sure if either of us were really WOWed by the food itself. Maybe we were expecting too much. But for the price tag, I thought it to be a bit lack luster.But the overall experience was memorable and really made for a wonderful night and Valentine's celebration!

I am going to start by saying that after our dinner here, this is my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco! From the moment we walked in and told hostess our names, every single person that was working there, greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary. We even had a personalized menu with our names on it!For the first time ever, considering that you can order only (two kinds) of the tasting menu, every single dish, was simply phenomenal!Even bread and butter were home made and tasted out of this world!Two options for dinner, $210, and last 2,5h or $250, 3,5hours.They are really accommodating with the dishes, so if you don't eat something or don't like something from one menu, they will swap it with anything from the other.I have no right words to describe the taste of the dishes, they were all simply magnificent.Service was fantastic. You could hardly see the waiters, but they were always there when you need them. We had new dishes coming on every 5 to 10 minutes.Gorgeous place with incredible service.Truly unforgettable experience.Quince, you will see us again!

My very lovely boyfriend took us here for a celebratory dinner last night - lucky me! We were joined by our friends, one who had to abstain from food due to a recent illness. We called ahead of time to check and see if she was still able to go without ordering, and the restaurant was very accommodating, saying that it wouldn't be an issue.The atmosphere itself was very intimate and quiet, it was nice being able to listen to ourselves and our company talk. It was a 12-course prix fixe menu, and 3 in particular stood out to me: the caviar atop brioche, the garganelli (lobster), tortelli (porcini mushroom), and the strawberry dessert with smoked caramel coffee. All three had phenomenal flavors, I definitely could've used more than one portion of each! Quality over quantity, however. We also opted for an add-on, the foie gras, which was exceedingly rich and buttery. I was glad that my non-eating friend was also catered to as well, our servers would ask her if they could get her anything at all, and her water cup was always well-filled. She did have some of our bread during the bread course, and a bite or two of her husband's dessert. Service was exemplary overall. The entire dinner was a 3.5 hour affair, and I quite enjoyed being able to savor all of my food. The reason it's missing that last star is because for the price of the meal, I was expecting one dish to blow my mind and my tastebuds. While all dishes were very good, not one was THE one, and I was just missing that wow factor. However, I truly enjoyed the food there and am happy to have finally tried a Michelin-starred restaurant.

I really think Zagat did a better job highlighting Quince as "hard-to-top". As one of the top French cuisine with Italian tilt, this husband-and-wife restaurant indeed has nailed every single course on their tasting menu, and left us nothing but full of impressive mementos.We opted for the tasting menu in order to experience everything. After some small bites, we embraced our first course - a dog in search for gold. Such a lovely name, as it has perfectly described what we have seen: a lovely dog happily running in a forest, looking for its own food! Quince certainly also did a good job in seafood - that small piece of king crab with caviar on top, tenderly cooked while still maintained its rudimentary freshness. I deeply enjoyed my squab, which carried a light touch of mushroom scent, adorable! Last highlight of our meal came with dessert - pear with chocolate, so crispy! I simply could not think of a better way to end my meal! Is there a better restaurant in SF? Probably. Is there a better one that could present each course in an impeccable way? I doubt it! From the beginning all the way till the end, this Michelin three starred restaurant continued to impress me with its unique imagination and creativity. I'm quite sure that it is that piece of jigsaw brings in all the uniqueness of taste, together with its fame. Well done Quince! Congratulations on earning your third star this year, you truly deserve it!

It is a 3 star Michelin, they got that right and deserving! Dining here is like an experience, every dish that comes out is like a piece of art but also flavorful. To appreciate this place you will have to be a connoisseur and that perspective will change the way you enjoy this place.The food has influences from all over the world and then go with their wine pairing, that tops of the experience for your dinner.. we got sake, wines from Australia, France, Italy, Austria and also our So Californian wines... We dined from 7:30-11:30 pm! I couldn't believe it but we sat there, ate (a lot) and drank (a lot) for four hours! Service is impeccable and food is delicious..

My Christmas gift to myself this year was food. What's better than a 3 michelin star restaurant?I tried to keep my expectations reasonable since every time I'm overly excited about dining somewhere, I leave disappointed. The thing is, I think if I came to Quince with ridiculously high expectations, I would've left completely satisfied. I was honestly blown away by the food at Quince. Dish after dish it was back and forth of OOH's and AHH's. The "A Dog in Search of Gold" presentation was out of this world, and super cute. My least favorite of the night was the lobster, which was lacking flavor in my opinion. Presentation, however, was beautiful. My favorites were the soup and the pasta with white truffles served in a Quince box.The service was amazing here and surprisingly unpretentious. Sadly, I was hungover beyond belief from the night before so I was unable to have the wine pairing with my meal. Our servers were very understanding of that and even joked about it with me (several times throughout the meal, which made me feel so comfortable).Real people. Real food. Simply amazing.P.S. They tailored the menu for my pesceterian needs. EVEN ON PRINT OUT! Saved for life :)

My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here last week. This food was almost too beautiful to eat. Every course came out more impressive than the last and we literally felt like we were in food heaven. I highly recommend this place if you're ever in SF - they are so attentive and thoughtful about every single detail. Before you can want for anything, it's right in front of you. They make you feel so special and the food is insanely creative. It was one of the best meals of our entire lives!

If I have an option to give as many stars to Quince as possible, you just need to look up at the bright night sky...a truly sensational experience!When you arrive at the front door, you will see chef Michael Tusk's kitchen staff working through the huge glass windows. Upon entering, we were welcomed to the sophisticated and chic setting with a glass of champagne by our server Milton. Quince has two menu options, the Indian Summer Menu for $165 with an optional $150 wine pairing, and the Quince Menu at $220 with an optional $180 wine pairing.Every beautifully presented course has unique glassware, plates and utensils--allowing the food to shine, truly highlighting the ingredients. So astonishing that I almost just want to look at and admire each course...then again, to fully respect it, I must fulfill its purpose and indulge in it. I was continually amazed with the service--consistently caring and intelligent.I've been blessed enough to enjoy many fine restaurants in the world and Quince by Grand Chef Michael Tusk has been the most memorable one to date.Make a reservation and enjoy this delightful event.

In short, very mediocre. Not wonderful, not terrible, and the food wasn't particularly memorable. Some dishes were (of course) very excellent, some dishes were just A-OK. The service was excellent. I don't think I need to harp on the food much, as people who are more "foodie" than me can provide their feedback. All I can say is, at this price range, food isn't going to taste bad. The only thing I want to point out in this review is that the portion size is way too big! You may think that this is a great thing, and who can complain about having too much food at $200+ per person. Well, it takes away the elegance and classiness of the restaurant, not to mention the discomfort of walking away feeling way too full. High-end restaurants with tasting menus should leave you full, but not stuffed; you should have the slight sensation of "wanting more." Not, "I'm not coming back for a LONG time." I've felt very full at other high-end restaurants, but Quince was over-the-top! Maybe they should have different portion sizes for people to choose from? They told me that the smaller menu serves the same amount of food, just less variety than the bigger menu. Anyway, this is the most uncomfortably stuffed I've ever felt at a restaurant of this caliber. Food was great/good, but nothing too special or unique.

Got to see Mark Zuckerburg walk by our table with his entourage when we dined in (3/4/17)... no biggie haha... Overall a great experience, and for the standard ("Quince") tasting menu starting at $220, I'd say it's one of the better valued 3 Michelin star restaurants around the Bay. Price for 2 people without wine pairing + 20% tip + tax + additional $40 foie gras dish set us back about $675. THE GOOD:- Reservations were easy to make - We were able to book a 9pm Saturday dinner time (ok it's a tad late, i guess lol) 5 days before. - Service (minus the mistake I noted below) was good, as expected^ part of that - I really liked the menu with our names and celebratory purpose on it. A customer care rep called us a day before to confirm the spelling of our names.- Kitchen tour with free picture and alcoholic sorbet snacks...We thought we were special, but apparently it's something they offer every table, which is cool. Transparency and added value is always cool.- We got a complimentary anniversary mini cake added to our dessert line up :))) - Half of the dishes were mind-blowing (see pictures for more details)THE MEH:*** Dropped dish (-.5 stars*)? I don't blame this on the waiter at all, as the dishes he delivered were stacked in an odd way... but when he did make it to my side of the table, a tier of the caviar fell from the structure and pieces of sauce and food fell onto my table, chair, and dress... The waiter fumbled, quickly apologized, picked up the dish, and ran into the kitchen to recover a new one... 5 minutes later he came back and gave me a towel and asked if any got on me. Not the experience I was hoping for my first 3 Michelin star restaurant - I recommend more ergonomically designed dishes for the waiters. What's the point of it being pretty/edgy when incidents like these are going to happen.***Horrible draft (-.5 stars*) - It was raining the day we came, and as a result a lot of wind was blowing around. Quince doesn't have double interior doors (not sure what they're called), so when someone leaves or enters, it would send a cold draft into the restaurant... We sat close to the door, and I was rubbing my arm and pretty much freezing the entire time in my dress. Mentioned this to the waiters, but there's not much they could do besides offer me my coat.*** The dishes were 50/50 to me (-.5 stars*)- I'd like most, if not all of my dishes to taste good during expensive dinners - wouldn't you? I guess the search continues for a better 3 mich. *** Limited bathroom access, there are two gender-neutral bathrooms at the end of their hall. There was a 4 person line when I went to use it... ***They didn't have the dessert cart during our night :(((( ... We got some desserts at the end (see pictures), but I was really looking forward to being overwhelmed by the cart...it would have ended the night out nicely. In the future, I guess you should call in advance to see if they have it because if I knew they didn't have it that day, I'd personally reconsider.Taking Quince for everything that it and our wallet claims it to be, I have to give it 3.5 stars - rounded up to 4 on Yelp.. It'll be a long while until I consider coming back.

5 stars. Definitely worth every dollar. Visiting Quince is always like a mystery. You don't exactly know what they will be serving on their menu as it changes seasonally/regularly. It is like a surprise every single time. Walking in here gives me the vibe of dinning in a dark room, kind of mysterious but yet you feel relaxed. In every corse of the meal, the server would prepare your food for you and your friends at the same time. I find that impressive sometimes because they have to serve all the dishes at the same time. They tell you the name of the dish and described the dish in bits of details which you find it interesting sometimes. If you ever feel curious about what you are eating, you are more than welcome to ask them- they are passionate in what they do and they will do whatever to have their customers satisfied.My favorite part of the course would be the dessert cart. The dessert cart is what I wish to have one just like it at home and put whatever sweets I want on it. If you are ever looking to splurge on a dinner, come to Quince. You will leave with a chocolaty sweet smile! :)

Underwhelming.I would expect a 3 Michelin Star experience to be excellent. Exquisite food, phenomenal service, inspired presentation, an experience to remember. This was not it.The only dish worth mentioning was the caviar, which managed an interesting mix a flavors, the rest were largely forgettable at best and poorly executed at worst. Presentation was good but not terribly inspired.The service was extremely uneven. Some waiters engaged while others largely ignored us. We ran out of water and wine on multiple occasions and visible crumbs were not cleared from the table throughout the meal.All in all, a memorable evening for all the wrong reasons.

The lowdown: impeccable warm service in a cavernous comfort castle. The food itself was immaculate but a bit too earthbound to wow me.Whereas a lot of high gastro-temples lean more towards rare seafood and A++ grade meat ingredients, the most notable flavor profiles here were earthy and country comfort: cheese, mushrooms, small cuts of smokey meats, grains, pasta, squash, all of it heightened by delicate dabs of truffles and caviar. The whole feeling is very autumnal, like a fall harvest for a medieval king in a landlocked country. It felt more traditional rather than virtuosic. The couple seated next to us repeatedly said they much prefer this to a good seafood meal, so I'm willing to concede that rustic landfare just isn't my thing.My favorite bite was oddly the frog's leg tempura amuse bouche in the beginning, followed by the lobster garganelle. The lobster was probably the single most springy, succulent bite of lobster I have ever enjoyed. I was hoping there were more moments like this, but the cheese-and-grains leanings were much more to the fore than any succulent fish or flesh or meats. It made the price tag seem a little steep at the end, when Cotogna next door already excels at so many of these same grainy flavor notes.The waitstaff knew it was an anniversary and never failed to make my date and I feel welcomed and attended to. At the end, they sent us off with cups of hot chocolates. We walked away smiling from the warmth of the people. I have to give really high plaudits for that -- it's a lovingly wrought feasting temple, and I want so very much for everyone to succeed here, but the price was hard to sleep on relative to the food, which is a bit of a pity, I think.

Possibly the most luxurious dining experience I've ever had and I've eaten all over the world. Every course of this tasting menu was done to perfection. If you confuse pretentiousness with luxury, this is not the place for you. It's expensive and formal. I was a little put off when I read that they have a dress code, being the rebel that I am. Once inside you will see why. The waitstaff was like a highly trained army with utmost courtesy and attentiveness. We were invited into the kitchen for one of our courses. That kitchen is a totally heads-down operation to a person. Chef/Owner Michael Tusk came to our table (there is only one 2 top table) and chatted with us and I got to compliment him on his art collection, which adorns the walls of Quince with spectacular opulence. The one negative is that we were seated in the section where the staff goes from the kitchen to all the other dining areas so it was constant "background action" whizzing by our table which was distracting from the experience, thus the "army" reference. Not just one at a time but 6 or 7 people all in a line heading to and from the kitchen. Next time I will request different seating. When making reservations make sure to say that you don't want to eat in the way back in front of the private dining room and the somm station.

Our daughter's baby sitter canceled on us today. So we brought her with us to celebrate her dad's bday dinner. She is 7 and a half months old. This would obviously be her first time at a Michelin star restaurant. She got to meet San Antonio Spurs Coach Popovich who said, "she's so precious!" He happened to be here having dinner with his beautiful wife.The staff was so incredibly accommodating to our daughter and our situation. They even brought out ice in a cloth because our daughter was teething. They let us use a larger private room with more space to accommodate us.Thank you so much to the staff for such an amazing experience. Thank you for being so nice and for stopping by to say hello to our baby girl. We very thankful for everything!!

What else can I say that the other 1200+ reviews haven't already stated? This dining experience was absolutely phenomenal. The one thing that stuck out to me was the restaurants ability to provide the "fine dining" experience without over suffocating you. I appreciated the space and also the regard to our table. They've definitely mastered the balance. On another note, I've never tried caviar before, and it was probably my favorite dish on the tasting menu! Can't wait to come back!

An experience of a lifetime! Quince was as good as all the reviews we had seen - from the fascinating courses and incredibly rich taste to the attentive service full of laughter and bon-homie, Quince is a must-do in San Francisco. Everyone on the staff seemed to know that my husband and I were celebrating a special time in the city and were so gracious about accommodating our preferences. The red wine that was recommended to us was delicious Sonoma grown Pinot Noir and went perfectly with the food and our moods! Thank you, team Quince for a wonderful night in the city.

I was honestly quite surprised when I heard Quince received its third Michelin star this year. Though I didn't have an unpleasant experience, nothing I had at Quince was particularly memorable or worth going back for. For a $220 tasting menu, I hoped to leave the place with my mind blown but instead it left me with questions like, "Why did I need 4 dessert courses to end my meal?" and "Why did everything taste so salty?". The tasting menu I had included 11 courses, 3 of which were dessert plus an extra slice of cake since I was celebrating my birthday. Of the courses I tried, the only ones that I truly enjoyed were the lamb, salmon, and oyster (see photos). All the other savory courses were just a little too salty for my taste. I do give Quince props for presentation. Everything was plated so beautifully and service was very attentive. My best friend who normally has a huge sweet tooth also commented on the number of desserts we were served and was reaching for her glass of water more so than usual by the end of our meal. PS. At its current price point, it's the cheapest three Michelin star in the bay.

Came to Quince with my friend at the end of March and made it in time before they raised the price for Quince menu! We were pretty excited to dine there since we have never been to a 3 Michelin star restaurant. We made our reservation 3 weeks in advance and were able to get a 8:30pm slot on a Friday night. I didn't give Quince 5 stars because I was expecting to be more impressed since it has 3 Michelin stars. Overall the food was great, and the service was superb. I really appreciated the presentation and intricacy of each dish. It truly brings your dining experience to another level. I like how they are quite flexible with the menu. They allow adjustments to the menu if you have dietary restrictions, so my friend was able to substitute the lamb dish for fish since she doesn't eat lamb. The only major complaint I have is that the wait time between courses was too long. For a 12 course meal, our dinner lasted over 3 hours. The portion of food for each course was pretty small, but we were very full by the end of the night because it took so long.I loved the plating of every dish; it was just so entertaining to look at. My favorites were canape, white asparagus, and garganelli. The canape was cute small bites. I liked the warm pastry puffs with cheese inside and the croquette the most. They were just fun to eat, and I loved it when the cheese exploded in my mouth. The white asparagus was something I had never eaten before, and the way the prepared it was very interesting. They brought out a huge glass container of yuzu marinate where the asparagus was soaking in all the flavors. The waiter picked out the asparagus and topped it with a sauce made with vin jaune and morel mushrooms. The asparagus was very tender and rich in flavors. The left over yuzu marinate was made into tea, and it had an intense savory and sweet yuzu flavor along with a mild citrus taste. It was the most unique tea I had ever had! Another dish I really enjoyed was the garganelli, which had lobster meat wrapped in it. The texture of the pasta was perfect, and it was topped with foam that actually had a taste. I didn't like one of the desserts but definitely enjoyed the variety of desserts the dessert cart offered and ended up getting one of each!I would recommend dinning at Quince. I had a positive experience overall, and the price is very reasonable for a 3 star restaurant in SF.

The restaurant is gorgeous, immaculate interior and layout, exceptional service, great ambiance, excellent wine list but sort of bummed out about the food. I feel sincerely bad saying this but I expect more from a 3 Michelin star restaurant in terms of temperature of the dishes and flavors. The ingredients all seem to be flavorful and composed well in to the dishes, but the temperature of some of the courses was not quite optimal for the flavors to register. Textural consistency of some of the meats could be an outcome of the same. Overall enjoyed celebrating birthday and staff is extremely friendly and accommodating but 50% of the tasting menu was below average - taste/temperature/texture wise resulting in sub par flavors.

Catch 3 Michelin stars here at Quince right in between FiDi and North Beach! It's been my experience with 3 Michelin star spots that it's as much about the company, ambiance, wine, and the experience as it is about the amazing food. Of course the food is awesome, but make sure you bring good people with you because the experience itself can take several hours. Wine helps here as a bit of social lubricant so don't forget to go with the wine pairing. One odd thing was receiving a beer paired with one of the dishes... I felt that was a bit out of place given the ~$700 per person price tag (tasting menu + upgrades + wine pairing + tax/tip). Other than that, it was a great experience!

Amazing experience and so worth it! Service was spectacular. The staff was a beautiful well oiled machine that genuinely cared about my dining experience. They went over and above and made sure each of my requests were met. Have been to Meadowood and Manresa and felt the service was not as wonderful as Quince. The food was delicious and I left perfectly full. The sea bass dish surprised me and ended up being my favorite of the evening. The wine pairings blew me away and truly brought forth the best of each dish. The wine pairing is a must!! I got the cheese supplement as well which was delicious and had five different cheeses to try along side the best bread! The dessert cart was a thing of beauty and elegance. They even gave me a goodie bag to take home! Highly recommend this dining experience

Best restaurant I have been to so far. A mesmerizing ambiance. Elite service. And of course, delectable food. I sat in the lounge area, and ordered everything of the salon menu. The presentations of the meals were artistic. The ingredients were fresh. The courses could even be deemed classics. Will definitely return.

This dinner was so lovely in food and presentation. Their service is just, next level, with personalized, thoughtful, touches that made the entire experience very memorable from start to finish. We got to sit in the kitchen for one of our courses; it was really fun to see the staff in their element. The maitre'd was also a super warm and attentive host!

I had already picked out Quince as my choice for our 10th anniversary dinner when I found out they had been given their third Michelin star. They're on just about every list of must-try restaurants in San Francisco, so again I was anticipating highly. The atmosphere was even more upscale and obviously fancy than I remember The French Laundry being, and I automatically felt nervous. But again the staff was so warm and welcoming that I was immediately put at ease.We were about fifteen minutes early for our reservation, and they were apologetic that our table wasn't ready yet--we didn't mind! We were early. When the time came the table still wasn't ready and they enticed us into the salon and offered us a complimentary glass of champagne--I'm still in the beginning of my wine appreciation years, but it was without doubt one of the most delicious wines I've ever had.I don't remember our primary server's name but he was fantastic. He was obviously having a great time doing his job and made the experience even better for us. Service overall was, as expected, impeccable. The food was inventive without being precious. Standouts: the gougeres!, poached asparagus with morels, tortellini with pork (served in a rolling pin with plating tweezers as a fun nod to chef's tools), the lamb plate (with sweetbreads, sausage, chop, and ash-grilled shoulder and belly--I didn't even know lamb could taste like this), dessert plate with sorbet, gelee, and an ice liquid poured over--texturally interesting and great. I also had the foie gras, which I had never tried before, and it was just incredible. My spouse declined the foie gras, and they brought him a ricotta raviolo so he would have something to eat at the same time.They also offered us a chocolate-and-rhubarb cake for our anniversary celebration, which was very kind of them. And despite having already eaten almost too much, we ended up eating the entire cake, too. It was soooo light and fluffy. We had our sweet cart selections packed for us, and they were handed to us at the door with a minicup of hot chocolate on the way out. Outstanding start to finish.

This is a high end restaurant. They accommodate vegetarians well & also those who don't drink alcohol. We had their vegetarian tasting menu. The food was very good & creative, using unique items such as herbs & other ingredients. You have to leave 3 hours to dine here. Come here for a dining experience or special occasion. I am not giving it a 5 as the desert we got was not very good - essentially some chocolates, caramel & one other item - I would have expected a high end restaurant to prepare something such as a cake or mousse, for the price we paid of $250 per person, plus drinks, taxes, & tips. The Taj Campton Place still stands as my favorite high end place in San Francisco The 1st time we dined at Quince a few years ago one item came to us which was not vegetarian, but they more than made up for that error with the manager personally checking everything after & this time we did not have that problem. The 1st time we dined here, we were also shown the kitchen - very clean & organized.

DRIP, DRIP, DROP...There goes a mouthgasm. As a woman you're practically built to have multiple O's during one session. Here at Quince, they make them completely attainable with their intricate dishes, which will have you yearning for more! Really though, you'll kinda want some more because the elegant portions are petite. Be sure to appreciate that each bite, holds multidimensional flavor. This is not the type of dinner you rush through. Keyword= Savor. An exceptional experience overall: timed service, complex flavors, magnetic ambiance. My husband and I wanted to experience different prix fixe 10-course menus, so he ordered the Garden Menu, while I ordered the Quince Menu. The Garden Menu was actually better! No worries, Garden Menu doesn't only have veggies. My favorite dishes were the Black Cod and Phil Paine's Squab. Order both menus. + Reservation cancellations must be made at least 48 hrs in advance to avoid a $220/person cancellation fee+ Personalized menus to take home for special occasions

It'd been a while since I'd been in San Francisco to try some of the finest dining in town (at least according to what Michelin says), so I was excited for our dinner at Quince. Given that they had just achieved the pinnacle with their third star, it definitely feels like you are in a treat when you get seated. The restaurant is housed in an older structure, with lots of exposed brick giving it a very homey feeling. With parts of the dining room sectioned off by curtains (which is where we were - off to the right side, with only one other couple at the other side of our section), it has an extremely intimate feeling despite the largeness of the space and the high ceilings. The service here was phenomenal, with extremely friendly waiters who detailed every last sauce and dressing of the food and chatted us up beyond the food as well. The drinks menu (particularly the wine) is extensive, but I had my first Pliny the Elder (which I'd heard much about) to start, and then a couple of absolutely delicious cocktails to round off the rest of the meal. My wife had tea service, and with teas sourced from Song Tea - her favorite tea shop probably anywhere - she was a big fan.On the weekend, only the main Quince menu is offered (during the weekday, you can choose a seasonal tasting menu as well). However, you could add 2 dishes - a risotto or a fondue course; while the fondue sounded amazing, we opted to only go with one (the risotto, which we both had to order), as the menu looked plenty daunting to start with (11 courses, including dessert). The food is inspired by French and (more clearly) Italian cuisine, but the food is definitively contemporary American in its interpretation, and with a very big focus on locally sourced food from nearby farms. This was my first experience at a purely West Coast 3-star Michelin restaurant, but compared to Chicago (where the critics and high-end restaurants veer towards the experimental) and NYC (which hews more closely to what I feel is Old World preparation, with exceptions such as Chef's Table), the food at Quince seemed to take a more contemporary approach to the food. Frog's leg tempura and a parmesan-infused marshmellow were a couple of the delicious bites to start, showcasing different takes on those Old World flavors. A pumpkin-oat croquette had a sturdy meatiness and flavor despite having no meat. The start of the meal focused on creamy decadence - caviar served on brioche and on a blini with edible silver (the first edible metal of the night), with a richly flavorful hollandaise to dip in without the heaviness that usually has brunchers hankering for a nap. The Scottish lobster was poached masterfully, with thick drops of truffle-infused sauce adding that signature earthiness to each bite. Next up was a veloute-based soup served with celeriac, a generous chunk of creamy burrata, and leafs from brussel sprouts, all topped off with more slices of black truffle - a delicious dish perfect for the wintertime.We started moving into the pasta portion hereafter with the risotta - a green color due to plankton(!), served with a few pieces each of uni and king crab. Aside from the color, the plankton makes it a salty dish that has a lot of warmth to it...perhaps the most memorable dish and a delicious one to boot. The bottoni pasta was delicious - another dish with pumpkin, a warm broth with a black tea base and parmesan fizz giving it a (very) light cheesy finish. The artichoke was the one dish I was a bit agnostic on - the presentation wasn't that appealing, and I'm not a big artichoke person to start, but the creme fraiche and truffles (again!) made it another dish perfect for the colder months. The guianciale pasta was a celebration of carrots - topped with carrot sauce and with pasta made with carrots, served with 'ash butter', it was a very rustic take on pasta that dialed back the richness of the other dishes. The tortelli was served in dishes as well as in a grater that was opened up, showing even more. The suckling pig filling was so juicy, and it worked great with rich barolo-infused sauce, making every tiny bite juicy and succulent. The last main dish - the venison - was the most straightforward, and while it was very good, particularly the jus, which amplified the gamey flavor - it was not as interesting and compelling as everything else we had.The attention at dessert undoubtedly goes towards the massive cart of petit fours at the end, where you can take as much as you can manage - and there are so many delicious choices - but I actually liked the bearss lime crumble, which looks and has a bit of the texture of feta cheese but is an incredibly creative and refreshing palate cleanser. The meal was exemplary across the board, and the execution of the food at Quince felt straightforward: perhaps the food has some biases towards Italian cuisine, but it feels like you're dining at a uniquely American restaurant - and it does a great job of doing so without pretension.

Updated review
Wow wow wow. I wrote awhile ago when I visited Quince for my birthday about how they had forgotten that we were celebrating an occasion. Matt, the GM there, reached out and invited us back for a celebratory champagne and dessert, and the SO and I were happy to go.Our experience far surpassed any expectations we had for the evening. Matt, Greg, and the rest of the team took amazing care of us throughout the night, and we were consistently blown away by how professional and how outstanding the quality of service was. The SO and I have been to a number of fine dining restaurants in the city; for most of this city, fine dining service is usually acceptable, sometimes awkward. I can say without a doubt though, that Quince's service is the best I've ever had -- the attention to detail throughout the entire meal, the efforts and lengths they went to to make up for a very minor mishap during our first meal, really exemplify what it means to have truly spectacular service and what it's like to make your patrons feel really special throughout their meal. Everyone was easy to talk to and fun to interact with. This entire experience might have been the peak of what I'll ever experience in service in fine dining. We were treated to an abridged version of their menu and given an absolutely gorgeous cake as well as some other goodies. This whole make up experience truly exceeded anything I could have expected, and I'm excited to come back and try out future dishes. Quince is truly a special, spectacular space. The food is of an extremely high caliber, and the service is the most exceptional I've had even relative to some of the triple stars in the city. To Tusk, Matt, Greg, and the rest of your team, bravo. Quince, and particularly the people, are truly special in this city.

Atmosphere:- beautiful decor and art; they partner with local galleries- service was attentive and our main guy was friendly and gave some interesting history of the restaurant (he had been there for at least 7 years)- we were seated opposite the front door and felt a chill every time the door opened, which was pretty distracting and not very comfortableFood:- we had the option of two menus, the "winter menu" and "quince menu." The winter menu has less dishes but bigger portions, so whatever menu you order, you will leave feeling full.- you have the option to add a caviar supplement on the menu, and they verbally asked us if we wanted more truffles too, though it wasn't clear if that would incur a supplement as well- a selection of truffley bites were served in a wooden box rimmed with moss, over a tablet running a video of truffle-sniffing dogs. That was one of quite a few interesting platings- food tasted good but heavy on the whole, with a lot of similar flavor profiles - there were too many truffle and pasta courses which made the meal feel too heavy and one-note. We would have liked some crudo to break it up- one salad that was served under offals finished tableside gave the meal a punch of freshness and acidity- the mignardises cart was pretty and stays on display in the hallwayDrinks:- the wines recommended were interesting and unique.- the lemon sage non-alcoholic drink is amazing. The pro provencal, not so much, so they brought me an ad hoc orange chamomile which was kind of bland and not effervescent. They kindly offered to switch it again but i kept it because I felt bad.End of the Night:- they give you menus to take home and a box of mignardises that they think you will like based on what you ordered off the cart- they gave us hot cocoa, which tasted just okay but was a nice thought- the valet bill ($18) is added to the check and they pull the car around for you as you leave.Overall:A lovely dinner, but not my favorite for the price we paid. The food is delicious but overly rich and one note in flavors. My advice would be to just get the seasonal/smaller menu.

Service: amazing. Milton was great! So attentive and sweetFood: they only have a tasting menu and it was delicious. Highlights were the caviar dish, trout, and lasagnetta. Dessert wasn't the best - way too sweet. Other than that, it was a great meal. Although great experience and food, I probably wouldn't come back a second time for that amount of money.Drinks: we had the wine pairing which was great. We also ordered one of their cocktails that had gold leaf in it and it was a very entertaining drink!

We were in SF for a convention and decided to try Quince. Luckily, we were able to have an opening for Thursday night. Quince has two menu options, the Indian Summer Menu for $165 with an optional $150 wine pairing, and the Quince Menu at $220 with an optional $180 wine pairing. The food was amazing, delicious and unique in a way. The presentation of the dishes were astonishing. Service was amazing. We would definitely come back.

While I very much enjoy Gary Danko and Michael Minna, I was very much impressed with my recent dinner at Quine, a first time experience for me.I came as no surprise that the food would be wonderful since Michelin had recently awarded owner/chef Michael Tusk his third star, the only S. F. eatery to be so awarded a third star in 2017. What made the experience so great was the ambience of the evening.The dining rooms are beautiful. Lindsay Tusk, Michael's wife, has created a space that sets the scene for a truly memorable evening. Unlike most high end restaurants, Quince is very quiet. I found it so much nicer to be able to carry on a conversation with my dining companions.I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Service is professional without being stiff. I loved hearing the details of each dish, from the manner of preparation to the sourcing of produce from a local farm.

How romantic of a place is this! I had both the Quince menu and garden menu. Free sample nibblers- what a nice touch after sitting down.- Caviar- get the upgrade, it taste much better and it comes with bread for the rest of the items on the dish. - Tomatos with Uni and a sorbet on top- I didn't think I would like it but I ended up loving it! It's a mix between a salad and a sweet dessert with a asian touch.- Abalone with mushroom- well prepared and the reduction sauce was a perfect paring.***** Then.....in the middle of it all..... the chef invited us for a tour in the back with cocktails! What?! The vodka ice cocktail was delishhhhhh! I want 5 more!- Pasta dish with eggs and carbon shavings- rich and heavy but not too heavy, just the way I like it.- pork 2 ways- lovely crispy skin, and full of flavor.- Square fish with squid ink- yum! firm and buttery with a touch of squid ink.- Meat dish- I think it was deer or pig or something. 2 slices with veggie garnishes and a nice sauce.- Bowl of foam- very modern- chocolate pan-cotta on a cake- not my favorite but it was ok.- Chocolate dome dessert- Can't remember the taste of it.- strawberry roll- now this was very very memorable and very delicious. the sauce was very sweet and delicate.Then the dessert cart!The caramel was my favorite.Followed by the marshmallows. I would pass on the white nougat one. Overall, everything was delicious!!! Not a single bad dish (very rare). I had 2 cocktails and 1 wine pairing. The total for 2 was close to $1,200. I will be back! So romantic and the staff was a joy.

I had been dying to dine here for the longest time. The hubby made reservations here for my birthday even though he absolutely hates tasting to a degree that is almost stupid. How can anyone hate eating little bites of heaven lol. The attention to detail was truly amazing from every garnish to the plating of each dish. This meal was truly magnificent and I was a little sick at the time but I could still taste the divine flavor profiles of everything. Hats off to chef tusk!!! Then there's impressive wine list and the spectacular dessert cart. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere and ambience is gorgeous. I do however have to say this was a particularly expensive meal. It's not often you end up with a $700 bill for two but it was worth every penny!!! Can't wait to return :)

Took my wife to celebrate her 4Dth (yes, she lives in another dimension!) birthday. From the beginning to the end, it was just such a perfect (and unexpected) experience.We found them not to be at all pretentious and totally engaging. In a lot of ways it was like being with familiar folks from the beginning. We were super comfortable around the amazing staff.They were totally respectful of my pickiness. I don't eat seafood. I also mentioned that my wife loves German chocolate cake and they made her a small one for dessert too.My wife went big (right side of the menu with the wine pairing.). She upgraded to a caviar feature. Not only was the dinner a nice journey, but you could just tell how passionate the kitchen was about making sure people love it. They sent out an extra plate to make sure my wife got to try something she didn't order.Before dessert we took a tour of the place including the kitchen and being able to chat with a chef. Again, these people are just so nice and completely passionate about their art.My wife didn't love one course and they saw she didn't eat much of it so they apologized profusely and made another special dessert plate. My wife looked at me and said "this is possibly, probably... IS the best dessert I've ever had."I'm not a truffle nut by any means, but they just found such a wonderful way to make truffle a big part of the experience, but without just adding more cowbell (if you know what I mean).Even as we left, they had hot chocolate waiting for us. We left our menus on the table and they e-mailed me to say they'd send it to our house.I'm just such a fan of their food, their people and the experience. Well deserved 3 stars. Had to rank it above Manressa and way above Joel Robuchon LV (our last couple comparisons). Reminded us of the fun we had at Meadowood a bit ago.

Make sure you have a reservation and prepare to be spoiled. We had the chefs tasting menu along with the suggested wine pairings. Absolutely insane night of flavors and treats. It is expensive. About $400/head for both meal and wine before tip. But for sure next time I'm in San Fran I will return. The service is top notch. Extremely knowledgeable staff. The bar in front of the restaurant is something too that you don't want to leave quickly. Very comfortable and great atmosphere.

Attended the Michelin all-star dinner last Sunday and had a wonderful evening with a dear friend. The service was spectacular and I would say was one of the biggest highlights of the evening. They were very kind and knowledgeable about each dish and all the wines that were being poured throughout the evening. The other stars of the evening were definitely Mourad's Beef- Ras el hanout, bone marrow and veggies and Quince's Tortellini- Porcini mushrooms, black truffle. I love their black truffle pasta so much that I even attended their Truffle dinner a while back. Mourad was very kind and as I have seen him do a couple times at Mourad, even came out to chat with us all. Fantastic evening!

Updated review
I've written several reviews of Quince, both here and on OpenTable in the past year. These reviews pretty much all said the same thing: the meals at Quince rank among the best I've had in my life. They're fun, they're delicious, they're well-made.However, it turns out that Michelin has belatedly realized this as well, and recently gave Quince its 3rd star. Yes, it's deserved - but now it's noticeably more difficult to get reservations. My schedule is sufficiently hectic that this makes it distinctly more difficult to go. So I have somewhat mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, it's nice to see recognition for good work, on the other hand, it was also nice knowing that I'd found a somewhat underappreciated world class restaurant right in my backyard. Now the secret's out I guess.My most recent meal there was actually in November, soon after their third star. Like any Quince meal, it comprised a terrific assortment of courses. Several of the courses were so spectacular I can still taste them like it was yesterday.My favorite course was a pasta dish with white truffles and fontina. I make a lot of homemade pasta myself and very few restaurants can compete with good homemade pasta; this was really good. There was a strong truffle taste to it too - most local restaurants that say they add truffles to thing add so few it's hard to taste the truffles. Quince put quite a bit on there. Anyway, it was a rich, complex flavor, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had, I'd say.Another simple but remarkable dish is one that I doubt readers will even believe can be as good as I describe: a simple pain d'epi. Quince always has wonderful breads, easily the best of any restaurant I've been to, but even for them this simple piece of bread, looking like typical baguette, was just amazing. Delicate, crisp but firm crust; airy, flavorful interior.Other highlights were a wonderful and complex venison dish. Grilled venison is served alongside a separately prepared skewer of venison, served over charcoal at the table. So good! I also had a terrific squab dish. I'm actually not a wine expert, but even I could appreciate a smooth and delicious 1996 Bordeaux (Chateau Lannesan), served out of an Imperial (6 liter) bottle.I was also a bit amazed, even after all my meals there, at how accommodating and helpful Quince is. I am definitely a challenging customer, with all kinds of dietary restrictions. Most restaurants, even great restaurants, respond by just leaving out some ingredients or making some simple dish. Quince actually made me several fairly complicated and excellent dishes that weren't even on the menu (foie gras for instance). Not only was the food great, but I was kind of dumbstruck by how hard they were willing to work to give me and my companion a memorable meal.Like I said in my previous review, there are so many courses - something like 18 dishes, depending on how you're counting - that it's inevitable that not all of them will be as great. My favorites were the truffle pasta, the venison, the foie gras, porcini tortelli, the pain d'epi and the wine (although I also liked the amuse bouches). But the pithivier was not quite as good as other desserts I've had there. Or maybe I was just stuffed by that point.

My husband took me here after he proposed to me, and Quince made sure they made our special night extra special -starting with a customized menu with our names on it.We had a ten course meal with wine pairing. The food was impeccable! Well proportioned and tastes sophisticated, not overwhelming. The only thing missing is that they don't have cheese plates, but who needs cheese plates when everything else is perfecto. It's one of the best dining experience I have had (if not the best), but we are probably not gonna come back anytime soon as although the $$$$ was worth it, it's not worth coming back considering the significant amount of excellent restaurants available in SF.
