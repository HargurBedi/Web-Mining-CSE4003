The Tuscan chicken was really solid. Loved the capers, sundried tomatoes, garlic, and polentaThere is a $15 cork fee FYIWe came in at 6:30 on a Friday no problem or wait. Staff was friendly.Can't say it's my absolute favorite spot but can understand why tourists staying in the area might check it out

Ordered through Eat24...Wish I could give Eat24 1 star for this instead of docking a star but what choice do I have? It took over an hour to get my entree credited back to my card after I finally took matters into my own hands and called the restaurant myself. I spoke with the manager Alex-- it was a strange interaction as I asked for the manager, he said he was it but when asked his name he was hesitant to provide it...what kinda manager does that? You're leading by example (I would hope) and hiding your identity from customers calling the restaurant is weird. Maybe he wasn't the real manager but he did take care of me, so thanks, Alex. The food was luke warm upon arrival and the chicken was literally rubber. I had my girlfriend try it and she couldn't even recognize it as chicken! It was cut into 4-5 pieces and while it smelled good, the texture was horrifying. The $12 salad is really a glorified side. Very disappointing. 3 stars for the pasta, 2 stars for the salad, -1 star for Eat24 customer service, 1 star for the chicken since the potatoes and veggies were edible. Will revise my review if I decide to dine in but the delivery is not recommended.

Totally agree with getting the window seat!Not just for the entertaining views but to have some air to breathe. Tables are extremely close together and there was only air from the one open window. Cooled us as well as our food.I had eggplant parmigiana. There was a slab of mozzarella on top of the eggplant that was barely melted so I easily removed it. The only sauce on the eggplant was right under the mozzarella cheese. There was a layer of sauce, fried eggplant, ricotta cheese, a slice of tomato then another layer of the same. Not a good representation of eggplant parmigiana... my favorite.Would not recommend this restaurant for good Italian food.

I was staying just down the street and looking for Italian and noticed Cesario's. Enjoyed my meal very much - don't get the negative comments. Bitter Yelpers, I assume. Not me. The only criticism is that since it is a very intimate (small) space you are definitely sitting right on top of others. But the atmosphere is nice, the servers great and attentive and the food all wonderful. I enjoyed a starter salad, special lobster ravioli, house red wine and capped it off with tiramisu and porto. I would recommend it as a nice neighborhood place that is all class. If you are looking for a large space, perhaps not for you.

This place is surprisingly good. It was very close to where we were staying so we stopped by Cesario's for the convenience. We had walked by before and noticed it got pretty busy during dinner time.The portions are pretty big and the pastas here are delicious. We tried the bruschetta and it was good, not the best though. It's a really small restaurant and the tables are real close to each other so be prepared to be intimate with the other parties. What I liked the most was the food was fresh. Our dish came out piping hot, just the way I like it.

It's definitely not the worst place I've ever eaten but I definitely won't be eating at this place again. The service was slow with only 2 other people in the restaurant and the food was just not at the level I expected from a place that serves "fine Italian food". Everything is overpriced so be prepared to be more for less. They had very fresh bread though!

I hadn't been feeling well and didn't feel like 'going' anywhere, so we visited this place, which was adjacent to our hotel (Marines Memorial). I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food! The only significant drawback was the cramped space - as someone who mostly eats out in Manhattan, that's really saying something!

Writing this in the hopes that management will read it. I asked the waitress if my dish was vegetarian since I am a strict vegetarian and always like to double check. She assured me that the dish I chose was vegetarian. I had a tasty dish, nothing super special, but when I started into the last third of it I saw what looked like a piece of meat. I had my boyfriend try it and he said it was unmistakably bacon. I lost my appetite but sucked it up and ate a couple more bites in order to try to not to be wasteful. When I informed the waitress of the kitchen's mistake, she apologized but brought us the check for the full amount. I was surprised because, though this doesn't happen often, whenever I've been in a similar situation at another restaurant, they have always gone above and beyond to make things right. Even in cases when something is slightly off, the restaurant will usually offer something to make up for the customer's displeasure. For example, a month ago I went to one of the other Italian spots I frequent in this neighborhood and noticed that the sauce on my pasta was different from the previous time I'd gotten it (there was a new chef and he/she didn't make it quite as well). They not only gave me a replacement entree at no additional charge, but to my delight also gave us a free dessert. I had only asked if the sauce had changed and had not even made a complaint nor expected any reparations, but the restaurant still made sure we were fully satisfied. I was very disappointed when I received the check for the full amount. I then asked the waitress to remove the charge for my entree, upon which she looked surprised and turned to the manager, who questioned the legitimacy of my claim and then proceeded to begrudgingly offer a 10 percent discount. To management: I live just a couple blocks from the restaurant and could have become a frequent diner. Imagine if you found something you find unappetizing in your food that you specifically asked not to have. Even if others might enjoy it, it really ruins your dining experience, regardless of whether you find it at the beginning or the end of the meal.

Oh my goodness. This place is a real gem. The food here was amazing and the service was delightful. We started with the Pear Salad which was amazing. Definitely try it if you haven't already. The walnuts really make it. Then we ordered the linguine carbonara and I totally forgot the name of the other dish but if you show them the picture I'm sure they'll know. The linguine was delicious. Perfectly creamy with a nice amount of diced bacon and peas. The noodles were textured perfectly and it was so filling I could only eat half. The plates are huge so I didn't realize how much food there really was. The other dish was tasty as well. Not so creamy but definitely had a nice smoky flavor which went perfect with the light tomato sauce. I paired my linguine with the house Pinot Grigio and it was divine. I'll definitely be returning.

We ended up going here on July 4 because most other things were closed in the area. It is a popular little place right on Nob Hill as you walk up the hill from Union Square. There was a line and the owner asked us to wait next door at the hotel lobby. It was about a 20 min wait. A small and intimate place with good Italian food and friendly service. The owner recommended a nice bottle of red wine to accompany our meals. Our party had the conchiglie (sea shell pasta) with smoked salmon, the frutti di mare with linguine special (this is my go to dish when it's offered), the chicken marsala and the ravioli florentina. You know it must be good because some of the specials had run out. Everything was made well and delicious, and presentation was top notch. As they say, you eat with your eyes first! Enjoyed our evening out. Even as we left there was a wait to be seated. Very good food and service. Definitely recommend going if you're in the area, it'sa little gem!

Cesarios was very close to my hotel room, so the location was vefy convenient. I ordered the calamari as my main dish, knowing I would not be too hungry after that, and then had the Tiramisu as my dessert. Both were equally as tasty. The calamari was fried and crunchy, the sauce was more of a neutral tomato based sauce. I regret not ordering a pasta as well, I think it would have been great. The tiramisu was so fluffy and a huge size, so I was impressed. My only pet peeve is that they put it on a strawberry filling which I don't think goes well with a tiramisu, but it's small enough to look past.

Worst service EVER. I've been here once before and it was alright. I decided to take my mom here on a Sunday when the restaurant was absolutely dead-- literally, it was just my mom and I and one other couple. We waited AN HOUR for our food. I finally asked the waitress to check on it because I knew it shouldn't be taking that long if no one was in the restaurant. Turns out the owner (I think he's the owner) didn't even put our order in the system. When he learned of the mistake he wasn't even apologetic. We got up and left. Never coming here again.

I get it we changed our reservations to 7 but the thing is my parents, sister and i were waiting outside for our god damn table for at least an hour. The manager had the fucking decency to tell the customers to hurry up because there were people that were waiting for their table. I really like this restaurant but the guy didn't do shit. He was just standing there looking around. The custmores on the other hand were done with their food, only their waters were on the table. I swear to god if next time this happens again i will go inside and do something about it. We were there to celebrate our mom's birthday. I am just so angry. If my mom didn't keep telling me not to go in there and if we weren't there for her birthday i would have gone inside and gave guy a piece of my mind. The fact that he didn't tell the customers that we were waiting pisses me off even more. I work in a restaurant too, i get it, it gets busy but if there were custmores who were taking a long time and someone else needed the table i would go up to them and tell them in a nice way "hey guys there are customers who have been waiting for a table for a long time do you think you can hurry up, they need it". I would have the decency to do that. But it just pisses me off so bad. I haven't gone to this restaurant in so long, i work practically every day managing the restaurant when my boss is not there, i don't get the time to spend that much with my family and i was really looking forward to it tonight.

Cesario's is a solid option for a good, satisfying meal. The ambience is great, service is excellent, the portions are the right size, and the pricing was within expectation for the portion sizes. For vegetarians: this place has excellent vegetarian options. It has a large number of vegetarian pasta selections, a large number of vegetarian appetizers, and a few vegetarian entrees. I ordered a fettuccine with pesto, and requested that mushrooms be added on top (and they had no problem accommodating that request). The pasta was absolutely delicious - really well made. In addition, I found the risotto that I ordered to be excellent as well. Service was fantastic as well - really courteous throughout. I'd note though that the seating is very close together (this doesn't affect me, but it might be bothersome for some)Note: I would call this more of a low $$$ than a $$ restaurant - expect to spend about $40-50 in all if ordering an appetizer/dessert, an entree/pasta, and wine.

Cesario's was not too far from my hotel so I decided to stop-by for a late lunch. The dinning room is not too big, the tables pretty close of each other, but at the time I went there was only 4 other patrons so I didn't mind too much. I really like the old school decor of the place. You can tell the place has been open for a long time and has a soul with a mix and match type of decor. The waitress was very nice and provided good suggestions for the menu. I ordered their Ceasar salad for appetizer and it was a massive dish! Well made, flavorful. Then for main I had the Fettucine Carbonara. Again a very generous portion with a lot of bacon, green peas and cheese. I could not finish both plates. Also good mention to their sliced bread served with pesto tapenade and olive oil.

Saw 4.5 review and were nearby, so we came in. Big mistake. A delightful, kind and cheerful waitress could not make up for 'Wonderbread' bread - soft, pure white and tasteless. We almost got up and left after the bread was served, and should have. Carpaccio was five times too thick, 'special' Gnocchi with truffles had no visible or detectable flavor of truffles. Eggplant parm. was flavorless and smothered in cheese. Mediocre at best. Accurate rating would be 2.8. - 3.3. Mostly bottom shelf wines to choose from, too. Overall, a Denny's version of Italian.

The lamb was the meat off a lamb shank, but without the bone. Delicious! Roasted potatoes and carrots in a sauce complimented the meat perfectly! My wife said the lasagna was just like the old Italian restaurants in North Beach she remembered as a kid. The prices are also very reasonable, considering the location of this place.

I really liked this place. The food was delicious. We were lucky enough to get a window booth. The owner was very sweet and friendly. The wait staff was a little cold, but it didn't ruin our dinner. They were just doing their job, nothing more, nothing less. The interior tables seemed a bit cramped, so I was relieved. We made reservations for 8PM on a Monday night and they were slammed.We started with the calamari and it was good. It was what we expected. Good, but nothing to knock my socks off. It was the same calamari you'd get anywhere. We also shared the pear salad and it was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend it. Our main courses were really good too. I had veal and my husband had fettuccine. It was more than enough food. Then we had dessert. Any decent Italian restaurant has to have a good cannoli and this was no exception. It was exceptional. We left extremely full of amazing food. The service could have been a touch friendlier, but overall, it was a good experience.

I ate here with my co workers on our first night in the city. We had landed in the afternoon and wanted some quick and easy Italian sit down food. I ordered some bow tie pesto pasta with chicken (see pic) and it was exactly like what my 3 star rating says, "A-Ok". The chicken was overcooked and a little dry but the pesto and pasta were delicious. No one else in my group was blown away by their dishes either....all just seemed pretty average. The prices were fine....pasta dishes were $15-$20. I would not return or recommend the restaurant to anyone, with a city this big I'm sure there are plenty of other Italian restaurants that have better food for the price, we were just in a rush and wanted something close by! Service was fine though.

Wife and I decided to spend news years day in Union Square. While wondering around after a few drinks at Bobs bar we were looking for somewhere to have dinner. We found the place right next to the Marine memorial club. It was Cesarios. At about 4 or so there was only two people in there but we decided to look at the menu anyhow. It looked promising. So we went in. I had the baked halibut and the wife had the chicken Marsala. I was very happy with both the taste and the portion size of my entree. The wife liked hers as well. The bread wasn't sourdough but was more like a Portuguese sweet bread. The dipping sauce was pesto in olive oil. It wasn't what I expected but was very good. We both had dessert. So 2 entrees, 2 cocktails, 2 desserts and coffee with tax came to less than $85. I though that was pretty reasonable for Union Square on new years day. I would definitely go back if we ever stay in that area again. We then went up the street to another bar and on the way back to our own hotel we looked in and every table was full.

My dad ordered well done, it came out medium. No flavor in the Demi glaze. Basil with olive oil for bread dipping was mehh also, it could use some salt. (I'm not the type to like salty things either). Oh yeah bread was a burned too. Like literally it was bitter. I didn't ask how everyone else's food. But no one finished their meal. So yeah I guess there you go. Friendly staff though! The place is small and cozy. Loved the atmosphere. Maybe I should've gotten pasta. Uhhh the regrets.

This place happened to be down the street from where we were staying. After having a long day of travel, we wanted to stay near by and after looking for something close by, this popped up. We were seated right away since we had made reservations on Opentable. The staff was very polite and attentive We ordered the Herbed Garlic and Parmesan Bread to start- it was very very good. We order the Butternut Squash Gnocchi and the Capellini Pomodoro. Everything was very simple but still made very well. We ordered the Spumoni Gelato and that was well worth it. We enjoyed the quaint little place, service, and food overall. A great option that was close by.

Food is very decent and surprisingly delicious. Perfect place for a quick lunch when you're in this part of downtown.

What a delightful small restaurant. Personable service, fresh food, good portions. My husband had the lamb shank and I had spaghetti and meatballs. We shared tiramisu for dessert. The restaurant was full when we arrived and we started at a small table at the very back. When another table opened up, they offered to move us to the other table which was by the window and great for people watching.

I had not been here in a while. Marines memorial was closed on 12th floor so I had to come down here for a business lunch at 12:30. The place was clean, we were seated promptly and the waiter was observant that it was not just lunch but also an important meeting. He was very polite, have us space to conduct business and let us take our time. Did not feel rushed at all. Amazing service the food was great! And the bill was very affordable! I am coming back again and will be looking forward to the same service. Thank you to the wonderful older waiter that allowed me to have a great 2 hour successful meeting. Food was great also, 5 items and coffee we ordered was delicious.

My first time at this cozy little Italian restaurant. Some upgrades could improve the food. The calamari has a lovely flavor. Served with a flavorful tartar sauce and marinara sauce (tomato sauce straight out of the can). I prefer marinara so would have enjoyed more with a good sauce. We had a paella with risotto. Nice flavor but a little dry. My pear salad had tasteless pear and tomato slices. The dressing on the greens had a good flavor but nothing special. The parmesan garlic bread could have used a little more garlic. Overall, I wouldn't return with so many other great places to eat in San Francisco.

Minestrone was bland. The penne bolognese tasted like a weird form of chili with noodles in it. Even the house red wine was gross. Despite being polite I felt like they hated me with serving food like this.

Dined here on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. Went based on the fact that this was the only restaurant within walking distance of our hotel with space on Valentine's Day (we're both big foodies, but had forgotten to make a reservation anywhere) and this place was perfect! Romantic atmosphere, stellar staff, good wine, and great food. Highly recommend the bruschetta and butternut squash ravioli, though everything we ate was delicious. Will come again next time we're in San Francisco!
