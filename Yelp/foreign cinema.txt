The dimly lit patio with the silent movie playing, plus the heat lamps was such a great impression. It really lifted my spirits after a tough work day; it was only until the SECOND our server, David, came to our table where he dropped off water asked how we were and walked away while my boyfriend was mid-sentence into answering him to talk to the larger party sitting beside us that I got a little bit annoyed. I get it. We're young, we didn't want to order any drinks besides water (it's a freaking Wednesday), & when we finally did order, I decided to start myself off with an appetizer. Apparently, this was offensive to David because he asked me three times if I'm sure that's all I wanted, even though I said I would keep a menu & just wanted to try different items on this glorious menu. Our food arrived in a timely manner, my boyfriend got the duck entree which was magnificently cooked and well prepared with brussel sprouts; I got the sirloin appetizer which came with four pieces of chips that looked like ruffles and was just too salty for my taste. I'm still not upset. Because I might've just ordered the wrong thing, no big deal! But then when David finally comes back to ask us how the food is, he gives me an attitude & an "I told you so" face when I jokingly told him that he was right, this appetizer was a bit small. So I order the potato gnocchi, and even that was tough by the look on his face and the negativity in his vibe. When the gnocchi arrived (also very small portion), it was SO salty that we finished all of our water, and didn't even end up finishing it because the salty taste was too strong. Finally, I read yelp reviews about making a reservation online, where there's an option that asks what you're coming in for. I clicked on the Anniversary button, which is what other yelpers have done as well. People who came in for their anniversary dinners received dessert and chocolate writing of "happy anniversary." Instead, we received the bill from a quiet David who didn't even ask if we wanted to see a dessert menu. After reading countless amazing reviews about this place, I drove from San Jose to dine here, even though the only available time was 9:15PM on a Wednesday. I thought it was fate because at least we got a table. What I experienced here, however, was a tip-hungry, crappy server who obviously doesn't treat all guests the same. I have never given less than 20% tip, and my boyfriend left a decent tip since he took me out this year. I don't even think he deserved it because something that I was really looking forward to was simply ruined by an unwelcoming, impatient server who really didn't bother to explain the menu or ask if we had any questions regarding the items. I hope that no one else experiences this kind of dining. Oh & to top it off, I asked for cherry tomatoes on the side and was charged seven dollars for a TINY portion of CHERRY TOMATOES.

Such a beautiful place! A bit overpriced based off food portion and quality overall to be quite honest, but for cocktails and a few dishes that stood out above and beyond - this place has captured a part of my heart (AKA belly.) Bougie as hell, but quite a nice ambiance - this place is huge with a nice open and industrial vibe about it. Outdoor seating provides nice fresh air and sunlight, while indoor provides a more lively atmosphere overall. Service is great, def. on par to the establishment while remaining casual and humble overall.Now let's dig in:(1) Rhubarb pop tart - BOMBB!!! And Honestly the most memorable thing here! WHA?! A freakn pop tart...yes prob one of the best I've ever had! It was an amazing flaky texture, and the rhubarb interior was warm, fresh, and the perfect amount of sweetness.(2) Ahi tuna with taro chips - was fair, but overall a little disappointing. The tuna itself was fresh and tasty. Although the citrus dressing was not my fave and overpowered the tuna in a particular way. The three taro chips honestly look pretty sad and tasted regular, not special in any way.(3) Santa Barbara smoked salmon - was plated beautifully and tasted as good as it looked. The smoked salmon went really well with their house creme fraiche sauce, while the toast and light salad was fresh and unique. My only issue is the egg, boiled well - but really wished it was poached instead - the plate could've used a nice moist touch from a yummy runny egg.(4) Duck confit - this was tastttttyyyyyy and cooked perfectly TENDER. Lightly seasoned so you get all that fatty duck flavor in your mouth! Simple on a bed of salad with house balsamic dressing and poached egg to top it off right.(5) Monterey Calamari A La Plancha - YESSSSSS! One of my faves! The spicy romesco sauce is a little heavy but so damn flavorful. The chickpeas added flavor/texture, the cilantro cut through the heavy sauce with its fresh tone, and the tortilla chips were crunchy and worked with the romesco sauce.(6) The burger - that BUNN SON! The house dutch crunch bun, is something freakn special and pretty much made this damn burger. The meat was standard, hefty, and well seasoned - while the cheddar spread and herb sauce created a beautiful juicy sauce. Side of perfectly crispy fries just made it all that much better.(7) Champagne truffle omelet - a perfectly beautiful omelet, fluffy in all the right ways and just beautifully shaped. The mushrooms, cheese, herbs, and truffle were strong and tasty but honestly this omelet was still missing something. It needed some type of meat/seafood either inside or on the side or on top. I appreciate the simplicity of it, but it was just a little too simple. The side of potatoes and salad were both also just OK, nothing special.(8) Beef sirloin carpaccio - nice and thin, pretty much melts in your mouth! Beef was lightly seasoned while the horseradish creme fraiche sauce brought a nice creamy touch to the meat.(9) Side of bacon - simple standard bacon, tasted pretty much like what I could make at home. No special sauce or seasoning or maple unfortunately, not worth it.Libations:(1) The swizzle - I think this was a huckleberry type of drink, it was good but the after taste was l little odd for me.(2) Serpent's kiss - my faveee! The citrus is super refreshing that I barely tasted the alchy, but def. knew it was there!(3) Rose lemonade - non alcoholic, but pretty damn good. Light, unique, while perfectly sweet and sour at the same time. Fresh lemon slice and a little bubbly creates a nice, crisp finish.

My friend made reservations for 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday night -- we're both big fans of "The Princess Bride" and we were excited to see it while dining. We were taken to a small table in which the screen was obscured and we asked for a table in the main outdoor patio area (the movie is screened onto the side of a building which is painted white). We were sent to the crowded bar to wait (even though there were tables-for-two available), where no one approached us (re: drinks) and where we couldn't get the bartender's attention. Eventually, we were brought to a table outside where we had a nice view of the "screen."The first dish we ordered was, by far, my favorite -- a plate of Point Reyes Oysters. Absolutely delicious! We also ordered the Lavender Goat Cheese (served with Fennel, Bread Crisps and one other thing I cannot remember). It was served hot on a fig leaf and was tasty -- a very small portion, however.We then had the carpaccio which was pretty meh and tasteless. Finally, we had the steak -- I was all for the 5 oz. sirloin, but the waiter thought it would not be enough, so we had the larger steak (I was shocked when I found out this dish alone was $50) which was sliced. It was cooked to order, but the quality (poor) of the meat was shocking -- it was gristly with unappealing chunks of fat. It was not a good cut of meat and was okay at best.We did not order desert.If you are excited at the prospect of actually watching the movie, bear in mind it's really just projected onto the wall. There are very random drive-in theater speakers eeking out so little volume, the film is really just atmospheric. However, if you were on a special date and ordered food you found delicious, I can see why people may find this restaurant appealing.The wait staff was okay. The hostess was pretty enigmatic (and looked like -- and acted -- like Anck-Su-Namun from "The Mummy 2"). I liked our waiter and found him very capable. My friend found him cranky.In conclusion, it was an unremarkable and disappointing experience, save for that plate of oysters. It was also (IMHO) extremely expensive for what it was.

Love Foreign Cinema- what ambiance and awesome to set outside and watch an old time movie with drive in speakers. Definitely need a reservation because the wait times are ridiculous on the weekends. I have been with just my husband and with a large group, so good for both types of parties. Their menu changes quite a bit, but their food is always pretty decent. Also good dessert options as well!

I had high expectation for this place because it's so hard to get a reservation and all the good reviews online. My friends and I went there at 2pm on Sunday. I think this place is kind of overrated. The food is decent. i love the croque madame and french toast. (attached in the picture) They were sooo good. We also ordered a bunch of other stuff. One of them is oyster which i don't recommend. They were small and taste just ok. Overall, the food is good but kind of expensive compared to other places. And the waiting time is not that worth it..

Perhaps my expectations were set too high after hearing so many good things about Foreign Cinema. The food was quite decent and not unreasonably priced, whether a combination of duck confit and poached eggs at brunch or a fairly substantive helping of fried chicken at dinner. The dishes weren't necessarily memorable, though. Similarly, service was decent and professional enough. Like the food, though, it was as if everyone was checking off the boxes instead of really trying to make a good impression. Alas, I suspect it's more about the ambience here. It's definitely a place to see and be seen, whether you're in the glorious outdoor patio with the establishment's eponymous movies being projected overhead, or in the busy dining room. It's certainly a great place for groups, with the enjoyment coming from keeping good company in a lively atmosphere than about the actual meal itself.

Foreign Cinema is one of the first restaurants I visited when I moved to San Francisco years ago. It remains a staple in my life. It's right in the heart of the mission, and the inside of the restaurant is stunning! I love the movies they play on the projector in the courtyard at night. The restaurant is also well known for its brunch for a reason. Breakfast is hands down my favorite meal of the day, and the champagne scrambled eggs are ridiculously savory!!! If you're an egg lover, make sure to order those eggs!!! Although I must say everything on the menu is pretty tasty!

What can I say, this place is iconic - definitely a must try. The food is splendid and worth the price (order the sesame fried chicken - you won't be disappointed!) The only complaint I have is that the restaurant serves a wing with the fried chicken. I mean, this is a fancy restaurant - no one wants to be that person eating with their hands lol. Other than that the service is great and the place is beautiful, just beautiful.Also come here later at night (after 8:30 or so) to catch the movie projected on the walls and to experience the cozy, red-lit, iconic atmosphere.

Foreign Cinema is a beautiful experience from start to finish--that is, after you make it past the sometimes extensive wait. We didn't make reservations for dinner, so we ended up waiting close to an hour as a party of three on a weekday. So it goes in the city.The ambience is a perfect mix of eye-catching contemporary and bay area hip with the films they project in the outside courtyard. If you have the choice, I definitely recommend eating outside in the evenings since it looks romantic with the strung up lights and film in the background.Like everyone tells you, I ordered the sesame fried chicken, an Indian twist on a southern classic with that hint of curry flavor in the breading and the turmeric tasting sauce. The small carmelized carrots they paired it with was a great touch. Before that, we started with a few oysters (fresh and flavorful) and a cocktail (they rotate regularly). Service was nothing short of stellar. They also have a private dining space for events that we walked through while we were checking the place out.This is a definitely a place you should take people if you're celebrating or want to take someone for a special meal. Can't wait to come back!

My friend made the reservation couple of days back so we decided to stop by and have a try; admitting that many dishes are not served during brunch time. First and foremost, make sure you are not missing the entrance, which is clearly cinema door alike. In fact, both my friend and I had missed it on our first try. Once inside, you would walk a long way until you reach the end, leading to a grand space.Hits and misses in terms of food. I loved our beef carpaccio; yet scrambled egg was a bit plain. We also shared a small apricot tart - crispy.

5 stars for dinner, 3 stars for brunchDinner reservations are hard to come by but if you're in luck, then definitely try out the pork chop & fried chicken dishes. Brunch was mediocre, very small portions of food and nothing spectacular on the menu that would make me come back for brunch. We tried the heavenly scramble (a very healthy portion & looks like something I could make at home), Persian flat omelet (Instagram-worthy but very light, you'll be hungry really soon), Croque Madame (super rich, if you're looking for a cheat meal this is it), & the burger (my favorite out of all the brunch options we tried). The Serpent's Kiss cocktail was delicious!Beautiful ambiance, it's very airy & rustic at the same time. I've sat indoors on both visits but it would be nice to dine outdoors on an evening where they show a film in the patio.

Another restaurant I had bookmarked for a while that I was excited to finally try. I love the interior of the place with lots of natural lighting. If you're looking for a place for a dinner date, I highly recommend Foreign Cinema. They play movies outside, which creates a nice ambiance.We came during brunch and ordered a bunch of things to share. We started off with the apricot organic pop tart. I didn't expect much as I don't like pop tarts, but this one was yum! It was thin and flaky. The duck liver pate was good but nothing special. The baby beets in the dish were sweet. I rarely eat beets, but they always remind me of Dwight Schrute... I miss that show. It was love at first sight with the beef sirloin carpaccio. It was a looker. The beef was really thin and served with gaufrette (potato chips). I think the ahi tartare was my favorite, with the grapefruit, avocado, and taro chips. I don't really like toast, but the Firebrand spelt toast that came with the smoked salmon was great. As an entree, we had the champagne omelette. The omelette was fluffy, but a bit salty. I enjoyed the crispy potatoes though. Taste buds satisfied!

Been wanting to come here for a long time because it sounded like a unique experience. Obviously the showing of a film makes it their point of difference but unless you're seated on that side of the restaurant, you won't catch it. Although I didn't expect to watch a film, I did think it would be a nice touch. There were two hostesses. One was all smiles and the other seemed like she was either too good for her job or didn't want to be bothered by guests checking in. She should find another job because you're supposed to make everyone feel welcomed. At least smile and fake it.The food itself was ok. Not bad but not at all memorable. The server was nice and attentive.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my dining experience here.My boyfriend and I ordered the:- Sesame Fried Chicken - Duck Breast and Foie Gras- Grilled CalamariTogether, these three dishes were pretty heavy. Fried Chicken (10/10) - the chicken was not dry at all and had a nice light curry flavor to the breading. This should be shared between two people.Duck Breast (5/10) - i dont think the fig and the sauces went well together, so the dish overall came out to be too full-bodiedGrilled Calamari (10/10) - definitely our favorite dish. The green sauce was really light and paired well with the grill taste. The squid was incredibly soft and not too chewy. Tasted very fresh as well.Ambience - Make a reservation around sunset time and ask for outdoor seating to see the movie and the nice christmas lights.Service (6/10) - Our server in particular was very aloof, and had poor timing. Friendly....but not too aware that night. I had put in a note and called as a reminder that it was a surprise birthday dinner. Then after we were finished with our main entrees, she said "we have a birthday right?" so it wasn't a surprise when the birthday desert and gift came out.

This is one of my favorite dinner spots for parties or taking out of town guests who want good food but not also break their wallets. They always have a good menu with a good variety of choices, the service sometimes could be a hit or miss but the overall atmosphere is definitely good. I would say try to always get seating inside since the middle outside area is slightly windy.I highly recommend making reservations in advance as this place is very popular, otherwise you could be waiting for an hour to be seated.

Foreign CinemaI treated my partner out for his 22nd birthday in June. He's a sucker for not only "Netflix and chill" but for dinner and a movie! What better place can you go for dinner while seeing a movie at the same time (other than home)?! Our reservations were made at 7:30 pm. The movie started after 8:45pm when we were almost done with our food. They change their menus day to day and there's a good selection of seafood, vegetarian, and for meat monsters. Our server explained everything we weren't familiar with so we were grateful for her help. My partner liked his tuna dish more than he did his salmon one. I ordered a Poulet frites! and beef sirloin carpaccio that can be described as a taste that was beaten up to a point that it's so light in your mouth. I'd definitely recommend the dish! My Poulet frites! was the icing on the cake because it successfully gave me a food coma. The fries were crispy and the chicken was delicate and perfectly cooked. The chickpeas were and cooked veggies took it home for me. I was so full my partner had to finish my dish! The movie that we got to see but not really hear was 2013's Gravity. Super cool! You can always check the website to see what their movie list is for the month or two.

This restaurant had a great atmosphere. We did not have a reservation but showed up exactly at 5:30 opening time to get a walk in table. Our whole party was not there so we were asked to sit at the bar until everyone arrived. The food was delicious but more on the pricy side (as was expected). We were sitting inside the restaurant rather than the courtyard (which was disappointing as that's where the movie was playing). However, we knew we didn't make a reservation so we couldn't expect that. The service we received was average. We believe our server was maybe new as there were some questions that could be answered. Overall, a good experience but I would like to try the brunch next time.

Came here last Sunday for dinner with some friends. I made our reservations about a month ago - it gets booked fast! We came an hour early and they were still able to seat us, which was nice. I love the atmosphere here, the high ceilings and windows make it feel very open and not stuffy. We wanted to see "The Princess Bride" which was the movie of the month, but sadly we did not get to see that since I guess they wait until it gets dark to start the movie. (It is projected on the wall outside in the courtyard but is still visible from the indoor seating). Despite missing the movie we still enjoyed our food and drinks. The flavors were on point, and the menu was very diverse and interesting. The drinks were very refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day - we sampled some of the Spritz specials and sparkling wines. I ordered the grilled bavette steak, which was cooked perfectly - I ordered medium rare and that was exactly what I got. Very juicy and tender. It was served on a bed of roasted corn and flanked by two VERY SPICY roasted peppers (I don't know what kind of peppers they were but I don't recommend putting it in your mouth unless you want to die).We also got the fried chicken (great texture and crunch to the breading, interesting Indian-spices and curry flavors), and the seared tuna (flavored with Persian spices, and served with tomatoes). My sister got the Orchiette pasta, which was the only vegetarian entree on the menu. It was very small compared to the other entrees, but it was still delicious.Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you're into a modern vibe and diverse flavors. I don't recommend this place if you're vegetarian as there aren't too many options for you (especially if you're vegan, don't come here). I'll definitely be coming back, and maybe try the brunch next time as I've heard a lot of good things.

I went for a late Sunday lunch around 2pm and was seated immediately (with reservation). The place was really cute and romantic! We were seated outside and it was pretty well shaded for the most part. For starters we got 1/2 dozen oysters (Kumamoto and kusshi, my faves)I got something along the lines of eggs with balsamic. Comes with prosciutto, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes! It was pretty interesting, but yummy! My bf got the croque madame, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Said it was a little heavy tho, but good nonetheless. The table next to us was ordering very specific/custom orders.. like asked for the hamburger but with the steak frites thing? They had run out of hamburger patties so they said they'd do that for her which was really awesome! I'd like to come again for dinner, because I think it'd be pretty with the lights and movie playing.

Updated review
Wonderful ambiance and pretty good food for the most part. I've been to Foreign Cinema twice for dinner, once for brunch and definitely had a better experience dining in the evening here. In my opinion, some of the food here is good - don't get me wrong, but shockingly expensive at times. I guess that is the typical SF restaurant, but it's honestly not enough to wow me.The ambiance is what makes this place really special. There's outdoor seating where movies frequently play up against a wall. The setup is straight from Pinterest, with hanging lights and looks beautiful at sunset. I did take note of the visually pleasing tables and ceramics. This place gets hard to book! Try to get a spot months in advance on OpenTable. In all honesty, the wait and effort needed to eat at this place surprises me. Brunch is easier to book if I recall correctly. I recently came for a team dinner and Foreign Cinema was very accommodating for our big group of around 13 people even though we had a reservation for 10. Props to the server for getting around to everyone's orders, timing when we were all served and handling our multiple appetizer requests. We enjoyed the Warm brandade gratin, Santa Barbara smoked salmon, and Picnic board to start off with. These ran around $16-19. The smoked salmon was very delicious! However, the other appetizers seemed pretty ordinary to me. The "California Features" dinner menu offers all kinds of protein based entrees such as roast chicken, duck breast, steak and seafood risotto for $30~. Portions are noticeably pretty small, but for me it was enough. I noticed that the menu changes pretty frequently based on whats in season which is pretty cool.Petrale Sole - Super delish! I wish I had taken a picture of the menu so I could figure out what the exact ingredients were. Presented with some asparagus and potatoes which were flavored really well. I loved everything about this dish besides the fact that it was a bit on the oily side. Don't think I would come back unless it's for a pretty special occasion. There's definitely dishes that stand out to me, but some others (such as the seafood risotto) I've tried that I feel like I could go to other inexpensive restaurants. This place falls into my bucket of "pay for the ambiance" type restaurants.

A classic San Franciscan experience. I've been to Foreign Cinema numerous times for dinner for date nights, double dates, going away dinners, etc and can safely say that the consistency is unparalleled. The ingredients are extremely fresh, the flavors are well balanced and the meat/fish is cooked to perfection. The ambiance is classic and there are several different rooms/ seating areas each boasting a different vibe (ex: patio, gallery, old hollywood, etc). I've heard that the brunch here is a great experience but I've only been here for dinners. The must-orders on the menu are fried chicken, the acquerello risotto and the five spice duck breast. Also, the house cheese and charcuterie board is a really nice starter to a gluttonous meal. The waiters and waitresses are great with recommending the perfect wine pairings for each dish. They usually have a featured wine of the night served by carafes as well. The only reason I'm docking off a star is because although the quality level of all the dishes is high, there isn't a particular dish that is mind-blowing, inventive and worth writing home about. The dishes are all 4 star goodness, not 5 star explosive goodness. Definitely check out Foreign Cinema on your next trip to the Mission to experience one of San Francisco's classics. Happy Eating, Yelpers!

Two stars for the decor and ambiance of this place - it is, unquestionably, adorable, unique and worth checking out at least once. However, that's where my positive experience comes to a grinding halt.First, the wait at this restaurant is no joke. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT attempt to come here without a reservation. And even then, plan to make said reservations well in advance.Most importantly, I'm wildly confused why vegetarians go nuts for this place. I've only had dinner here, and it was a complete joke in terms of vegetarian options. Not only did the menu lack vegetarian items (fun fact: vegetarians do eat something other than salad) but when asked for an off-the-menu vegetarian item, all I received was a plate of seasonal vegetables. For about $25. And sadly, the desserts aren't anything to write home about.Perhaps the vegetarians are going nuts about their brunch? However, given the price of the food, I'm not sure I'm willing to roll the dice and try it.

I came here last weekend with my family for brunch to celebrate my sister's birthday. My sister's husband had taken her here in the past for dinner and they had such a great time so that's why they selected this restaurant. Parking was surprisingly NOT a nightmare for us, someone pulled out of their street parking spot right in front of us, so it was pretty perfect. The ambiance of this place is awesome. From the outside, it looks like you're about to enter a super dated movie theater. "Wait, is this the right place?" - Normal and acceptable thought process. Then, you walk down a red-carpeted corridor that resembles a movie theater entrance to the host table. Restrooms are to your left before the host table. They seated us inside right away because we had a reservation. Unfortunately it was super hot this morning, even in SF, and they did NOT have the AC on since the windows were open and doors open to the patio. My poor mother complained about the heat several times and was visibly sweating but there was nothing they could do, or so they claimed. The menu isn't incredibly extensive. Seems like a "tapas"-style place since they had a lot of interesting shared plates and only a few main options. We ordered a couple things for the table: smoked salmon on toast and the beef carpaccio. Damn, these were beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Our waitress was really nice and accommodating to my lactose intolerance; she asked about any allergies prior to the meal and made sure any sauce that had dairy came on the side. The smoked salmon on toast is a MUST-have. I ordered the Hummus Wrap with Chicken. I thought this was quite good but I preferred the Shared Items more. A couple of family members ordered the Croque Madame which they loved. My sister ordered the Brandade Gratin which she did not enjoy and since it was her birthday, we told her she should absolutely return it and get something she wants instead. She returned it for another order of the Smoked Salmon on toast. The patio outside looked beautiful, complete with string bulb lights. There's a white brick wall at the back of the patio which is where they play old films during dinnertime. They did NOT comp any dessert for my sister's birthday; we totally assumed they would, so heads up about that! They also brought out the bill and charged us for the meal my sister returned, so we had to have them fix the bill before paying. With your bill, they leave a couple fun postcards with old films, adorned with the name of their restaurant on it, of course. One of them (a postcard with Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell from Gentleman Prefer Blondes) is now hanging as decor in my little work cubicle :) I still enjoyed the food and the ambiance/decor (despite the heat), but seems like maybe this is a better restaurant to come to for dinner. Judging by the quality of the ingredients and the presentation, and the romantic patio with string lights, I'm very intrigued by what this place is like at nighttime for dinner.

I love the vibe at Foreign Cinema--it's different than anywhere else in San Francisco and is definitely memorable. I've now been here twice for dinner and have had two very different experiences which make this review a little hard to write. The first time I came the food was pretty average. We got the charcuterie board which was good, and then a friend and I split the fried chicken and the lamb. Chicken was good, lamb was not something I'd order again. I felt like I spent a lot of money for a very average dinner.My second time the food was on point. I split the pasta, which was delicious, and the fried chicken again which was better than I remembered. We also had very fresh oysters and the waitress made good recommendations. But service was soooo slow. We had a 9pm reservation and didn't get our order in until close to 10. Our waitress was sweet, but impossible to flag down and she'd check in with one half of the table and then leave before asking if anyone else was ready. Everyone's food came out on time except mine which didn't show up for 15 minutes so everyone was finishing up before I started which is definitely avoidable and always kind of a let down. Overall, I think Foreign Cinema is a good option, but not my top choice for the Mission.

If you walk too fast, you might miss the tiny entrance. It's along Mission before you see the line for El Techo.You won't be seated unless your entire party is present. Food, ambiance, atmosphere, service--all of that is gorgeous, flowers and decor beautifully placed...but there were a few things that I would have liked to see done a bit differently. Our hosts were polite and asked us to wait by the side until all five of us arrived. Not a problem. The entrance is fishy-smelling (restrooms or kitchen?) and trippy--like you're going into a dark hallway to watch a movie in the theaters, but you'll end up in a sunny greenhouse-esque airy room to brunch.We ordered the caramel sticky bun (looked like flan) which comes with pecans, and the goat cheese spread with toasted bread to start with. My restrictive diet only lets me eat the latter, which I thought was delicious and a great one-biter to ease the hunger while we waited for our orders. The wait time for the food to actually come to our table was the longest part, other than that...service is laid-back and nice. I had the tequila jalapeno drink to start with, but it was a resounding WHOOT around the table that the Bloody Mary was the big winner. All of the drinks are beautiful--which seems to be the main theme of Foreign Cinema. My truffle omelette seemed to be the big winner around the table as well, SCORE! The omelette is fluffy, soft, and so saliva-inducing, you'll agree that it's the best item to order. It comes with potatoes too, so say yes to the ketchup and aioli when offered. The main attraction to Foreign Cinema is during the evening, when there is a projected movie playing in the outdoor seating area. Come in the evening to wine and dine. It's a nicer spot, where I wouldn't say you HAVE to dress up...but dressIER is a better choice. Everyone in this place looks like they work in retail, or just know where to shop. My suggestions are small: freshen up the entrance and get rid of the flies buzzing around in the indoor seating, and I'll feel a bit more justified about dropping the $$-$$$ worth price to dine here again.

Dinner here was very good. From the food to the ambiance and the waiters, everything was a breathe of fresh air. It's a really nice spot for a romantic dinner, ladies night out or a guys night out. I'd say book a reservation in advance to avoid waiting. According to the waiter, the menu changes every time. I had a seafood dish which was a smaller portion than I had expected but was very delicious. And the portion didn't matter because I was having a 3 course meal anyways. I wasn't as fond of the desserts as I was of the main course and appetizer. They started showing Interstellar right about when we finished dinner - that was when the sun was down. It was a great experience and I'd definitely like to go back with dinner scheduled a little later so I can catch more of the movie.

We are regulars at this spot. They happily accommodate our lil' toddler, and provide crayons for her enjoyment. Always a solid brunch. Eggs, the French toast, pecan roll, you just can't go wrong. Sit in the outdoor patio if you can. Din? Where do I start with the magic this place exudes. Perfect lighting, French movie playing on the patio wall, cocktails, or vino if you choose. Romantical. That's the word, just perfect.

A large group and I came here for my friend's birthday, and we talked for the rest of the evening about how much we regretted it. I would expect poor service from a fast food chain, but never a place with this kind of reputation. Our server took a full 30 minutes to address the table, and when she did we were not greeted, but asked if we "needed anything". It only went downhill from there as we waited unreasonable amounts of time for drinks to be filled, orders to be taken, and checks to be run. All while being talked to like we weren't supposed to be there. In addition to this, the seafood risotto was not worth the money and the music was loud. Thank goodness they have amazing fried chicken or this would have been a total bust. Definitely would not recommend this for large groups, people with personal requests that need a server's attention, or those that cannot hear well.

Definitely a cute spot in the Mission but the wait for a spot outside is much longer even with reservations. The service wasn't that great either. Our waiter did the bare minimum. He said hi, asked what we wanted, was slow and generally did not seem to give a shit about us or his job.The food was pretty good though but overall it's an overrated spot. Much better places around :)

Brought my boyfriend here for date night for dinner. It's super cute in here, you feel like you are in a movie theater! Once you get in there is a red carpet leading you to the restaurant. They have indoor seating and upstairs indoor and also the patio where they play a old time movie with pretty lights hanging above you. My boyfriend and I sat inside near the patio window since it was pretty cold. Service was great and quick.We ordered:Sonoma foie gras en terrine: Delicious, you cannot go wrong with foie gras! Very smooth and creamyBrazilian halibut ceviche: Portion is super small, but flavors went well and fish was fresh, had a kick of spice to it!Sea scallops: Meh, very salty, this was served like a chowder and there was ONLY two sea scallops and then a slice of fish. And there goes $31. I mean if it was good then thats a different story, but it wasn't, not worth the money.Five-spiced duck breast & confit leg: My boyfriend got this and it was SO salty to the point he had to tell the waitress. They brought my bf another one that was less salty and it was better, but I wouldn't say it's the best we ever had or to die for.Overall, not sure if I'll come here again, maybe if its with a group of friends. I feel you pay more for the environment and ambiance.

A good place, high ceiling, bright.There are a lot of seats when we got there, but no idea why they made us waited for 15 mins in the bar.There is mushroom in my omelet, which I don't like. But the other dish was good.A good place worth a try, but I don't think I plan to go back again, nothing impressive to make me go back again.

Went here for a friend's birthday brunch celebration in a group of about 10 people. My friend and I ordered an arugula salad and the "our" burger. Food was pretty solid - no complaints there. The time for the food to come out was relatively long, however. I ordered a rose lemonade which was especially delightful. It was wonderfully aromatic but not overpowering or too sweet.Solid place for brunch, but definitely on the pricier side. I felt my salad at $11 was particularly overpriced when I probably could've gotten a much larger and similar quality salad at Plutos.

Worst restaurant experience ever!!Where to start? I hosted a corporate event here. In short- food is decent (but sub par to SF standards) and the environment is dated for the price. The service is sterile, apathetic, and unbothered. It likely reflects on the experience I had with the owner while disputing a false charge. He was rude and told me my business was not welcome after disputing an error in (group) ordering that was due to a death in the family during the planning period. Despite emailing the restaurant well in advance of the event to notify that a close relative had passed away and I would be OOO; the owner remarked: "stop talking about this death - it has nothing to do with the disputed charge. I have a business to run, and you should spend your time understanding how hard it is to run a restaurant in SF." I am disgusted. I have never been treated with such little respect for humanity in my life. I WOULD NEVER give a dime to this business, even if the food and service were good - BOTH of which were 2/5. Spend your money elsewhere and get better service and food! I travel 250k miles per year and this is by far the worst restaurant experience on Earth.

I just had my birthday dinner at Foreign Cinema, and we all had the best time! Food-wise, we loved everything we ordered: calamari in mole sauce, the curry fried chicken, duck, and scallops. I recommend them all! Yum!It's such a warm and wonderful experience sitting outside having dinner with friends with a movie playing in the background. I picked the restaurant because I love string lights, and I wanted a cozy atmosphere so that I could talk with my friends. Our server Erin was so kind--she really was integral in making us feel welcome and happy :) Thanks so much, Foreign Cinema!!

I came to Foreign Cinema for brunch around 10:30 am and was met with an hour wait that turned out to be 30 minutes. They do take your phone number and call you when you're next up so that makes it really convenient to walk around while you wait. Price: This place is definitely quite expensive but I'd say worth the price for a nice occasion. Each main dish is around $15-$20. When I went, the total bill was ~$50 and we ordered 2 dishes and a sticky bun. Food: Probably one of the best brunches I've been to in the Bay. The duck liver pate was really good and you could ask for more grilled bread if you need it. The peach and arugula salad dressed with balsamic vinegar was a perfect blend of sweet and sour. The pecan sticky bun came warm and not overly sweet as I find most sticky buns can be. Service/Ambiance: I came with a very casual clothes and backpack since I was traveling on public transportation with the intention of staying in SF for the night. That being said, there is definitely a bougie vibe and I felt the waiters gave me a few funny looks since I looked noticeably underdressed. However, other than that, the waiters were, for the most part, friendly and attentive and the ambiance was stunning.

If I could marry a restaurant, I'd pick this one. Well, at least in the mission. I'm assuming my restaurant marriages take part in a polygamous society.I came here for the second time recently with my a friend visiting from the midwest. The service was top-notch (our waitress even took Insta-worthy photos for us) and our meal was phenomenal, despite not being that hungry at all. I ordered the pork chop (medium well) and calamari. The portion of the pork chop looked small but was surprisingly filling and very tender. The sauce for the calamari was soo good. I wanted to lick the plate but decided to stay classy.Speaking of classy, the atmosphere was bea-utiful. With the movie Mary Poppins playing in the back and candle lighting, I mentally bookmarked it as a future nice date spot with boyf. (Did you know that Mary Poppins was made in 1964? #funfact #wtf, I totally thought it was in the 90s. The film always changes, fyi.)Prices also aren't bad at all. I booked in advance bc I'm awesome. You should do the same.

BRUNCH SO HARD MOTHERF$%#'S WANNA FINE ME. Foreign Cinema, hands down, has an awesome brunch that no review can do justice. I made reservations through open table and we arrived a few minutes beforehand. Our table wasn't clear yet, so we waited at the bar and ordered some drinks! I didn't mind waiting honestly because the drinks were great and the interior was beautiful. It wasn't long before our server came to get us and led us into their gorgeous patio. The menu changes depending on what's available since everything is fresh and local, which makes it that much better.Hibiscus swizzle (organic hibiscus liquor, Lo-Fi aperitif sweet vermouth, fresh grapefruit, bitters): This drink was really fragrant, on the perfumy side because the hibiscus and grapefruit were really strong. Serpent's kiss (diplomatic anejo rum, batavia arrack, passionfruit, fresh orange and lime juice): Preferred this drink instead! It was extremely refreshing, but that rum sneaks up on you. Heavenly scramble (squash, corn, shishitos, tomatoes, bagna cauda, breadcrumbs, parmesan): I know. It's just a scramble. But it's not JUST a scramble!!!!!!! I don't know how it is that they make this simple scramble so dam good but everything melts in your mouth.Balsamic fried eggs (roasted garlic fingerling potato hash, summer chicories, sliced San Danielle prosciutto)-the combination of balsamic and prosciutto and garlic potatoes is always good, you cannot go wrong. Baguette French Toast (Balakian farms yellow peaches, brown sugar-butter): this french toast makes me mouth water. Those peaches were so juicy and that brown sugar butter added just enough sweetness without being overbearing. I have yet to come here for dinner but I already can't wait! (I might come back for brunch 10 more times before dinner though tbh).

Probably a great date spot given the cinema theme and romantic decor here. The duck and the tuna are both pretty good but not exceptional. Tuna had too much seasoning on the outside. Duck came out a little bit dry. My favoriate was actually the melted goat cheese with berries.The drinks didn't disappoint. You can get some interesting cocktails here.

Came here for the first time and it was brunch. Didn't have to wait long for our reserved table and they sat us outside. It was a nice day, but there was still a chill in the air, so thank goodness each table had it's own heat lamp.The menu was mouth watering and it was so hard to decide what to get. We shared a pop tart and I never eat the store bought ones, but this version was delicious! The crust was perfectly flaky and buttery. It came with different kinds of fruit and we chose the quince because pear was all sold out. I honestly couldn't tell the difference with the quince, it just tasted so good.Not really a brunch person, but I had the fried balsamic eggs. Of course the eggs were cooked perfectly and the bitter chicories helped balance the richness of the dish. The potato hash was crispy and just the right amount.My cousin ordered the bloody Mary which came highly recommended by friends and she thought it was the best she's ever had.Would love to come back for dinner. It is expensive though and it was strange that such a nice restaurant had a broken door in the bathroom. Hate to mention it, but there were only three stalls and one couldn't be used.

Updated review
*Review Update* Boy, am I glad that I came back for their dinner menu. If you have the opportunity to try the Sesame fried chicken (Madras curry, chickpea hummus, Moroccan carrots, chicory salad, kishmish), I definitely advise you to do so! Generous portion, tender chicken, thick and crispy on the outside. So scrumptious. I appreciated the substantial 'ethnic' flair to this dish. My only wish is that they provided more mash potatoes with it. This evening, I also got to taste the duck breast, which was cooked to perfection. Divine in flavor. I recommend this dinner dish as well, albeit reluctantly, since it was a bit pricey. As always, you'll no doubt adore the stimulating ambiance inside the restaurant, as well as out on their terrace.

Came here for Christmas dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the food.-sesame fried chicken: crispy and moist-ahi tuna: fresh tuna, the flavor was a bit strong, there was a high intensity of sourness but I still enjoyed it-octopus: this was my favorite! Best octopus I've had... so flavorfulAmbiance: 5 stars for Ambiance and service. This is such a unique place. When you walk in, there are 2 dining areas. One is outdoor, with a huge projector playing a silent movie. To the left is is a small, intimate dinning room. It has an art gallery vibe to it, with beautiful artwork displayed throughout the room. There's also another projector in here. Service was amazing from the hostess to our server to the busser. Great place for locals and to bring out of towners. Will definitely be back!

One of the main reasons why I chose this place to eat for dinner is because of relaxing and romantic ambience I felt from looking at the pictures on Yelp. When I got there it was really beautiful to see in person. I love how it looks out of the ordinary on the outside and then when you walk in, it's fancy but not like an overwhelming type of fancy; it's simple and classy. I love how the outdoor patio area has a movie playing and a string of lights hanging above the seating area. I think it was all reserved outside because my boyfriend and I sat inside but it was still very nice inside. I love eating crab so when I saw it on their menu I knew that was going to be my order. They let me know ahead of time that the crab was going to be served chilled. I don't know if it's because I'm used to eating warm crab but, I didn't like the taste of chilled crab.Can't wait to come back!

If you come here for brunch, all you're going to get is the ambiance. 1) The service was rude and while they were quick if we complained about something they would make it seem like it was a big burden2) the "Persian Breakfast" came with barely anything! I don't know what we were paying so much for, the quality was not authentic and the amount of food was not worth the price3) When we complained about the appetizer they still charged us for it, which is usually not restaurant etiquette4) The poached eggs with duck was "meh". Nothing special, and the duck was not all that flavorful.I think it was just a bad day to come maybe, and I had SOME expectation considering the price and prestige of this establishment, but I was extremely disappointed. The concept of watching a movie with dinner is cute, but unfortunately, I came for brunch.

The 5 stars are mostly for the ambiance, really such a cool spot. I have come here for both brunch and dinner. Dinner time was a real treat sitting outside in the courtyard, next to the heat lamps, with an old movie playing in the background. Food and drinks are also really great, but definitely pricey for the portions you are getting. For dinner we had the baked goat cheese, calamari, ahi tuna, steak bavette, and hazelnut tart/cake for dessert. All were great, calamari was particularly good. Also loved the warm bread they give you.

We celebrated our daughter's b'day here and thought it would be a fun experience to do dinner and a movie gourmet style. We dined in the court yard with a foreign film projecting on the big screen. We shared fresh oysters for appetizers - Beau Soleil, Chelsea Gem & Shigoku. Hubby had the grilled kobe bavette, I had the halibut and our daughter had the curry-sesame fried chicken which was an interesting fusion flavor. For dessert, we shared a mousse cake and a yummy chocolate pot de creme. It was fun dining expereince on our first visit here.

Great great ambience ! It really is all about the different "themes" of their dining rooms. We got seating in the modern art gallery type room - although I was really hoping for the outdoor one. We made reservations about a month in advance - since it gets very busy here - despite the large dining areas. The food itself was great. The starter were creative and delicious, the main courses (fried chicken and fish) were good but not blow-my-mind amazing. The dessert (cheesecake) was also solid ! The prices for the dishes ran from $20-$30 which is average for a place like this. The crowd here is definitely more on the dressy/hipster side. We enjoyed people watching here too along with the "so bad its good" movie that they had playing in the room. Overall - it's an interesting experience and I would definitely recommend it to people for the experience. The food itself was 8/10.Parking is a pain in the mission - the restaurant offers $15 valet service. But if you drive around in the side roads, it is possible to find a free parking spot on the street.

Foreign Cinema is a delicious restaurant that is low-key. If you are not looking for something fun, you should go here. It is very chill and there is nothing interesting about it. Online it seem like it was really trendy or something, but apparently that's just because of the pop tarts at brunch. I only heard about this place because my mom's friend told us to go, and it is so-so but the food is good. Small portions.The waitress had very slow service and brought our food before the drinks - a very large faux pas in the restaurant industry. We enjoyed the beef carpaccio and the charcuterie platter to start. I was very disappointed that the charcuterie platter did not have cheese on it. Also, the beef carpaccio was very thin and small. The east oysters were better than the west coast. For our entree, we shared the hanger steak. It was fair. Nothing special about it.I really liked the house lemonade. Delicious. Ambience is quite interesting... Mix of Asian tourists and wealthier Americans. I found the aesthetic to be pleasing, but the environment got a little too loud for me toward the end of the evening. We dined around 8 o'clock, and toward the 9 o'clock mark, it started getting a lot louder.It could've been a lot cooler, they could've had red carpet like a theater throughout the entire restaurant, or at least actually shown a movie before it got dark... Kind of disappointed. I also could've Inc. more movie theater like aspects into the restaurant, but instead they chose to put less effort in. I would never go back here, but the food was OK.

My girlfriend and I came here for our 1 year anniversary. From start to finish the service, experience, and meal was exceptional. After informing our server that it was our anniversary, we were served a complimentary glass of Rose each that was a pleasant surprise to kick off the meal. This happened even before waters were delivered to the table, and we both appreciated the kind gesture.The food was amazing and the wine menu is incredibly extensive. We decided to pick our entrees and ask for a recommendation, which was a smart decision. Without informing the server of my price range, she offered a bottle that was right on target with what I was considering. It was the perfect compliment to our meal. I would highly recommend making a reservation, and be aware that it is a large open space that encourages dialogue. If you want a quiet, private dinner, this place is unfortunately not for you. However, the decor and space is exceptional and is an experience I'd highly recommend.

So I've dined at Foreign Cinema twice now... and each time has just been okay. I didn't write a review the first time since I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong items and also was feeling under the weather that day... thus, decided to try this place again literally a few years later (hey, this place is pricy). After another $100+ on a meal, still not blown away unfortunately...I must say the ambiance is really cool and fun but the food was underwhelming. Food was good, but not amazing for its price. The standouts were the appetizers, and the cornflake fried chicken was subpar. I hated how the breading was mushy and fell off.Maybe I'll come back 3 years from now to give this place another try. I really want to love this place. Third time is the charm, perhaps?

Arrived for dinner on a Sunday evening with a reservation. I think the reservation made all the difference, as it seems a lot of Yelpers noted the long wait time. We actually arrived about 20 minutes early and were seated immediately. The outdoor seating is absolutely adorable and highly recommended. It was great for date night. Although it was a busy night, I didn't feel overwhelmed with noise or packed in like sardines. Service was attentive with just enough space. I appreciated not having to save and reuse silverware for each course. We started with the miyagi oysters. Note that these are served with mignonette, not cocktail sauce, in case you have a preference. The smoked salmon was also a refreshing start to the meal, but I wasn't a fan of the pickles. The pasta was surprisingly light, but filling, and my date seemed to enjoy the seared sea bass. All in all, a good experience. Nice setting to enjoy some company over reasonably priced food in a unique setting.

The ambiance in this place is absolutely fantastic. There's outdoor seating where there is a projector that plays *gasp* foreign movies. Totally mind-blowing I know. As an out-of-towner, a friend recommended this place as her go to place. It did not disappoint as far as extensive wine, cocktail and bourbon list. Staff was very knowledgeable from the hosts, servers, busboys, even the couple that was sitting next to our table had a nice chit chat with us on recommended food. Our friend, ordered her staple the roast chicken which was big as fuck, served mediterranean style with hummus. I wasn't a fan of the flavor combo but I could see how people would like it. My travelling companion got the duck, and wow fuckin delish. I got some vegetarian entree thing, I don't remember the name of it, but it was super savory and delicious. Then we ate a shit load of desserts, chocolate cake and a bread pudding. I think they change up some aspects of their menu quite often so by the time you read this, the items may have changed. Go for the nice space and cocktails. The only reason this wasn't 4 stars was because our server was a bit of a bitch. I don't think she was in the mood to be dealing with tourists who didn't know what they want. I'm in the industry too, smile at the table and then go complain at bev station thanks.

Really cool and classy spot tucked away on Mission Street behind some big steel doors! I came here to support a fundraiser -- good excuse to treat myself! Reservations were all booked up, but never a problem for a barfly! Two stars for the full menu being available at the bar, one star for the service, one star for the atmosphere. Minus a star because Jack is not served here! My bartender, Colleen, was very welcoming, and patiently helped me navigate the menu. The Smoked Salmon hit the spot. Next time I will ask for more chips! Next visit I hope to try the Sesame fried curry chicken, if it's still on the menu.Busy atmosphere, but the vibe was short of noisy. This could be a good place to (impress) invite a friend for some conversation, and good eating.

To me, Foreign Cinema is the type of restaurant I would only come to when I haveout-of-town visitors. The ambiance is great and while the food is good, it becomes a pretty pricey meal and you don't get much.A couple of highlights:- Sea Scallops were cooked well and generous in size- Beef Carpaccio is sliced incredibly thin and is complemented well with horseradishA couple of lowlights:- Grilled vegetables were really basic and completely unmemorable- Pork chop was pretty dry :/

A great place for your taste buds to exercise the many flavors of variety of dishes on the menu. Its pricey, noisy, but yet comfortable. The ambiance of this place is welcoming with its high ceilings and unpretentious decor. The service staff was professional and sincere in recommending any dishes on its menu. The parking sucks, because its in the Mission District of the City, so your better off Ubering it or pay the Valet the parking charge and wait outside in the elements with the other patrons . Regardless, I recommend you come early and avoid the crowds, and if you have enough sense to make reservations, I encourage it. However, if you like experiencing meals with the masses, you'll enjoy this place. Not only for the atmosphere but for the food as well.

*This is one of the few top notch places in SF that takes bookings ahead of time!*I have nothing but great things to say about Foreign Cinema. It is truly a culinary adventure to dine here. I came here for brunch and had the hash. It was well executed and quite flavorful. My friend had the balsamic fried eggs and he really enjoyed them but I thought they were on the salty side. The ambiance is so cute too. They were playing a foreign film projected onto the wall (on silent) when we were there. And I've heard they play some fun popular films at times. Will definitely come back for more!

Make dinner reservations early and sit outside if possible. It gets a little loud inside. I introduced my boyfriend to my family here and it went well: nobody complained. I thought the service and food were great. Except the lemonade. It was too sour.

The smoked salmon appetizer came straight out of heaven. Best I've had in a while. A friend had recommended this place. And so we tried it out for date night. We absolutely loved it. The ambience was really great, the setting and layout of the restaurant was beautiful. Inside and outside wearing. The light outside is spot on. The servers were really patient in answering our questions about the menu, and were timely in bringing out the food. The mixed grilled meat plate was done well as requested. Juicy and very tasty.

I get why people come here for the ambiance! I think the food can be a draw for this place too though! I wouldn't come for drinks. It's cutely lit and subtle date vibes. There are fireplaces. I wish they were on bc it was a cold and rainy night when I went. Servers were great! Prompt and friendly. They weren't masters of the menu though, often fetching their notes when asked about oysters etc. Halibut tartare - the highlight of the night! Get it!!! Super fresh and the light green sauce pairs perfectly. I would say one of the best dishes in SF. Scallops - made the way they're supposed to be made. Accompaniments of the plate made the dish filling (or maybe it was the dozen oysters and halibut tartare we had beforehand...)Friend chicken - what they're known for. The chicken meat is moist and seasoned perfectly. The chicken breading - I didn't find it to be as crunchy as I think it should be. Definitely not southern fried chicken, but a nice rendition. Liked it a lot, but probably wouldn't order this again. I'd say, try it at least once!Fruity granita dessert was disappointing. It tasted syrup-y sweet and not naturally flavored by real fruit sweet. Would not recommend. If you're craving granita, go to Rich Table. Had their house made strawberry infused bourbon. It didn't taste infused...? Seems like bourbon shaken with strawberries. Could have used a leafy flavor accent like basil or mint? Seemed like an amateur cocktail for what $14? Unacceptable. Two things really annoyed me. 1) you can't transfer your bar tab to your table so you have to pay twice. That's inefficient. 2) I made reservations for the movie part of the dining space and that wasn't granted. No reason was given and there were empty seats in that space! Overall, would come back but def not frequently!

I love the vibe at Foreign Cinema. it's different than anywhere else in San Francisco and is definitely memorable. I came here for dinner with a group of friends. The food is decent, the cocktails are fabulous. Love it!

4.5 stars, almost wanted to but couldn't round up to 5 stars.Foreign Cinema has been on my list of places to eat for some time, though I can't remember where I had heard about it initially. My note also said to try the pop tarts here. Since I was finally back in the Bay Area over Thanksgiving, I decided to have Saturday brunch here with some old college roommates.Anticipating a long wait and unable to make a reservation, we decided to show up early before their 11AM opening. One of my friend's and I drove up from San Jose, and ended up arriving very early around 10:15AM. Ultimately, it was not necessary to arrive this early, as people did not start lining up until closer to 10:45AM. Nonetheless, the line was fairly long by the time the restaurant opened at 11AM.Since we were the second group in line, my entire party of four was seated without issue, though we were seated outside (perhaps indoors is for reservations?). There were effective heat lamps in the outdoor courtyard though, so it was still enjoyable. Though it was a cloudy day, we also enjoyed the natural lighting. There is a tarp/plastic roof covering the outdoor seating area too, which proved necessary when it started to rain lightly toward the end of our meal. There is a white wall where movies are projected outside, though no movies were playing during our meal (likely, they play at night for dinner when it's dark).Our waitress was excellent and very friendly. She was attentive and passionate about the restaurant's food, and was eager to answer our questions about the menu. She was also very observant of our table, as were the other employees. It is obvious that the workers have been trained well and instructed to pay attention to offer a higher level of service.Finally, the food was excellent. The portions were actually a bit bigger than I was expecting for a gourmet place like this, and our party of four was satisfied without being stuffed after sharing three appetizers and three entrees. We also ordered a cheesecake to share for dessert, and when there were only three honeycomb crumbles, we asked for one more piece to make dividing up for sharing easier, they gladly accommodated and gave us several more pieces. xD Presentation was actually better for the appetizers than entrees, but flavors overall were tasty. The ingredients used were high quality, and the menu changes daily. Prices were high, but not outrageous, and after tax and tips, each person in our party paid $35 for this meal. We each had things we liked and disliked about the various dishes, but the standouts for us were definitely the quince poptart ("best poptart I've ever had") and the brandade gratin (how they were able to incorporate that much fish and arrive at that texture eluded many of my group). See my photos and captions for details.I highly recommend checking Foreign Cinema out for a very pleasant dining experience! I'm sure dinner here is great too, just more expensive.

My boyfriend and I had an incredible night at foreign cinema! We sat in the patio area, which is covered and has heaters so the rain did not concern us. Once it gets dark out, they play a foreign movie on a large white brick wall in the patio area. It was very romantic and a warm environment. We scoped out the other two rooms while we were there. One of the rooms is set up like a gallery, all white with art on display, while people were eating. I'd definitely recommend that area for a group/business setting.As far as drinks go, we started with cocktails that were great! We then moved onto a bottle of wine. THIS WAS THE BEST PART. The wine menu is incredible (long list of French, Italian, and other foreign wines). Since I'm not as familiar with French wines, I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she immediately got the som on staff to visit my table. The som knew exactly what I was looking for. I've never had such a good wine recommendation. Plus - if you're not looking to buy a bottle, they offer some wines in 500ml carafes! As for the food, we started with shrimp, calamari and crab beignets. If you like your calamari fresh, not fried, this is a must! It had some type of curry sauce that was somewhat spicy but not too spicy for me (I can't handle spice). The beignets were great as well! For our main courses, my boyfriend ordered the seared tuna and I ordered the mahi. The seated tuna was great! So tasty! Unfortunately, I was dissatisfied with the mahi. There was absolutely no flavor and it tasted almost like a raw green vegetable juice. I normally finish my entire plate but I did not finish this. Now onto the dessert. Again, highly recommend the dessert wines! We ordered the strawberry shortcake type dessert (sorry but I forgot the name). It was decent, pretty dry though. Probably wouldn't order it again but I'd recommend checking out the menu. All in all, I highly recommend sitting outside for a romantic night on the town and inside for more of a group/business feel. Foreign Cinema is a MUST if you are into wine!! I would give this place 5 stars on the ambiance, wine selection and som alone. Unfortunately for me, I had to minus one star because I wasn't blown away by the food.

Foreign Cinema is a very trendy restaurant in the Mission with a unique setting--you walk in under an old-timey marquee and down a hallway into what looks like a theater into an elegant, modern dining room (that doesn't, however, remind me much of a cinema). I came with two other people for brunch on a Saturday with a reservation, and we were seated right away.The menu definitely wasn't overwhelming, so we picked out a few things to try/share. First, we had the organic blackberry pop tart--while this dish was decent, I found it just a tad sweet (it was encrusted with a thin layer of sugar crystals), but the crust was nice and flaky and the filling good as well! We then split three items from the main menu: first, we had the smoked salmon, which came with creme fraiche, two slices of thick, hearty toast with egg, and "Tsar Nicoulai paddlefish caviar." Overall, this was a great dish--the salmon had a clean, almost refreshing flavor that went well with the thick creme fraiche, the fennel, and the salty caviar. The toast was also very nice, as it was thick, dense, and crunchy.We also had the balsamic fried egg, which was a fried egg on toast served with a very salty (but tasty) potato hash and prosciutto. This dish was perhaps a little bit more salty than it needed to be, but it definitely had great flavors. Finally, we had the heavenly scramble, which came with butter white beans and sauteed greens--the dish was the complete opposite of the fried egg, as this dish was very light, airy, and uplifting.While the food that we tried at Foreign Cinema was decent (but not overwhelming), I found the portions overall a little bit small and perhaps not the greatest value for brunch. For this reason, I probably won't be in a rush to make a second visit.

This restaurant has two main dining areas. One is outdoors with a lot of heat lamps where a movie is playing from a projector. The other is a large indoor room with high ceilings. The ambience in both are great.Salmon appetizer: two pieces of fresh salmon along with some vegetables. Was alright.Fried chicken: sweet, salty and delicious at the same time and very juicy too. It takes real skill to be able to fry chicken without it getting dried out. The chefs here have mastered that.Scallops: fresh, not many given though, nothing special.People come here for the ambience first, and the food second. The portions are on the rather small side so it's a bit pricey for what you get, I went home very hungry.

I have come to Foreign Cinema once for dinner and twice for brunch. I've never had to wait too long for a table and they offer plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating. Dinner: Madras curry-sesame fried chicken - Amazing! Such a great twist on the classic fried chicken. It practically melts in your mouth. Brunch: Organic Strawberry Poptart- Also very good, just wish there was more fillingChampagne Truffle Omelet: Highly recommend if you want something light and savory.

Okay so this place was easily 5 stars the first time we went. We did another trip to San Fran and the service was awful. Food was delicious, per usual. But the service was so rude and basically got into an argument with my gf. It ruined her night, thus ruined our night. Don't get me wrong, food here is amazing and still one of my favorites. But I'll never come back given how rude the service was....
