I ordered a beef taco with a side of guac, and it was super filling for dinner! The guacamole was amazing and seemed very fresh. I downed my taco in a few seconds, and I think the ensuing heartburn was worth it. There was a huge crowd inside Sunday evening, and a guitar/singer playing in the restaurant. Super fun experience!

Ah, La Taqueria. What else is there to say that others have not? It is absolutely amazing. I always order a super carnes burrito dorado style. The steak is always fresh and they chop it up right in front of you. I recommend ordering chips and salsa with your meal as well. I would skip on the side of avocado for your chips, because it's not guacamole, just chopped up avocado.The lines are usually super long and it can be difficult to find seating, but people use dine pretty quickly and leave, so you should be able to snag a seat! If you need some quick and tasty, definitely visit La Taqueria.

Ay caramba! Burrito here is outta this world!During my SF trip, we met some strangers who told us "you guys need to try the Mission burrito before you leave SF." So we did.Things to note:-Cash only-Line is cray cray, especially on weekends-Seating is limited. Good to have your friend save you a seat while waiting in line!-Wear elastic pantsWe ordered the burrito with carne asada...WOW. Burrito came packed with guac, pinto beans and meat. It was the best burrito I ever had. It blew my mind that I forgot to take a pic of it. I literally had a dream about it that night too (woke up drooling). Must visit in San Francisco!

I have to preface this review by admitting that I am an incorrigible Mexican food snob. As the native San Diegan that I am, I have exacting standards for what constitutes really good Mexican food. I went to La Taqueria on a recent, sunny Saturday afternoon--mistake #1. The place was packed to the gills. I understand that it always is, but a nice Saturday in the Mission wasn't doing us any favors in the line department. I ordered a carnitas burrito especial (aka The Works) dorado style (meaning that the tortilla is grilled on the plancha). The meat was really tender and flavorful without being overly fatty and greasy as so many carnitas are. The other fillings were forgettable and the tortilla was standard at best. My date ordered a steak burrito, and again the meat was clearly good quality, but everything else about it was kind of whatever. I did order a mango agua fresca, which was the highlight of my meal. Overall, if you're from somewhere that doesn't have the luxury of good Mexican food, you're going to love La Taqueria and think I'm insane. For those of us who know what truly great American-Mexican food is, though, this place is pretty overhyped.

TLDR: Place is hella hyped but i don't get itHad a burrito from this place and had 3 bites before saying wth am I eating. It's not bad per say but not a good burrito either. Was soggy and falling apart, with not well flavored asada neither. The line is impossibly long and like idk. just a tourist trap i feel.do yourself a favor and go around the corner to el faralito.

Is there a lot of competition? Yes. Are there ridiculously long lines? You bet. Is it kinda expensive? Definitely. So why is it still 4.5 stars? Because even with the fierce completion, long lines and CASH ONLY expensive options, La Taqueria is just that good. It's definitely one of the best burritos in San Francisco and the surrounding area (no, it's not better than the top places in LA and SD).On weekends, the line wraps around and even though it moves fast, you can easily spend 30minutes or more in it. Seating is tough, too. I wouldn't recommend coming with large groups if you plan on eating there. That being said, I've waited in those lines and even with all the cons, this place is the bomb! Can't say I would go out of my way to go but it is definitely a worthy stop for anyone in the area.

Located on Mission and 25th st this place is in the heart of the action. It's always got a line and seems to always be packed no matter the time of day. DonThings to note: -Cash Only (like most things in the Mission)-Dont just stand around if you see a line, make sure you're in the right one. Some people are waiting to pay, some people are waiting to order, and some people are waiting for their food. Ask and make sure as there isn't exactly an organized system here.-Not a place that's great for groups because seating is not plentiful and hard to find it seems. if you are with a group make sure someone is staking a table while others are ordering.I ordered the super burrito with carnitas, and a diet coke for $16. Honestly I was surprised how expensive it was. If could have saved 3 bucks if I wanted to skip the cheese, sour cream and avocado.How did it fair up? Not amazing.The Burrito didn't have much texture. It was pork, beans, sour cream, and avocado. Where was the lettuce?? Next time I'll give the tacos and chips/salsa a try, they looked more promising.

Sure, the burritos and tacos here are good enough, but "best burrito in America" might be taking things a bit far. A super chorizo burrito (comes with sour cream, beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado) was super tasty, but also super greasy, so much so that the aftertaste lingered for quite a while. Not only are the prices quite super-sized these days, but the lines are often ridiculous here. They wrap around the inside of the venue so that you're hovering over people who are trying to enjoy their meals. I mean, if it feels awkward for me in line, imagine how uncomfortable it must be for those actually sitting there. If anything, you'll have worked up such an appetite by the time you get your food that just about anything will taste good. Maybe that's worth an extra half star or so on the median Yelp rating.It's certainly not bad stuff. If you live nearby and it's a neighborhood staple for you, then that's great. Not sure if it's really worth a special trek to get here, though, except if you want to chase the hype.

It's not cheap, not by any means. Realize that. Get your burrito dorado style. If you order anything basic and you're disappointed, you're to blame for not knowing what to order. Know that dorado style means that the burrito is grilled, and it is not on the menu. Don't look at the board/wall for verification - order it as if you know what you're doing. The burritos do not come with any rice. The basic is meat, beans and cheese. The super comes with sour cream and guacamole. The prices have definitely increased. There's always a line, and it's super busy. Cash only. Be patient. Also get the pina fresca! Not too sweet and super pineapple flavor!

Was in town for a couple days close to this place so decided I had to go. First off, it's Cash only, but there is an ATM in the building you can use while waiting in line if you never have cash like I do. I got the beef burrito. It was amazing. Be sure to add the green hot sauce they have on the tables - it makes it. I also had the chips and salsa and they were kinda awful. Unsalted chips with not great salsa. Stick to the main dishes here. The cons: this place is widely popular and you as a customer will pay for it. Longgg lines (out the door when I went). Took maybe 15 mins to order. Not terrible. But then the wait for the food. It was about 30 minutes of standing room only as people came in and out to grab their food as their number was called. I had no where to be so I was fine with it, but just allow yourself enough time for this. Then if you are lucky enough to grab an open spot, you'll have people hovering over and bumping into you while you eat and they wait for their food. Basically I had a crowd watch as I pretty sloppily slammed the delicious burrito. Also they forgot my chips and I had to wait to get those before I left. It needs reorganized but it's one of those community staples that probably will never change because there's really no need for them to Bc people will still come. Gotta respect that. Anyway, it's great for food. Like really great. Try to go when it's not so packed (I went at 6:30pm on a Sunday), and it would be perfect. All in all, this is a super authentic Mexican place with amazing staff. Go just to say you did.

HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST BURRITOS I'VE EVER HAD. I ordered the carne asada super burrito dorado style (grilled). I believe they recently increased their prices to account for the increase in ingredient prices, so it costed me $13 for the super burrito. It definitely wasn't the cleanest or cheapest burrito, but man was it good. Usually this restaurant comes into conversation with El Farolito being the other in regards to the best burrito in town. However, La Taqueria is like the slightly older more sophisticated brother to El Farolito. It can't stay out as late as its younger brother, El Farolito, but overall its a better establishment. El Farolito will cure you drunchies and the greasiness you desire. I went around a weird time (3-4PM) to La Taqueria, and there was a 25+ person line, so I'm assuming there's always a line. I will say the line is worth it, and I'll be coming back when I visit SF again. Taste: 5/5 Bang for buck: 4/5

This was a disappointing and strange visit. This was our first lunch in SanFran and it was a few blocks from where we were staying.We ordered the Carne Asada burritos and I also ordered a chorizo taco. They have an interesting system of placing your order and then calling out numbers deli style. They said chorizo taco after a few minutes and I said I ordered one, and they said it wasn't mine. Fine. Our burritos came out five minutes later, and still no taco yet that chorizo taco was still waiting there. After another five minutes, they asked what I was waiting for and I said a chorizo taco. He then said oh ok well take this, and I said no way. I asked ten minutes ago if I should take it, you said no, and then want me to take this old one? I asked for a new one to be made and I get a disgusted look. I wasn't even a fan of the chorizo taco, because it comes with a glob of sour cream which was too much. Burrito was nice flavored, but I would never come back.

The burrito war in the Mission is real. I suppose it's like Pat's and Geno's (except both of those are really not that great, sorry PhiIy folks) It took me way too long to come here! My winner is El Faralito. I believe the burritos and meats are more flavorful. BUT I do want to note that La Taqueria is more expensive and therefore use better quality ingredients and its noticeable. That being said, FOOD IS AMAZING. The super burritos are good portion sizes. You are either a rice person or not. TBH, I prefer rice but even without it I didn't miss it. I came on a Thursday night around 8pm and it was packed. My co-worker and I waited a solid 45 minutes. We closed out the restaurant after 9pm. If you want damn good Mexican food, but for a more hefty price. La Taquiera is your place.'If you want larger portion sizes, slightly greasier Mexican party in your mouth. El Faralito is the jam. Like I've said in my other reviews, we are splitting hairs. Go to the one that's closest when you're hangry!!

Super crowded around dinner time but it's worth the trek to the mission for a burrito from here. The order line snakes around the entire interior and out the door. You have to be keeping an eye out for a seat while in line if you plan on eating in.The carne burrito was a perfect blend of ingredients and the salsa available at the tables had a great kick of flavor to add.

This is one of those SF locations that you have to experience at least once in your life, simply because it's iconic and pretty popular. I usually bring friends who aren't from the Bay here, unless they're really into Mexican food, because the food here is somewhat average. It's usually pretty crowded too, but the line moves fairly quick. The price is also average. Also, it's cash only!

With the vast array of taquerias in the mission district it's hard to narrow down the right one to go to. I will start off by saying that there are definitely better ones out there but it's still very good. I went around 3pm on a Saturday and it was crowded! I managed to find a place to sit however. I got the super chicken burrito which I would recommend and the chips and salsa which were also pretty good. The burritos are HUGE. Another note is that this place is cash only - which can kind of be an inconvenience. I would definitely come back here but I'm not sure it's worth the long lines.

This place had been very hyped up to me before my first experience. I had been told by some that it was bar none, the best burrito in the city. Having lived and eaten quite a few burritos in the mission, I guess I had a certain expectation of what constituted a burrito in this neighbourhood. The al pastor was tasty, but it wasn't enough to redeem the whole burrito. The actual burrito itself was small. Might be a little hyperbolic, but it felt like half the size of other mission burritos but cost about 1.5x. There is what feels like a lack of seating, but most busy taqerias suffer from this same issue so I'm not docking any points for that. I guess what I'm saying is that the burrito was just an okay experience and I'd probably try the other shops in the area first.

I came here around 3pm on a Sunday for a late lunch, and I was taken aback by how busy La Taqueria was. But hey, why wouldn't it be busy since its claim to fame is the "Best Burrito in America?" I liked that the turnaround rate for orders was lightning speed, but you have to do the awkward table stalking for the next available seat. As for the "Best Burrito in America," yeah... well, it's way too overhyped. The carne asada had a nice flavor to it when I could taste it, but I could hardly distinguish it from the blandness of the entire burrito. I had to use the green house sauce with every bite to add some type of flavor to it. Furthermore, the burrito is messy as hell (dripping all over the place) because of the refried bean juices.I had the side of chips, pico de gallo, and avocado. I liked the chips. They were crispy and tasted like they were made in-house. The pico de gallo and avocado tasted super fresh as well. The avocado especially tasted made-to-order as if someone had just literally scooped out an avocado and mashed it right then and there. Would have been nice if the pico de gallo and avocado had some salt, however. Since these components were also part of my burrito, they definitely attributed to the overall blandness of it.

My friend is from the Mission, SF area and we were craving burritos, so she put me on to this place. It was my first time, and it smelled so good from the outside. There was a long line to place your order and to pay, it was also lunch time. I ordered a carne asada super burrito which came with rice, beans, cheese, salsa, and avocado. I opted out on the avocado though... Usually I like my burritos with refried beans, but this place only had whole. The burrito was cheap, and even though I ate it later on once me and friend got to the park, it was worth the wait in the line. Whoever is in the area and/or lives by this place, be sure to stop by and check out their food. Almost everyone I know has been to this taqueria and it has never failed them either!

Maybe you're like me, and you read the 538 Burrito Bracket. You scoffed at the method as being totally ridiculous and not rigorous. You knew it was a sham. Then, you were super-proud and vindicated as a Bay Area local to see that yeah, the best burritos are here. You have been eating Bay Area burritos for a long time and have your favorite local hole-in-the-wall. You don't know any Spanish, but you know what all of the meats are. And you have had so many burritos but actually never QUITE got around to La Taqueria. How much better can it be? It's probably just like every other burrito you have had since you live in the land of great burritos.Well, yeah, it really can be that much better. You should really try it.After I got over the excitement that comes with any sated hunger, I ate the rest of my Carne Asada super burrito. A lot of burritos would be fine unrolled and turned into a rice bowl. This burrito was juicy and well-blended throughout into delicious bites through. And although it was on the small side, it wasn't full of filler and well-worth the experience.The others in my group got the chorizo burrito and a quesadilla, both of which also looked delicious. And a lot of people were ordering tacos with a soft corn tortilla and a freshly fried tortilla, so that's gotta be good, too.

Our local go-to restaurant when we are craving really yummy burritos and tacos for the past decade+. Although it's changed with the increase of popularity and now slightly smaller burritos, it is still very very satisfying and their quality hasn't changed. Carnitas and Carne Asada are so good and fresh! Their lengua is always very tender and fresh. The order/ Carne asada or carnitas burritoLengua tacos, only with cilantro and onions If we are want some sweet, a strawberry agua fresca. Oh so good. Usually there is a wait but if you go when they open then it's shorter. If there is a wait, someone takes your order, writes it down, then you continue to pay, and then you get a number for your order. Either grab a seat at a smaller table or long table and enjoy the smells and atmosphere. Sometimes we can see the flats of strawberries being delivered or them cutting it. Or avocados which is really nice to see. As long as the quality stays the same, we will continue to enjoy their food for years to come. Of all the Mexican restaurants out in the city, it's our favorite and to us, is the best. Tip: cash only Tip2: metered parking near by or off street non-metered

I'm not a huge fan of burritos (I prefer rice bowls) but this place has changed my mind. This place is known for their burritos and specifically without rice!When we arrived, there was a line out the door. We waited about 30 minutes to finally place our orders. To be fair, the workers were working really FAST. It was evident but there were just so many customers and orders.I ordered the Super Carne Asada Burrito. It was phenomenal. I was skeptical of the lack of rice but it actually was even better. The burrito is filled with your choice of meat, beans, pico de gallo, as well as guacamole, sour cream, and cheese (which makes it a "super").The tortilla was grilled perfectly! It was crispy yet soft and nothing leaked out of these massive burritos.It was amazing! My only regret is not getting another one but that just means I will be back!

The best burrito of my life, I think. I was depressed halfway through knowing I might not be in San Francisco to experience this burrito again for a while. I got a super burrito with carnitas (no sour cream), and it was just perfect -- the tortilla, the meat, the avocado, the perfect amount of spiciness... I was blown away. If I have any regrets, it's that I didn't also get to try one dorado style -- next time.The chips and salsa were good as well, although next time I'd want to try the guac.

The famous burrito bracket winner is a must try for those visiting SF/local to the bay area (like me). Expect a 30 min wait in line on weekends, and expect a war to get a seat. They mostly have indoor seating, which the line snakes around, and a few bar seats outside in the blazing sun. Plus side to the long wait, is you'll get your food quickly since they prepare food efficiently and quickly. In summary: prepare for a stressful time in order to get their scrumptious foods.The flour tortilla here is amazing, so totally delicious especially when crisped up by oil - ingredients are quality quality quality at La Taqueria. I love the chorizo burrito more than anything else, and don't know how they get that chorizo so good! My order always consists of:-chorizo super burrito with no sour cream ("super" adds on cheese, sour cream, and avo)- pina aqua fresca (so fresh and light!!)- chips + salsa= $15 + tipChips and salsa are an additional cost, but worth it! Especially for chip eaters like me.For those out of towners, the area is a bit grungy.

We were in line outside of the restaurant initially at about 30 minutes before closing on Labor Day but we were able to order and get our food within about 30 minutes. I had the vegetarian taco and the vegetarian burrito. I would order both again. The food seemed really fresh and it was flavorful.

Had a lot of ppl tell us on various uber rides this was the spot to eat Mexican food . The lines were gut busting long and the food took a good 20-25 min to come out . I thought it was a nice large portion but nothing extraordinary outside of your typical Tex mex fare . Generous amounts of guac and sour cream were stuffed into their super quesadilla and then fried crispy on a flattop stove. Seating is very limited so be prepared to stand for many a whiles . I also tried their tamarindo which was overly sweet and didn't taste like it had a lot of fresh pulp in it .

No, no, no! For a few years now, I've passed this spot on Mission street. Always saying 'I want to try that place one day'. There's usually a line on the weekends, so I assumed this meant the food was worth getting. Pulease!Truly it takes a special kind of person to to ruin a taco. But this place did it on an epic scale. Look at the photo of my taco for proof. The tortilla is literally disintegrating! There was no way for me to eat my taco is the usual fashion, without everything inside falling out. To make matters worse, I'd ordered a super vegetarian taco. Which meant that it was supposed to include avocado and cheese along with the salsa and beans. No avocado, a smidge of cheese. Their chips taste like oil, as in way to much used. Whatever tomatoes are used in their salsa are flavorless, I might as well have put water on my overly oiled chips. Now I know to keep on walking when I see this joint on Mission street. Wish I'd known beforehand.

Pretty pricey but very delicious burritos and tacos. My super taco cost almost $7! That's almost enough to get me a Chipotle burrito. That said, it was decent size and fairly filling. We came around 3:30 pm on a Sunday and it was still quite a wait. I don't think I'd come out of the way to return but would mind stopping by again if I'm in the area. I'd also definitely go with the burrito next time.

You can find better pollo asado (La Corneta), and you can find better Al Pastor (because they don't serve it), but you'll be hard pressed to find a more delicious carne asada taco than here at La Taqueria. There's almost always a line out the door during peak hours at this traditional taco spot and for good reason. The flavors are fresh and well seasoned without being overly salty and the tamatillo salsa is aggressively spiced but bursting with awesome acidic punch. Also worth noting is the tacos are MASSIVE. I'm usually a three Taco and chips kinda guy, but here two tacos will do you just find. Part of that is the generous portion of meat, and part of it is the inclusion of beans, which you don't see too often in tacos. It's cash only, so come prepared, and have yourself a wonderful fantastically authentic mouthful of Mexico.

La Taqueria has been on my radar since forever ago, and I'm embarrassed it took me this long to finally try it out.My friend and I came after work on a Thursday around 5:30, and the wait wasn't too bad, maybe just 10-15 minutes. I've never been here before, but my friend said it was the shortest line he's ever seen here, so this seems to be a good time to visit.I wasn't too hungry, but I had to order their carne asada burrito as that's what they're known for. As with other taquerias, you order at the counter and then find a seat and wait for them to call your number. It's not a big restaurant so there isn't a ton of seating, but luckily my friend and I grabbed the last table inside.I was super excited to try my burrito, but a couple bites in I was already kind of disappointed. For one thing, for the price you pay it's actually a pretty small burrito. I've gotten burritos at many other taquerias that were not only cheaper but also bigger. But that can be excused if the burrito itself is bomb. However....this burrito was not. I was okay with the lack of rice in the burrito since that's what La Taqueria is known for, but I did NOT like how wet and soggy it was inside. I found myself having to suck up the extra liquid from the burrito on multiple occasions because it was getting to be too much.I'm glad I finally got to try this place out once, but I don't think I'll be back.

Amazing tacos and you pay the price for them $$$$!We pay $7 for a taco when in Georgia they are $2.50. However, we do have to admit these are better. The place is ONLY CASH and seating is limited. Bathrooms are dirty and need some serious attention.

What can I say that hasn't already been said before? I consider myself to be picky when it comes to mexican food being that I was raised on it and to me it's "just food"... I worried that maybe this place was just living off its hype but let me assure you that's not the case here.. I have come here day and night and each time it's always packed and for good reason.. the line moves quickly as they are always staffed appropriately. We have always managed to find parking although it is the Mission so it can get crazy.. I wish this last trip I wouldn't have been so sick because I ambitiously ordered 2 super tacos and I could barely scarf it down. Yes they are $7 which is pricey but well worth it. Thankfully my babe was more than willing to help me out. I don't care who you are, if you have been sheltered and never tried authentic mexican food but once you come here please don't ever go to Taco Bell ever again! It would be the worst thing you could do your body after you have introduced it to this heaven... and don't forget to visit Diandras bakery next door if you manage to still leave a little room for dessert!!

As a first time visitor to the SF area... everyone recommended us to visit here. It didn't disappoint.The service. The atmosphere. The food.Everything is amazing here.We were able to speak to Michael (owner). It is obvious when you see this man that he loves doing what he does.He gave my friend and I a mango drink to try and roses. The drink tasted like real mangos. If I'd known, I would've tried other drinks too.I had the regular tacos and my friend had the beef head and tongue. Everything was delicious, especially the beef head !! The meat is so soft and so many toppings !

Home to one of best burritos in SF not sure what or who gave them that rating. Several awards on the walls state best in bay, multiple awards stating zagat rated( mind you if it says zagat rated I sadly laugh because zagat recently rated KFC best fried chicken in the nation!!! Thats a big wtf???? Lol) so let me break down what was sampled, and how it faired to some other taqueria's I have visited over the years.If this is your go to for fresh authentic mexican food, sure i'll bite and say it is good; but not best in the bay! So this is what I ordered, the super burrito with carne asada /carnitas (steak&pork). So the meat carne asada is good fresh made daily you literally see them cutting chunks of fresh beef and sectioning them into the trays to be provided for your order, same is to say about the chicken. The carne asada was tender, juicy, but for me lacked seasoning(salt) which is ok, just add green sauce for a kick and it is well worth it, the carnitas in my burrito was close to none, maybe one bite and half diced pork was in that bite so I can't comment on how good the pork was. If your looking for flavor and a good mesh of rice, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice and beans this place serves it up quick but again not as good as some other spotsWife tried two super carne asada tacos which came with crunchy tortilla, slice of cheese, meat, pico de gallo and sour cream, she did say taco wife it was good but not I have to go back good hahaMy son ordered the chips and guac, the chips he was happy with but the guac he stated had no taste. He's only 7yrs old so that says allot hahaFor best burrito in the bay, again sadly don't know how they got this rating, quick, fast, good after club or after drinking sure definite place to hit up, but for a meal without inebriation probably not the best you've hadBurrito's *** yep sadly hard 3Tacos ***.5 good; but not if not in the area not gonna drive out of the way to getPrice $$Service **** very helpful staffAmbiance *** narrow seating meant for small groups or just couples, one large table in the back all other tables are small for 2 people or squeeze 4 people

Ok this place is worth every hype it gets! It lives up to the amazing reviews. I ordered their crunchy taco with carne asada and they definitely pack your taco with a lot of meat. The meat was marinated SO WELL. I'm from LA and there's no place around in LA that's close to what La Taqueria offered to my taste buds! Get ready for a long line and therefore a long wait! All of it is worth it. The line actually moves pretty fast, the line was out the door and I went to the restroom real quick and we were about 5 people behind the register. Give this place a go, it's worth it. PS. their salsa verde is too good!!!

We were in San Francisco and carving some delish Mexican. We had a carne asada burrito, 1 carne asada taco and a carnitas taco. Overall the food was great it had nice favor. Finding a spot to eat can be tricky. The place was packed. We were also caught off guard that it was cash only. Totally understand the financial benefit of this to the business, but come on it's 2017! Went down to 4 stars instead of 5 because they didn't take credit cards. I felt my experience was limited to the cash that I had on me.

Literally ate the burrito in 5 minutes.Came here on a whim with two friends around 5pm. Damn the line was popping out the door. This also means that if you want a table you're going to swoop in like a hawk and stand your ground.Based on yelp we kept on seeing everyone ordering their tacos and burritos "el dorado" style. Even though we had no idea what that was we were going to yolo.Note: regular burrito has like nothing inside. Get the super burrito with that guacamole and pico de gallo.The lady who took our order told us that they don't do "el dorado" style on Saturdays. Bummer. BUT when we got to the check out guy we asked what was "el dorado" and basically it meant they fried the tortilla and make your burrito or taco crispy. We asked why they can't do el dorado style on Saturdays and he said, "What?? Yes we can" and proceed to make it el dorado for us.Bless you check out man. Another note: the size of their burrito is smaller than your average burrito. I'm so used to El Farlito size, so I thought 1/2 would be enough for me. I split one burrito with a friend and my half was the size of my palm. I gulf that burrito in 5 minutes! The size for $13 was not worth, BUT I have to admit their meat was soooo good. La Taqueria uses better quality ingredients so its up to you if that justifies the cost.

Average food with a high price tag. Super Burrito is not all that super. Long and thin with a soggy tortilla. I had the lengua super burrito, it was flavorful.although very skimpy on the filling. Maybe I came on a bad day. Restaurant was not overly busy when I entered although by the time I finished my meal it was packed. The best thing about the burrito is that they dont use rice. Super nice staff and very quick to make sure everything is clean.

SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD. You have to get the SUPER burrito DORADO style. The super burrito isn't terribly big, it just has cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. I'm not sure why you'd get the regular, cuz wouldn't that just be meat and beans? Yes this place doesn't put rice in their burritos which would be alarming at first but actually makes it taste much better, as rice doesn't have much taste. It's just a volumizer. So La Taq's burritos are perfectly assembled: thin layer of cheese melted INTO the tortilla, lots of meat (eh, could be more flavorful, i could barely taste it), but the perfect amount of sour cream, beans (I like pinto more than refried), and the GUACAMOLE just made it perfect. Dorado style warms the burrito and toasts the tortilla to be slightly browned and crispy. It's on the secret menu so you have to ask for it! They have spicy green sauce on the tables which is a nice addition. La Taq is in the Mission District, just a short walk away from 24th and Mission. The place is really cramped and kind of dirty. We got here at 5:45 and waited in line for 5 min, and found a seat easily. The burrito came in around 10 minutes. However by 6 pm the line just kept growing and it got packed real fast. By 6:30-7 pm the line's out the door. So I suggest just coming a little bit before the dinner rush if you can! No wifi.

Lives up to the hype. This really may be the best mission style burrito on the planet. Secret #1: Order dorado style. Secret #2: if you can find their phone number, they take phone orders. It's often faster to order by phone from the back of the line than to wait.

In my experience, if you see a place that's packed and with a line coming out the door, it's usually really good and worth the wait. That is certainly the case here. It's not just a taqueria. It's LA TAQUERIA. A taco will never be the same again. Order a Crispy Taco (not on the menu) It's a fried tortilla with melted cheese and a soft tortilla on top with heaps of meat, beans, sour cream, fresh avocado and salsa. It's CASH ONLY and the communal tables are first come first serve. ATM inside and CHASE is across the street. For dessert, walk to Dianda's: Italian Bakery Mission PieKing's Bakery

They don't call Mission District Little Mexico for no reason!This was one of my first ever Mexican food place in San Francisco, and OH MY GOODNESS, do I have high expectations after this. Going in on a weekend for lunch, this place had lines OUT THE DOOR. Quick services, with a little amount of tables, you have to use your eagle instincts and scout out which group of people are about to leave before you sit on the chairs.We got a regular pork (carnitas) burrito for $8.50 and a chicken taco for $4. If you're able to get seats, get it for here, cause burritos can get pretty messy! The wraps weren't wrapped super tightly, but the "SPECIAL SAUCE" that the meat is made with just makes all the delicious goodness come all together. Especially when it's mixed with beans, tomatoes and all these things that I usually don't eat, I'm surprised of how good it can be.In addition to this all, La Taqueria has won several awards - as you will probably be able to see if all plastered across the walls of the store!

Best burrito ever! Came here on the recommendation of a friend who stated this place is known to have the best burritos in the Mission. It sure did not disappoint! I love how you can get it "crispy". I ordered the super burrito and it was amazing. Perfect portions of all ingredients, fresh, and well-seasoned carne asada. I also got a horchata which had just the right amount of sweetness. Chips and salsa taste super refreshing too! Definitely will be back for more burritos :)

This place is world famous for one reason: they make bomb mexican food. We got the chicken burrito "Dorado" style - which means its grilled on the outside, the only way to go. I read about La Taqueria before my visit to SF and it was worth the ride to Mission. One of the best burritos of my life. The meat was so juicy and flavorful. The chips were just ok, but it didn't matter, I still have dreams about this burrito.

So, the wait to this place was a bit ridiculous and the fact that there was nowhere to sit was a bit frustrating. We were in town visiting some friends and they suggested this place for lunch as we were walking down the street. We were hesitant at first upon seeing the line, but in the end we are glad we decided to check it out. The burritos are huge and very good. They kept us full well into the evening. Once we placed our order, everything came out fairly quickly.

Apparently this is one of the most famous taco joints in the Mission District. And the owners seem to know it because the tacos are $$ and so I ended up getting a burrito upgrades to the super burrito, which meant avocado, sour cream, and cheese added. Overall my super burrito still cost $11, the most expensive burrito that I've had ever had....I think. And though the lengua burrito was soft delicious and stuffed full with meat, beans, and all the extra stuff (no rice in it, though), it was still considerably small for the price. For that reason, I'd rather go to El Farolito down the street which have much bigger burritos.Service was kind and they were quick to whip up 3 super burritos despite the long lines on Saturday. There are seats inside and out but they were hard to snag.

Yesterday I woke up at 4AM, and flew across the United States. The only food I consumed during that entire time period was a pumpkin donut and a handful of popcorn, so I was ravenous. A girl from my school recommended that we come to La Taqueria to eat. The Mission District of SF is so beautiful and colorful! La Taqueria was super crowded when we arrived at around 12PM. It is a cash only establishment, but they have an ATM in the back. I ordered two lengua (beef tongue) tacos, which was a good amount of food for lunch for me. These tacos were STUFFED to the brim with tender, juicy, savory, incredible lengua. There was salsa verde on the table which was a delicious addition to the tacos. I cannot describe the satisfaction my lunch at La Taqueria gave me. It was a fabulous meal.

Riceless burritos ftw! I always ask for little to no rice in my burritos but La Taqueria doesn't put rice in any of their burritos. Perfect for me but sucks for others who want the filler.The food here is amazing! All the ingredients that go into the burrito are quality ingredients. The carne asada was delicious and the guacamole was fresh and thick (unlike some places that serve water-y guacamole). The service was fast. Lines may look long but move fairly quickly. One person takes your order and you pay with another employee. By the time I sat down, our order was called shortly. Speaking of seating, there are plenty of tables and benches to sit at. Because it's fast food, most people leave by the time you are ready to sit.*CASH ONLY*

Line literally out the door, no room to sit but gave it a try. Being a vegetarian the only choice was a burrito with beans, sour cream and cheese. They don't have rice. It wasn't bad but I judge a place by its salsa and theirs was not very good. A little pico with not much flavor and a spicy green salsa with little flavor. I guess if you eat meat you get more in your burrito but for me wasn't that great. My daughters quesadilla was good although she did a big greasy. If you take it to go it's probably more enjoyable than fighting for a cramped spot.

La Taqueria has stood the test of time. Open since 1973 this is arguably the best burrito you can buy anywhere. If the gods of any religion were still around, you'd likely find them in line waiting on a carne asada burrito and taking selfies. Behind the dense crowd of gringos and tourists you'll find a bustling staff cranking out hundreds (if not thousands) of burritos a day. Don't like lines? There's plenty of other crappy options in every direction. Choose one.I've given this some careful thought. What makes La Taqueria so special? My answer: its simplicity. Beans, meat and salsa. That's what you're getting and they have truly perfected every ingredient. You can taste the freshness with every bite. Add some of the house salsa and you got yourself a mouth party! I love my burritos and can easily pick out bland or mediocre flavor. You really pay for what you get. It's definitely a little pricey but well worth it. I walked by this restaurant yesterday after having a big dinner. I almost got in line for second dinner after catching a whiff of grilled meat. The burrito struggle is real.Tip: Do yourself a favor. Order two burritos and take one home.

Can't lie, the burritos and tacos were delish! The place was packed so they are doing something right. We barely were able to find a seat it was so crowded (saturday afternoon/evening). Just don't plan to come if you are in a rush. We walked around the corner after eating to check out the Balmy alley street murals which were pretty cool too.

The weight time at 4 wasn't that bad about 20 minutes but this was also a Wednesday so the days may vary. I got a carne asada super burrito. The meat was extremely fresh and smokey, which was the star of the burrito. I thought for a super burrito the size was smaller than expected and the price of 11.70 tax included seemed a bit on priced end.

La taqueria is one of the "famous" taco and burrito places in San Francisco. They differentiate by not putting rice in your burrito (only meat and beans inside) and they give you the option to toast the burrito (called al dorado). I highly recommend getting your burrito al dorado because it gives the tortilla a better taste. I was a little disappointed that the prices were higher than the other really good burrito places ($12 vs $9 for the super burrito). Since there is no rice its not as big or as filling. The one good thing is that the line moves really fast so wait time is not bad.

This establishment has been around for decades! There were locals and tourists the day we went. The line was out the door around lunch time on Friday but the line moves quickly. Tables for customers to sit but people are quick to grab spots as soon as someone leaves. Ordered the supreme beef burrito to split - can definitely feed two. Beef was soft and juicy and they put a lot of avocado in. Everything was warm and melted together. Super flavorful but my friend personally though it was a bit too "wet" because the sour cream and everything melted into each other. Decent prices and cash only. There is an ATM in the restaurant.

Honestly, it's pretty good. Probably a little overhyped, but that doesn't make this burrito mediocre! Got the cabeza regular burrito w/avocado "Dorado" style. Dorado style REALLY makes a difference, it's sooooo good. I'm particularly impressed by how quickly our order was received and delivered! Only waited probably a half hour to order and get our delicious burritos. Satisfied :)

Cheap and tasty Mexican food!A friend and I stopped by from dinner around 7pm, and this place was bustling. The line starts from the inside and moves towards the street as you order. You're given a slip of paper that you bring to the register, you pay, and then wait for your order to be called.We were lucky enough to snag some seats. I "supered" my burrito, and got a heaping pile of chips and salsa to share. Everything was pretty good and I really appreciated the lady that was walking around wiping tables and setting chairs back in place.Overall, super efficient and fast place to get Mexican food (possibly to go if you can't find seating). There's bike parking right outside the taqueria!

Finally went to this spot! Came here with some co-workers for lunch and it was an overall very positive experience. Is it the best Mexican food I've ever had? Nope. Is it super super good? Oh yeah. We arrived here around 12:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was packed. we waited in line around 20 minutes to order and had to kinda hustle to find seating. I ordered a super burrito with carne asada and also got a strawberry fresca. We had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the food and when it came we chowed down. The burrito was very good. Meat was nice and juicy. The drink was nice and tasty and the fresh strawberries were great. This spot is a little out of my way, but I would definitely recommend coming down here to check it out. it's some very solid Mexican food!

After living in New York City for 7+ years I learned that just 'cos a restaurant always has a line out the door, gets glowing 5 star ratings on Yelp, and is written up as the "best", does NOT mean it's gonna live up to all the hype. Seeing as I hate to wait in line, it took me several weeks to sample a veggie taco at La Taqueria. And, actually, aside from the ever-present line, La Taqueria's steep prices turned me away more than once. I'm a SF native and live for the kind of food La Taqueria serves up. Whenever I leave the Bay Area, I crave our delicious burritos and tacos. However, in this so-called "sucka free city," I try to not let myself be bamboozled.I just spent $6.85 for a taco and chips! It was the smallest and most expensive veggie taco I've ever purchased and chips were not included. [I also went back later to sample a veggie burrito - for $6.31. It was the same size as what other taquerias refer to as a "baby burrito." Great if you're a light eater like me, but why pay top dollar for a half-size burrito?!]. The food was good but I refuse to join the ranks of stubborn locals who insist that this is the best of the best or ill-informed out-of-towners, who must read about La Taqueria in their tourist guides, and pay close to twice what I'd pay at any other Mission district taqueria.If you're reading this and debating whether or not La Taqueria is worthy of your $$$ and time, I'd suggest you go elsewhere (La Corneta, on Mission near 23rd St. is a good option - with lower prices, shorter lines, and chips and salsa included). Then again, if you're someone who likes to follow the crowd, equates a long line with reputability, and can handle high prices and small portions, go get in line at La Taqueria!

Get the super carne asada taco with hard shell (inside shell fried, outside is not). It'll be around $7 for one. Best thing there. Two tacos is like eating a burrito or maybe even 1.5 burritos xD. Best tacos in the mission, maybe. Not best tacos I've ever had, though.

This is a great Taqueria and one of the best i've been to in the Bay Area. I'm a taco guy so always get the prawn tacos whenever I come here. The prawns are seasoned perfectly and the taste doesn't get drowned out by beans or anything else you add. The tacos are a decent size and two regular tacos fill me up every time, plus you get a free basket of the house chips.Overall the place is great and I highly recommend it, but the knock on it is the dining area is small and it can be hard to get a table and they are cash only.

I have to admit I've been avoiding La Taqueria for years and for many reasons. It seems like every year, La Taqueria makes it on every top 10 list for its institution-like following of its burritos and tacos. With its never-ending notoriety, you can expect the lines at La Taqueria to be long; morning, day and night.This past Saturday, I decided to brave the crowds and skip my favorite taqueria and give La Taqueria a try - at last. The line wasn't as bad as I anticipated and ended a little before their door and didn't stretch onto Mission Street like I've seen in the past. The combination of the line and the small dining area made this place packed beyond belief. There wasn't one table empty as everyone got down on this warm Saturday afternoon.As the line crawled towards the front, the menu became more visible, and is as simple as can be: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, extras, and your choice of beverage, which includes a selection of soft drinks, aqua frescas and beer. I chose to go with my usual order and that's two tacos, one carne asada and one pollo asado. I decided to go with the regular taco, which is simply the protein, beans (refried or pinto) and pico de gallo. If you choose to super your taco, it adds sour cream, cheese and avocado for an additional $2.50It didn't take long for our number to get called which is typically standard at most taquerias. Once I set eyes on my tacos, I was impressed with the size, which correlates directly with the higher price point. The tacos were hefty and must of had a good 4 or 5 ounces of protein stuffed inside of them and topped off with pinto beans and pico de gallo.The pollo asado was lean and moist and and grilled perfectly. Even with the cilantro, pinto beans, and pico de gallo, it still lacked a little flavor; however the carne asada managed to save the day. The meat was juicy and had the flavor that was missing form the pollo asado. The taqueria does have a house sauce available at all the tables, which was a nice add on but be careful because it does pack plenty of heat. Overall, I enjoyed my tacos but given the higher price, and the crazy lines, I'm not prepared to make this my go to taqueria in the Mission. I do admit that their food is above-average and will satisfy any Mexican cravings, but it does come with a few flaws. I personally love the simplicity of a taco that is nothing but a tortilla, your chosen protein and topped with cilantro and onions. Regardless La Taqueria is a strong contender when it comes to choosing a taqueria when eating in the Mission; you simply can't go wrong.Ambiance/Decor: 3/5Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Price: $$Overall: 4/5Pros:+ A Mission District institution + Small and simple menu+ Lean and moist pollo tacos+ Carne asada tacos are a must try, packing plenty of favor+ Higher prices but larger portions+ Selection of aqua frescas and beer+ Fast and friendly staff+ Patio seating + Tacos dorados are a must try if you're from out of townCons:- Limited seating- Lines at all times of the day

Meh. That about sums up how I felt about this burrito. It had glowing recommendations from anyone and everyone, winning awards and everything. I was ready for my trek to the Mission to pay off with a burrito-shaped party in my mouth.The place was packed, even at 2pm, which was a good sign. There was, however, no seating available and hardly any room to move. The cashier was talking to some guy standing near her instead of taking orders, so the line went slowly.I got the super burrito with carnitas and hot sauce. It was incredibly unremarkable. There was zero heat from the sauce whatsoever, no interesting flavors, it wasn't a fantastic deal, really no redeeming qualities. It wasn't *bad*, but it was severely underwhelming. I've had far better burritos in the Mission, I don't see any reason to come here over any other place.

This spot is our favourite burrito place in the mission and it helps that we only live a couple of blocks away. We always bring out of town guests here and it's always a huge hit. My recommendation is the carne asada super but you know what? Everything is good. Always a toss up between the carnitas and carne asada. Try the lengua (beef tongue) for a different texture, if you want to try something new but really, can't go wrong with anything else on the menu. Okay great, now I'm craving a burrito!

Cash only! atm in the restaurant.Not a lot of seating, and not the cleanest looking restaurant. But it does sell some mean burritos and tacos. The burritos are $10ish dollars each. and imo you get more food if you order three tacos (and each are around #3).For burritos, you can get the "super" version, which doesn't mean the burrito itself is a larger size - they just add sour cream, cheese, and avocado to it, and the answer is always a yes. There are a lot of types of meats that you can put in it, but chorizo is always my fav since it has so much flavor!When there is a long line, someone will come down the line and take your order and give you a slip. You hold onto it, and give it to the cashier when you pay. Then they'll call your number (in both spanish and english) and you navigate through the crowd to pick up your food.The green sauce on the tables aren't too spicy, so feel free to be liberal.

Where do I begin? I loved everything about this place! When we entered la taqueria, it was crazy busy and people standing everywhere but the line moves fast so don't be put off by the swarm of people!I ordered two carne asada tacos - super, with a little bit of picante. I recommend super as you get the full shabang with pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream. I also ordered the strawberry aguas frescas which was delicious!You line up and order in one line and then you pay in another, then you pick up your food when your number is called. We got a table quickly as people don't hang around too much. The food was super delicious and tasty - i highly recommend it! P.S Cash only.
