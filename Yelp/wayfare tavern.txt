Those popovers though! Probably my favorite thing out of this whole experience.I came for lunch and had their fried chicken. Service was amazing and I definitely loved their bar setup ( upstairs &down). While the fried chicken was really good, it was just... fried chicken. Haha I'd definitely come back to try their dinner menu!

Yes, it's a restaurant driven by a TV celebrity chef, but one that measures up, even here in the discerning Bay Area. The atmosphere is classic and boisterous, like an old-school club dining room and bar, and there is a seriously touristy element here.Nevertheless, the portions are gigantic and the quality and taste evident. Their "best in America" organic fried chicken does live up to the hype. It's a huge heap of chicken that's fried perfectly lightly and breaded incredibly deliciously, with a hint of spices in there. Like other entrees here, don't be turned off by the sticker prices. They're actually quite reasonable by West Bay standards given all that you get.On that note, I was already quite full from the chicken, but I'd skipped appetizers in order to save room for dessert after eyeing what other folks were having. The brownie sundae (vanilla bean ice cream, valrhona fudge brownie, toffee sauce, candied pistachio, macerated cherries) didn't disappoint. It was a gigantic, gooey, sweet heap of goodness, reminiscent of over-the-top sundaes you'd get from ice cream fountains of yore.Service is also amazingly friendly and engaging, again in an old-school, New York steakhouse or Italian restaurant sort of way. Highly recommended for both visitors looking for familiar comfort food and for locals looking for good quality and excellent value.

MIND BLOWN! Upon arriving to a "celebrity chef" restaurant ones expectations are high. We were blown away by the service first and foremost as we arrived during lunch hour. We were greeted kindly and reassured that we'd be seated shortly. We had a front row view of the chefs which made the experience enjoyable!We were wined and dined to say the least by Johnny, who made an effort to make our lunch an experience by offering us "custom drinks". We had French 75s (GET THEM) and arugula salads and shared polenta fries. So so yum. I was so incrediblyImpressed by the simple, yet delicious salads and the polenta fries were delicious!Kudos to Tyler Florence and the staff at Wayfare this foodie was impressed.

This place gets busy for dinner rush fairly quickly. That being said either go early or make a reservation.It's a comfortable cozy and a narrow space. Your surrounded by dark wood everywhere so that may contribute to this perception but all in all a great little space. Everyone is extremely professional and whether they are your server or not - they check up on you.I came here to try the fried chicken which apparently is one of the best. So of course I had to pop and try it. Now, I can say this -it's very good. Have it drizzled with lemon that makes it taste better. All that being said, it's not the best I've had. It's good but knowing I had to spray it with lemon to make it sing well...my award for the best goes elsewhere. Marcus Samuelsons streetbird - delicious but a restaurant called Hair of the Dog still has a solid fried chicken. Give it a whirl. It's good. Have it with some sides and call it a meal! By the way - points to the design in the bathrooms. I thought it was much more interesting than the actual restaurant. Love the red wallpaper.

When you're on vacation, you escape away from your daily routines. Wednesday night for you might be spaghetti night. All week long our dining habits have changed. After a few days, it hits you. I'm craving a good burger.I've been a Tyler Florence fan and I know he has a place in the bay area. Come to find out, his place is close to my hotel?? Awesome.. My wife and I walk into a beautiful looking pub. Inside there are a few tables available, we're also offered tables outside, I see they've provided blankets because its cool outside?? Nice touch TF, nice. I'm also told they have a chefs table available. I'm game, lets try the chefs table. Our waiter is ultra cool, he explains to us different beers as well as a refreshing lemonade. I order a beer, my wife has this amazing lemonade and then they bring over something crazy. Homemade popovers. BLT Steak in NYC brings these amazing popovers to the table. These popovers? Are BETTER than BLT steak! My wife and I licked the plate clean, soooooo good!We both ordered the same thing, the Wayfare Tavern Burger. From the perfectly baked Brioche bun to the proprietary grind of beef topped with brie cheese, red onion marmalade and smoked bacon, this burger was made perfectly. The fries are also cooked in a gastropub style.We had our burgers and felt like we had our fix satisfied. If you're looking for a beer and a good burger, Wayfare Tavern is the place to get your burger fix fixed.

The popovers, alone, are a treat worth coming for. Something so simple as bread done so so so right, it makes you reevaluate your silly first world problems. Well, that's until the bill follows right after your meal. But in those few minutes of enjoying your popover. Bliss. The fried chicken I've heard so much about also lived up to its hype. I'll be honest, I'd be perfectly happy with a bucket of popeyes chicken for the rest of my life but it is eye opening to taste fried chicken that is not greasy and oily, yet still delicious as ever. The only fried chicken I've ever consumed that did not induce any guilt post meal. I can't wait to come back whenever I'm in the area.

Great food, excellent service. I LOVE the use of fresh herbs in their dishes, from appetizers to dessert. We had an issue with our order when we were there most recently. We ordered scallops and received salmon. There were apparently no scallops left. Our waiter was extremely apologetic and offered a substitute as well as the dish taken off of our bill. We stuck with the salmon, which was great. We shared the salmon and fried chicken. It's great to get a little taste of both. The friend chicken is second to none, and the salmon was perfectly prepared. I question whether there were ever scallops that day, as we arrived very early, just before 5pm, in order to make a Sunday show at the Orpheum after. Our waiter was excellent, he timed out the meal so we were neither rushed nor late. We arrived to our show right on time. I have a hard time resisting donuts, so my table of three shared the donut dessert. It is so delicious!The donuts are small and served warm, with tasty dipping sauces (and more herbs!) on the side. I could've eaten the whole thing, but I'm always glad I shared. I can't imagine there's a better dessert on the menu, but maybe one day I'll cheat on the donuts. While I didn't order wine or cocktails for fear of falling asleep at the theater, but I have tried a cocktail here in the past. It was a caprese martinis and it was interesting and delicious. I really wanted to try something else, but I wanted to stay awake at Hamilton more!

Ok, we went here because Food & Wine listed it as one of the best fried chicken places in the US. I knew some of the other places listed and thought this would be a must-try. What a disappointment. I ordered a mix of breasts and drumsticks. When it came I had five chicken breasts on my plate. I asked the server where my drumsticks were. She explained that there were "lots of bowls of chicken in the kitchen" and "they are very busy." WTF? She offered to bring me a couple after seeing my incredulous expression. It didn't matter. The chicken was totally undistinguished, somewhat dry and barely battered in a bland crust. F&W lost a lot of credibility with me. The succotash was very good though. But it's so noisy you can't hear yourself think. Skip it. Not worth the hype or the wait.

I've come here twice: once for takeout because I was working late, and once for a work lunch. Both times, I've been pretty impressed with the food. I've ordered:1. Beef Tartare2. Burrata 3. Fried Chicken4. Tavern BurgerInstead of getting normal bread while you wait for your meal, you get warm, buttery popovers. I found that very unique and delicious. All the food is really good, you really can't go wrong with anything that you order here, at least that is what I think. I think the fried chicken has won some sort of award, but don't expect mind blowing chicken. I've definitely had better fried chicken. The portions here are very good for the price, considering you are in the SF FiDi. It is a safe bet to bring a client here for lunch or dinner. Service is usually pretty good. I would come again for a meal, if I wanted some good old fashion American food that was done well. Definitely make a reservation in advance if you know you will be coming.

My husband and I hosted our wedding reception at Wayfare Tavern, and it was truly amazing! From the beginning, Mary and the private dining staff made the process so easy. I was pretty obsessed with everything, but Mary was always willing to accommodate my requests and details. The prices are very fair for what you get, and the food is to die for! The portions were out of this world, and there was so much left over.Sadly, I didn't get to eat much on my wedding day, but thankfully we had a tasting beforehand. The Bartlett room is a great size for an intimate reception, we had about 45 guests + the staff. We had the bar setup, and we brought in a Photobooth. Once we finished the course, the staff made room for a dance floor. The dancing portion was pretty lit, and the staff were just fine with it.Overall, I truly recommend Wayfare Tavern as a hangout or to have your special event.

Wonderful music - puts one in a great mood to eat GREAT food. Deviled eggs are delish! Fried chicken is beyond wonderful - I doubted it....BUT boy oh boy! Put a sprinkle of lemon juice and you're set. I ordered the tavern burger, friends ordered deviled eggs, chicken, oysters, and delightful dessert - vanilla cheesecake and freshly fried doughnuts. I'll be back....especially for that chicken!

Yes yes and yes, add this to your list of favorite little hideaways in the city. We came in late, almost closing time but didn't realize it. Even so, we were seated immediately at the chef's table, which I had mixed feelings about initially, but that turned out to be a unique experience. The menu here is not extensive but it gets the job done: great apps that include a rocking shrimp cocktail, a salad that you can add their famous fried chicken or king salmon to, a juicy burger, and a host of miscellaneous sides. We ordered the fried chicken with macaroni and cheese as a side and also their classic burger that comes with fries. The fried chicken had a great crispy coating that was flavored with rosemary and lemon. It was a nice touch that I'm sure got them the "best fried chicken" award. The burger was AWESOME and one of he best I've had in a while. Macaroni and cheese wasn't your grandma's mac but it was still delicious. The BEST part of our meal was the French fries and the chef's table was definitely a great experience. We were too full to try any deserts but they looked great. I'll be back for more!

My roomie and I stumbled into Wayfare Tavern the minute that they opened. Although the restaurant was still completely empty, we were told that we snagged the last available table. True enough, it seemed all the other seats were reserved, as the dining hall quickly filled up in the next half hour. We both felt super out of place since everyone else was dressed in business casual - probably FiDi people off on lunch break. Meanwhile, I was rocking a plain white tee and my favorite Uniqlo hoodie. Real classy.// Popover (complimentary) - 5 starsDelicious! The popover was soft like Yorkshire pudding, which I absolutely love.// Petaluma Farms Deviled Eggs ($14) - 4 starsOne order gets you six half eggs topped with a rich creamy filling. They were really good, but I couldn't finish my fair share since they were quite heavy.// Organic Fried Chicken ($26) - 3 starsDespite all the rave, the fried chicken here was just average. The only sauce it comes with is a lemon wedge, which would have been acceptable if the chicken were overflowing with juices, which it wasn't.// The Tavern Burger ($22) - 3 starsExtremely filling as the burger was loaded with so much fats: bacon, brie, and brioche buns. Still, this didn't really knock my socks off, which it should have considering the hefty price point.// Brussels Sprout Panzanella ($9) - 4 starsI enjoyed how the sprouts were coated in a tangy cranberry glaze. The best parts of this side dish, however, were the crunchy chunks of country bread.

I went here last week with my coworkers and members of our Board of Trustees, so it was a fairly important lunch. Everything was planned many weeks in advance. When we arrived, the six of us were crammed into a booth, literally rubbing elbows together. We asked about moving upstairs where we could sit at a table instead. The waitress kept saying no that wasn't an option and that they didn't have larger tables upstairs. Several of us knew from prior experience that this wasn't true. But we just accepted staying in the crowded booth instead. As a few entrees were being delivered, the wrong meal was put in front of one of our Trustee guests, and when we inquired about it, the waiter moved the meal over to the correct person and then sarcastically said "I only have two hands", then walked away. Amazing disrespect. We all looked at each other in shock. Then throughout the meal, our main waiter continued to interrupt loudly every time he came over to us, talking over whoever was speaking at our table at the time without pausing to wait for a brief second or two so as not to be rude. I counted three times he did this. Last but not least, one meal was never delivered after all the others were, and the waiter explained that he forgot to put the order in for it. It was gnocchi which should've taken a very short time to prepare, however the meal never showed up for another 25-30 minutes. The rest of the group had already finished eating by the time it arrived. So many negative things in one lunch experience. It was so bad that we were laughing about it later but truly one of the worst meal experiences for all of us.

When a restaurant boasts that their fried chicken is one of the best in the nation, you'd best come to try it. I've been lucky to come to this establishment twice without picking up the tab by way of client and boss-hosted lunches there, as I would usually try to avoid places like this more than once for the sake of my wallet. This place just screams of opulence and old-time SF vibes, which made me feel classier than I usually am. Both times I've been here, I've ordered: Deviled eggs: 4 half hardboiled eggs with yolk sticking out. Dish had a gorgeous presentation. Yolk was creamy and light. Fried chicken: PERFECT. It had the right level of crunchiness to the crust, and the meat was still moist and tender. It is definitely on a different level than that of KFC or even the fried chicken sandwiches at The Bird down on New Montgomery. The rosemary garnish was perfect to go with it. Oh and before the deviled eggs were even served, I was fortunate enough to get two helpings of these bread things I've now come to know as "popovers", and man are they delicious! Think croissant but better! Excellent service and venue!!

I came here for my friend's 21st birthday. Since it seemed like a very popular restaurant on Yelp, I decided to make reservations on OpenTable and in the notes, I mentioned that it was my friend's birthday. She was surprised with a birthday card at our table. My friend ordered a grapefruit drink, which was supposed to be mixed with gin, but she substituted it was vodka. It was quite strong, but refreshing at the same time.The complimentary popovers (bread) was the HIGHLIGHT of the meal. Imagine a better version of the best croissant you have ever had, but even better. The butter that came with the bread was smooth and easy to spread. It melted right when you spread it on the popovers. And the best part is it's UNLIMITED.What we ordered:BEEF TARTARE - This was delicious. If you know what a Chinese pork bun tastes like, it tastes exactly like the pork filling, probably because of the green onions and other spices. The portion size was pretty big for an appetizer. We were also able to get more chips. PORK CHOP (~$30) - This is one of the juiciest pork chops I've ever had. I wouldn't think that such a thick piece of meat could be so flavorful. The risotto it came with was delicious as well.FRIED CHICKEN (~$26) - This dish was one of the most popular among Yelpers, so I had to try it. It was good fried chicken, but didn't live up to the hype for me. Don't get me wrong though; it was a really food fried chicken.MAC AND CHEESE (~$15) - I really enjoyed this dish. It's probably one of the best baked mac and cheeses I have ever had. It was rich and creamy, but not overwhelming. To be honest, I would've been happy with this as a main course, despite it being a side dish. This had pretty big portions for it just being a side dish. The service was great too. When we got the rest of our food togo, we were given a claim ticket for our togo, which we gave to the hostess on our way out and received of togo bag. This was a nice, but unnecessary touch.

We were literally the first customers of the day at 11AM on a weekday, which lasted our entire meal, so it was nice and quiet.The complimentary popover was one of the best things we ate. We ordered the Organic Fried Chicken, and the Burrata & Pears on country bread. The fried chicken was good, but we wanted more crunch on the breading (instead it was light and delicate).I really enjoyed the burrata and pears. For a lighter yet satisfying and delicious lunch option, get that. Lightly toasted and buttered bread with the sweet pears and creamy burrata was excellent.

Popover dude only came by once! I was so pissed, I wanted to eat one more popover. So good! First time coming back since 2011, nearly six-years ago. I still love the feel inside this restaurant. When it first opened it just followed suit with what the restaurant interior trends were: Turn of the century light fixtures, exposed Edison bulbs, Victorian-esque wall paper, taxidermy, reclaimed dark woods. And while most restaurants have moved on to a more minimal, institutionalized, clinical 1930s chic look...Wayfare stands aesthetically strong. I love the inside of this place still.Ordered the fried chicken (again) $26 | I remember the portion being bigger. I split the order with a girlfriend. Still delicious, just wish the crust was a wee bit thicker. But, I happen to be a crust lovin' mofo. Everything was solid. From the Burrata Whipped Potatoes $9 to the Brussel Sprout Panzanella $9. Doughnuts $11: two come to an order, hot and fresh out the fryer into your mouth. Came with a dipping sauce of (what I think was) pear puree and whipped creme fraiche and a vanilla glaze. Those doughnuts are earth shattering. One gripe: One of my girlfriends asked for sparkling water and there was a $7 charge. Like, hot dayum! It came in a carafe, so it's obvious they have one of those filtration systems that provides sparkling water. Usually restaurants will inquire if you prefer still or sparkling and won't charge you for either.Parking can be found on weekends, but forget it on weekdays. There are a few lots nearby. They have valet service, but only in the evenings and it's $12. Clean and roomy single user bathrooms. Very nice service. Seating isn't packed like sardines, which makes it comfortable for gordas.Fine Dining and Casual Fine Dining List: bit.ly/2hi5Dtu

Food is good, drinks well made, nice selection of wines and beers. Service was a bit off, we sat at the bar and it was busy for a late night call, but I had to call the bartender to take our order, seemed weird but oh well. Our burgers the first time weren't the right temp so they made a new order for us, highly recommended. Overall, a good experience and I will visit again.

Needless to say, the fried chicken and salmon were amazing. We paired that with the polenta fries and the whipped mashed potatoes. (All of which I would highly recommend!) But, I'm writing this 5-star review on behalf of our server, Johnny. (Johnny, if you're reading this, you're the best)He was so welcoming, so accommodating, and so funny! He gave us just the right amount of direction to help us decide on what to order, and affirmed our choice every step of the way.It's crazy how your server can either make or break your experience, regardless of the food. Johnny did the former, and we're definitely coming back because of him.

To be fair, when I went here I was very very full. I had gotten too excited watching the warriors game and forgot that I should STOP EATING because we were about to have dinner. Okay. I failed at not being a child on that count. My bad. People have some RAVE reviews of this place, and, don't get me wrong, this place has an amazing atmosphere, is impeccably decorated and has fantastic service. But.... the drinks weren't that great. We ordered 4 different drinks for the table, sent two back and the other two were only meh (we sent back the tequila drink). We got fries with our burger (both fries and burger were good), brussel sprouts (also good) and split the pork chop (good but seemed to be a bit over done). We ordered the ice cream and the cake for dessert and the home made ice cream was meh- not very flavorful and generally not anything to write home about (probably a little bit less flavored than even the stuff you buy in a carton in any grocery store). Overall, maybe worth a drink and some small bites, but was very underwhelmed by the food after all the hype.

We dined at the Sequoia Room last night. It was really unimpressive. The service was rotten and the food was unbelievably mediocre. The fried chicken was billed as the best in the world, and that was utter hogwash. Kentucky Fried Chicken is better. Popeyes is better. Palmetto Pig is light years better. They kept talking about this four-step secret process that includes buttermilk brine. Wow, no Omaha hausfrau ever thought of that after watching Rachel Ray. Let's talk service. We walked in, got a seat, made a drink order, and didn't see a waiter for 45 minutes after that. Our drinks went empty repeatedly. It took forever to order food and even longer to get said food. I finally called over another waiter and asked him WTF was going on and where our waiter was. Eater bills this place as "super exclusive". Yeah, keep telling yourself that. You could get the same service by going to KFC after they close, turn the lights off, and eat stale fried chicken from earlier in the day by yourself. We have places like this in Chicago, and they generally feature self-important toolboxes convincing themselves that they're important for eating here. The chef-owner usually is "creating an experience" for you. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.... whatever.

We had pretty bad service at Wayfare tonight. Food was all tasty (nothing amazing), but we ordered an off-menu special (rib eye steak). The server was very nice, but completely neglected to mention the price of the special. Unfortunately we also forgot to ask for the price (our bad) and had some extreme sticker shock when the bill arrived. The ribeye was 120 dollars, which is three times more expensive than the most expensive entree on the menu. We politely mentioned the surprise to our host and he said he'd check with the manager. The manager then came by to say he wasn't able to fix anything, the price of meat has gone up, but to "come back next time and mention his name" and he'd see what he could do then. We will definitely not be coming back and were all very disappointed in how they handled the situation. Prices for specials should be mentioned, especially if they are significantly more than other entrees. For a restaurant of Wayfare's caliber, I expect better service than we experienced tonight.

My sweetheart made a reservation for a "romantic dinner" when we drove in from San Jose. We were seated right in front of the fireplace, which was very appropriate.We loved the decor. We started each with a tasty popover ... she had a white Chardonnay which she LOVED.The service was outstanding, very attentive and professional. Our server's wine recommendation was spot on.She found her Organic Fried Chicken to be tasty - but a little dry. She said "It wasn't juicy like the last time I had it". She thought her Brussels Sprouts were sumptuous.I had the Wayfare Burger; thick and full of flavor ... but the bun crumbled on my first bite and I was left to eat at least half of it with my knife and fork, to keep it from becoming a gooey mess in my hands. I was slightly disappointed. At $22.00 for a burger and fries ..... I expected more. The service and the food didn't match.

Wayfare Tavern. You are so good to me and my stomach. I took a friend here for her birthday recently and I always love coming in here to eat. We shared everything we ordered and left completely satisfied. The popovers here are my absolute favorite. Please eat more than one on my behalf. The Fresh Burrata is a great starter so I would highly recommend that. The Roasted Pork Chop was amazing and not dry! The Roasted Summer Squash was also a fan favorite- that tomato marmalade and arugula pesto combination is genius. Finally, we had the Peaches and Cream Verrine and I could have eaten a couple of those on my own. Our waiter was also really sweet and we loved our meal here so much! Will definitely be back!

Went here with my mother and aunt during my recent visit to SF. They had both been before and said I would be in for a treat. They had made a reservation and we were seated in a crowded restaurant, even at 2pm on a Friday.To start off the meal, we decided to go with an order of the deviled eggs and burrata.I don't know if I am super hard to please when it comes to deviled eggs, but I was very underwhelmed by this rendition. Felt like I have made better ones myself.Thankfully, the rest of the meal was a step up.The burrata was very tasty--and unlike other places that I have had this dish at, this one featured fruit with it, which provided a nice bit especially with their fresh bread.Speaking of bread, the popovers that they serve are excellent and are so buttery and flaky--definitely didn't need it after the burrata, but couldn't say no.For my main meal I got their fish special, which I believe was a swordfish that particular day. Whatever it was, it was very tasty and a good portion size as well.I was also lucky enough to try a piece of my aunt's fried chicken, and that was delicious too.Overall, this place has a great vibe and serves up some quality food. The prices are a bit high, but not unreasonably so compared to the rest of the city. The service was super friendly and personable and the food came out quickly. Not a bad spot to check out if you are in the area, whether it be for food, drinks, or both.

Wayfare Tavern has been on my list to try for years, actually, but I so rarely make it to FiDi, I'd written it off, until chance circumstances placed us in the area on a Saturday afternoon. We made a reservation online to be safe, but it was definitely not needed.THE OVERVIEW.+ Dark, kind of woodsy/swanky place, probably a lot more exciting at night than during the day- Expensive for what you get, although the price points make sense given the neighborhood~ Parking can be tricky, with a lot of time-related restrictions+ Delicious, buttery steak tartare, definitely recommend this- $14 for the equivalent of 3 eggs that were deviled? What market did you buy these from?!- $5/6 per oyster, which is just incredible and offensive, really. Even Zuni Cafe doesn't charge as much, and you know the quality is comparable or better- The dark meat pieces of fried chicken were outstanding; the white meat pieces were dry and flavorlessThe biggest issue, I'm afraid, was....SERVICE.- Snooty service from a number of the staff, which was surprising. We were dressed as nice or nicer than 99% of the other patrons, we were polite and well mannered, but still got the cold shoulder from a) the host, b) our server, c) the popover runner guy. No idea if it was a race thing or a 'I hate my job' thing, but it was pretty unpleasant- When I asked if we could sit in a booth, which another party of 2 was doing, the host stopped, looked at us, and told me the booths were reserved for larger parties. That booth remained empty the entire time we dined there, very bizarre- We were seated in the far corner of the restaurant, almost like we were being hidden away? Again, was it a race issue? Did the host not like how either of us looked? No idea, but it was very uncomfortable- We don't eat bread (a sad but necessary truth), so when the waiter came by to toss popovers at us, I quickly declined, not wanting to waste food for no reason. He literally rolled his eyes, and started grabbing anything related to bread from the table, including the butter. Then when we had to ask him to leave the butter (keto diet is real, guys), he rolled his eyes again and stormed away after dropping it on the table.It was funny and uncomfortable how unpleasant the staff was. We appeared to be an incredible annoyance. Our waiter in the end was charming, but the rest of the staff we had to deal with was a very miserable experience. I don't know, look into working in a different industry if you're that miserable?

Made a reservation and we were running a little late. They were very accommodating since it wasn't as a busy on Christmas Eve-eve. They sat us right in from of the fire place which was nice, but a little tight. I felt like we were so close to the couple next to us. I totally forgot our waiter's name, but he was super nice! I noticed that since we were the last guests of the night, staff got pretty loud and some didn't care to help us when we called for attention. My favorite dish was the beef tartare! Wow that was the best I've had and it was a good size. I also loved the burrata pear appetizer, very refreshing. The pork shank was my favorite entree. I wasn't a big fan of the top sirloin, it was a bit dry. The Brussel sprouts were delicious , but I didn't care for the panzanella. I haven't tried the fried chicken, so ill definitely come back for that and the burrata whipped potatoes.If you want a good hearty meal, I suggest this place!

The best eggs in my life I ever had.. were from here. It was made using a double broiler. It was the fluffiest egg. And to this day.. I still crave them and remember them vividly.If you can, I highly recommend this place. The menu is always changing, but the food is divine.

It pains me not to give this restaurant a stellar review, as it has been on my restaurant bucket list for some time now, but I genuinely did think it was just A-OK.THE HITS- The decor here is perfection and I love the feel of the restaurant.- The popovers were to die for and lucky you, they come free with your meal!- Mashed potatoes were perfection. But it was a small portion, so for a group of 4 I would consider ordering two of them if that's the only side you get.- The desserts, but specifically the donuts. We ordered all of them and they were all excellent, but those were my favorite.- Fried chicken. A number of people at the table ordered this and they all enjoyed it.THE MISSES- I ordered the fish, which was sea bass that day I believe, and thought it was very bland and boring. Plus it was overcooked. Not a fan at all and probably a large reason behind the 3 stars.- There was a long wait for our drinks and food and I ordered a second drink that was never delivered to me. There was a large party in the private room next to us, so I think it was likely due to that. I understand these things happen, but at such a nice restaurant it takes away from the experience. That said, our waiter was very apologetic for the delays, which I appreciated.

Super cozy and comfy atmosphere. I ordered the fried chicken to share and had the macaroni and cheese. These two things are so basic but done so well. The chicken was fried perfect, extremely juicy when I broke into it. The little wedge of lemon was such a perfect topping to break up the fattiness of the chicken. The herbs with the chicken went so well together! I definitely suggest eating the garnish, don't just dismiss them. The mac and cheese was what you could expect. Perfectly crunchy topping. We also topped off dinner with some doughnuts. It was yummy, but i truly don't have much of an opinion on the dessert. It was great. I plan to come back!

Came here a while back, so I don't recall every dish we tried. But I do remember that the popovers and donuts here are so so good!Complimentary popovers were delicious on their own, and even better with the addition of butter. The donuts were heavenly. Served warm, and perfectly sweet and chewy.Their famous fried chicken was just OK - it had a nice crunchy crust, but like many other have said, lacked flavor / salt. Very lackluster.Service here was great, no complaints.

I've heard great things about this place, but I was hardly impressed by the food and atmosphere. My friend and I got a table outside for dinner, and it was quite cold. We knew that obviously, there's nothing the restaurant can do about that... UNTIL we saw that the table that sat down next to us about 20 minutes into our meal were offered blankets, and we were not. Not the best customer service.The food overall was fine, but it didn't live up to the expectations I had. Small portions and a little bland. We got the backed macaroni & cheese and a seasonal vegetarian pasta dish. The best part were definitely the popovers. Don't think I would necessarily try this place again.

Woohoo, first to review this hip spot! The Sequoia is on the 4th floor of Wayfare Tavern and it's officially opened to the public! I was extremely excited to snag a table for the grand opening yesterday. The interior is chic and you can see the Transamerica pyramid over a glass window on the ceiling. It's more of a lounge with a cool bar and some tables for dinning, smaller snacks but they do offer Tyler Florence's famous fried chicken! The lavendar moscow mule and the brut rose drink (inspired by Employees Only in NYC) were both good.There is also a vault room that can fit up to 4, which is first come first serve, would make a romantic date. ;) Shout out to our lovely host Marcus for showing us!

I had to have the fried chicken to see what was special about F&W "best fried chicken ". $26 for half a chicken in 5 pieces. Moist but needed salt. No crunchy batter, which was disappointing. The arugula salad was excellent. I loved the popover. Service was top notch.

The legendary fried chicken was very, very good, but it didn't change my life like many of the reviews on Yelp said it would. It's just really good fried chicken. Personally, I think I've had better. (/hides) I started with the beef tartare and found that more enjoyable than the fried chicken; I don't love that it was served with chips rather than crostini, but the flavors in the dish were really nicely balanced. My wife had the gnocchi and enjoyed them as well. I would go back, but as I said it didn't knock my proverbial socks off.

The first time I've eaten here, I was ecstatic because I was dining at a Tyler Florence establishment. I wish I wrote a review back then, which was years ago and I vaguely remember my meal. But nonetheless I left with a full stomach and without an ounce of regret. 5 stars for my past experience. This time around, I'm so sorry but the food was simply MEHHH. On the other hand, our waitress provided great service and a connectable conversation. Cucumber mint mule: I needed a drink after a busy day at work - quenched my thirst.House Made Popovers with Whipped Butter Spread: I think I came here craving some well made popovers which I enjoyed and wanted seconds.Beef Tartar With House Kettle Chips: I enjoyed it very much. It was a bit heavy on the capers, but didn't bother me.Mac N Cheese: well made and delicious, and that's all I can say.Sole: my friend who ordered this dish said it was a bit heavy handed on the salt. I took a bite of it and it tasted like that of the sea. Black pepper was continuously added to balance the dish as it was being eaten. Wayfare Burger: my cousin asked for medium rare and what was brought from the kitchen was on the medium side. Our waitress had the kitchen make a second, which was perfect but the bun was over greased. Due to the wait, her appetite was filled with the other dishes at the table and so the burger became a to go meal. Fried Chicken: great seasoning, and classic butter milk recipe. Other than that, I can't say that it was the best fried chicken I've had. Pork Shank: over cooked, tough and chewy or OTC... I enjoyed the apple and cabbage side more so than the actual meat on the plate. I didn't feel like informing our waitress as I did not want to wait. I left full but disappointed with the meal. I wouldn't say that I'd never return but I don't think Tyler Florence would be happy with what was brought out from his kitchen staff.

Popovers! The most magnificent popovers I have ever had if you do nothing else here treat yourself and have a cucumber mule and the popovers they are both to die for. I do suggest that you go a step further and order dinner everything we ordered was made with quality ingredients. The flavors were delightful and the portions very big. Desert was good but nothing to phone home about so I suggest trying the appetizers instead of saving room for desert. The atmosphere is upscale and inviting. I do suggest you make a reservation before going as they can get really full really fast.

I've had this placed bookmarked for awhile now, so when the boyfriend and I finally went to SF, we definitely wanted to try this place out! I didn't look into it deeply, so I was surprised when we walked in and it seemed to be pretty fancy and we were asked if we had reservations. Not fancy enough where you have to dress up, but it definitely was not a typical restaurant. Luckily, the party ahead of us threw a fit about waiting and left, so we got the last open table! We ordered the must have Organic Fried Chicken, besides it being a little dry, lived up to the raving yelp reviews. We also ordered the Day Boat Scallops, after overhearing the table next to us say it was a new addition to the seasonal menu. BEST decision ever... absolutely delicious... I still think about it til this day.... Lastly, we ordered a side of the baked mac n cheese and it was just your average "fancy" mac n cheese. Could have gone without that for sure. We sat by the fire where they have 3, 2 seater tables. If you're someone who hates sitting really close to other people, then you might hate just how close you are next to one another. It's not a big deal to me, especially when the people next to you are nice. The ambiance and service was great, no complaints there. We will definitely be back the next time we are in SF.

Giving this place 3.5 stars! My boyfriend took me here last night for our monthaversary dinner (Yes. We celebrate the months. Get over it). I think I'm going to remove his responsibilities of choosing places for dinner. I was excited to try this place after reading its reviews, however I was left a little disappointed at the end of out night. They have mastered the art of re-creating comfort food with a fanciful touch. Their popover bread was the perfect touch to starting our meal. It was very light and extremely tasty with a spread of their butter. Doesn't leave you feeling bloated before receiving the main course.You cannot mess up fried chicken, and I have to admit, Wayfare's rendition is quite juicy with a light crunch. They generously place 5 pieces of a chicken with a garnish of crisp herbs, yet the plate seemed to be lacking a kick of flavor. My tastebuds were expecting a little more. Added a bit of their house-made Tabasco and it seemed to do the trick. However, I commend them for serving moist white meat, which usually tends to be dry. I'll give them that.Boyfriend was non-stop raving about their house burger, and could not get over the fact that he was able to add egg to it. (lol welcome to 2016, buddy). I took one bite into his burger, and tasted meat and buns. I was not impressed. Also, his burger patty was secreting blood and turning his buns pink, which turned me off. He loved it so, whatever makes him happy. Mac & cheese seemed to have lacked a cheese flavor. It tasted like pasta and milk, really. I love cheese, so I was a bit heartbroken that my mac was lacking its cheese counterpart ): To make up for my anticlimactic meal, I decided to give their chocolate pie a try and I was blown away.I was melting in its decadent layers of chocolate and whipped cream. Most of these stars are going to ambiance. We snagged a seat in front of the kitchen, which really gave us a dinner & a show. I sipped on my glass of sauvignon blanc and felt like I was in the comfort in my own bed, watching the Food Network.

What to get: the fried chicken. Last time I went we got the Brussels sprouts, baked mac and cheese and 4 orders of the fried chicken. The service was pretty slow but they kept on bringing us popovers and we finished 2 bottles of wine waiting.

I went to Wayfare Tavern for a company lunch this last Tuesday, May 17th at 12 noon. We had a private room on the third floor.(I'd suggest taking the stairs as the elevator took forever. I think they use it as their freight elevator since they were transporting cases of drinks up and down the restaurant. I had to squeeze into the tiny elevator with a dolly filled with drinks and a guy carrying a huge box of flower centerpieces.)Since we were doing a private party, we had a prix fixe menu. They were nice enough to print specialty menus for our company luncheon.Starters:*Butter lettuce salad: avocado, caviar, lemon balm*Roasted rainbow carrots: burrata, basil, carrot top salsa verde, sunflower seedsI chose the butter lettuce salad. I love burrata, but I don't like cooked carrots due to the texture and the sweetness that comes out when heated, so I figured the salad was the best choice. It looked nice and simple. Unfortunately, when I saw it, it had pieces of citrus in it. Maybe grapefruit? I don't like fruit in my salad or really any combination of sweet and salty. I know. I'm H to the M (high maintenance), but I wish they listed the ingredients correctly. I didn't see any avocado or caviar either. Maybe this was a misprint as it looks like their regular menu list these ingredients for their deviled eggs? I took two bites and didn't touch the rest of it. It was too salty and sweet.Entrees:*Petite tender roast: asparagus, carrots, red wine jus*Wild king salmon: succotash of turnips, fava beans, spring onionI was contemplating pot roast but I only like my beef rare. Turns out their pot roast starts out sous vide to a medium rare, so I decided to order the salmon. When I asked the server about the sauce for the salmon, he seemed annoyed and didn't seem to actually know. I know I just asked a bunch of questions about the pot roast, but shouldn't you know what comes with your dishes? I expressed that I didn't want the turnips and asked if I could get the salmon cooked on the medium rare side. When I got the fish, there was no sauce and the turnips were there. The fish was cooked nicely in the center, so I ate the middle and the spring onions. I had to add a bunch of salt and pepper to give it flavor since there was no sauce.Desserts:*Carrot cake*Chocolate peanut butter barI don't like chocolate or cooked carrots, so I skipped dessert. It turned out the carrot cake was listed incorrectly and everyone was offered a coconut cake instead. I know, I'm picky AF since I don't like coconut either.Looking at their regular lunch menu, it looks like they only have the roasted carrots and burrata dish on that menu, so I understand why the server may not have known all the elements of every dish we got. But his demeanor towards me was a little off putting. I won't hold that against the service as we all still had a great time. And yes, I was that annoying person asking a lot of questions, so it was probably just me.I'm most disappointed in the fact we had to do a set menu without their signature dishes. Why couldn't we try the fried chicken or the burger? Those are the things I think of when I hear Wayfare Tavern. I don't necessarily think of pot roast or salmon. I know set menus for big parties are required to make things run smoothly, but one would think the selections would be more indicative of the restaurant.Wayfare did a good job with the private room and we all had fun, but I was disappointed in the food. I hate giving Wayfare 2 stars, but I left a little hungry.

Crazy crowded with FiDi workers. Suits everywhere. Food did not disappoint, will definitely be back to try more dishes. Parking looks terrible around here...

Had the pleasure of having dinner here few weeks ago. The service, food and decor from here was great. I'm going to keep this simple and go with a bullet point style for this review...- For starters, I had the butter lettuce salad. I usually don't eat salad but this was definitely a favorite salad of mine. It had an interesting combination of tastes from avocado and mandarin oranges. - Mac & cheese. Loved the breadcrumbs, but the dish itself could have a little more flavoring since it was a little bland imo.- Organic fried chicken, yum. The serving size was hugeeee. They probably gave me a whole baby chicken or a half of a large chicken. It was nicely seasoned and they even have salt and pepper on the side for you to add if you needed a little more flavoring- Cucumber mule. I got it for the cup... but I can't complain because it tastes good.- Peach cream puffs. yumyumyummm... probably my favorite dish of the night :) I thought it would be creampuffs with peach stuffing, but it's just regular puffs laying on top of peach sauce. Regardless they were delicious! In the end, this place is great. Good food and portions...and like what our waitress said "Nobody is going to leave this table hungry...trust."

Great service and ambience. Wish the lunch menu has more choices. The fried chicken reminded me of the chicken nuggets I had at the MOMA cafe - but it was a bit dry at Wayfare. There are boneless pieces - which is nice. Lunch doesn't come with any sides though. Price is on the high side for lunch.

Came here for a firm lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised. The Deviled Eggs are a must...so full of flavor and love the bagel crumb on top. The complimentary bread they give is out of this world. It is light, airy and buttery at the same time and has a beautiful crunch. For my entree, I got the Winter Black Truffle Gnocchi which has a beautiful creamy, pillowy lemon flavor to it. I am not a huge fan of gnocchi in general since it is usually not that well-made but this was executed to perfection. Finally, I got the City Salad to share. It was a nice balance to the gnocchi as it was light and refreshing. The ambiance was also amazing. We got this room upstairs that looked like a rustic library. Absolutely adore the decor!Must try!

We decided to eat here after hearing about the fried chicken. Heck, who can say they have the best fried chicken and really stand up to that especially if it comes from Food and Wine Magazine? We made a 12:30 reservation but were early by almost and hour and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. No problem seating us and providing truly wonderful service. Four of the five ordered cocktails that were all perfectly made and served with panache. The real hero were the popovers which were light, buttery and fantastic. We ordered the fried chicken and burger and low and behold, it was the best fried chicken we have ever had - no kidding. An herb-y delight with layers and layers of flavor. The chicken was moist and perfect. I'll be dreaming of it for weeks. The burger was very good as well - a custom blend (probably brisket and chuck) that had a deep smoky savoriness and a wonderful bun. All the sides were perfect and the restaurant deserves the accolades it receives in the press and on Yelp Don't forget about the donuts for desert. They are pretty amazing and not really a donut but instead a fluffy light cake. It is a bit pricey but this is SF so we expect some of that. No one felt that we didn't get a very good value for our dollar. Kudos again to the staff for providing a memorable experience.

The only reason I am not giving them 5 is because the chairs at the chef counter are small and uncomfortable. Had I known I would have requested a table. Also our waiter while good just didn't smile or seem very personable. The deviled eggs were amazing as was the fried chicken. Got a bite of my friends tartare and of course also amazing. Would definitely go back.

Beef Tartare was different than traditional, but good with a rich, organic egg yolk. The homemade chips were awesome. Deviled eggs were a little bland, but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. We had to try the "Best Fried Chicken" in America...not sure if it's the best, but it was damn good. Service was good.

Really enjoy the ambience of this place, sleek, modern, not too loud so you can easily have conversations if you sit in a booth. The pop overs were warm and fresh, just melts in your mouth along w the room temp butter I spread on it. Ordered the fried chicken which was juicy, perfectly crispy, and I love their recommendation of squeezing lemon on it. So delicious! Also had the Mac n cheese which was decent, but nothing memorable. My husband had the wild mushroom rotolo which was the winner that night! Very flavorful, had the right amount of mushrooms and cream sauce, and presentation was impressive!The service was amazing too, our server was attentive and patient w us since we requested 7 separate checks. This place is great for work or casual dinner!
