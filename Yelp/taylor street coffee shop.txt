Updated review
We came here on a Sunday around 11, long line outside but we were seated in about 40 minutes. It was well worth the wait ! Had a cup of coffee, excellent coffee. I ordered the black stone - which is eggs Benedict and their millionaire bacon. My only complaint was that my eggs were slightly overcooked, but even with that the flavor was amazing! The bacon is definitely worth trying. If my eggs would have been cooked a little less it would of been a 5 star review. None the less , make this a stop when I'm SF looking for breakfast Changed review to a 5 Star because of the excellent customer service !

This place is the same owner as Kitchen Story, Sweet Maple, Surisan, Blackwood, etc. --you know, the best brunch spots in town. So no doubt I knew the food was going to be on par. I arrived at 11am on a Saturday and there was a line out the door. I took a peep inside and it's literally just a hallway with about 10 tables. Do not come here with more than 4 people, please.The line took a good 45 minutes until we were finally seated for three. I was feeling a burger, so ordered the Sunnyside Burger with mixed greens ($15). The burger was huge and fulfilling, but I think the meat could've had more flavor and more juicy. It's a pretty standard burger and nicely created between brioche buns, but nothing that wowed me. I had a taste of the Hollandaise Hash ($16), which was pretty good. They top your hashbrowns with various ingredients into a well-rounded breakfast dish.Overall, food is good. Personally, I hated the small space despite how neat it was to watch the kitchen process as I was in a single-filed line. It props up a kitchen and safety hazard in my head in such a cramped up space. Honestly, go to any of their other locations instead. There will always be a wait, but at least the ambiance is nicer and food is presented nicer. There's also many more options at the other locations.Also, kind of strange to named a place with "coffee" in its name, yet not quite known for their coffee. I don't think I noticed a single person that ordered coffee here.

Last day in SF and came across this tiny gem! We stood in line for about 20-30 minutes, which gave us enough time to look over the menu that was framed on the wall. By the time we were seated, we were ready to rock and roll. I ordered the BEC with an over medium egg instead of scrambled. I can't remember what my bf ordered but it was a melt with chicken sausage AND THAT WAS DELISHHHHH. The wraps came with fruit salad but I wasn't much of a fan of the dressing. Both wraps were amazing, a bit on the pricey side but that's expected in the city.

I was a fan of this place. Came here on Monday around 8:15am but had to wait quite some time before we were seated so I recommend you get there as early as possible. SFers seem to be more of the early bird types than the LAers. Also, this was Memorial day Monday. The space inside is TINY so the line grows quicker than they can handle. It was cool to see their kitchen going full force though, they are clearly very efficient. Everything sounds amazing but hubs and I ended up getting an omelette, the sailor's hash and the millionaire's bacon. Overall, I thought this was sligthly above average but not the BEST most amazing place ever. There was initially a small mishap with my order because the waitress put down "Taylor's has" versus Sailor's. Correcting that took a good 20 minutes so my husband and I were sharing his one dish for a while. I must say though that in my dish the crab in the Sailor's hash was nice and fresh. Another outstanding item too was the fresh fruit and the jam they had there. Everything else was pretty comparable to any decent brunch place elsewhere. I took one star off because of the pricing, think even for SF it's pretty pricey at $18 for a breakfast dish.

This is a hole in a wall restaurant that is luckily near lots of hostels and walking distance from a hotel. It's very popular and you have to get there early or else be prepared to wait! My boyfriend and I had to wait a good 30 minutes for a seat due to the limited seating, but it was worth it. Taylor Street Coffee Shop is known for their signature hash. I got a Sailor's Hash $19, but the portion was huge. If you get any of their dishes, I feel like you can easily feed two people.The Sailor's Hash had shrimp, an omelet, pieces of toast, and salmon. I didn't care for the smoked salmon, but the shrimp and omelet was good. My boyfriend got the California omelet which tasted okay. I really liked my Sailor's Hash better.

Had a blast at this place. The food is amazing you gotta try the bacon and the fresh orange juice. The staff is super friendly and always trying to get you seated as fast as possible. There is always a huge line so it usually takes 30 minutes until you get your food but it's totally worth the wait.

It's a cute little place on Taylor street (obviously). It's a little stuffy towards the front since that's where the kitchen is, so try to sit more towards the back. Otherwise the food and service was great. My primavera omelette combo was delicious. Would definitely go back.

It was delicious and most important the staff was awesome! As crazy busy as they were, they had time to make sure everything was good, refill my coffee at least twice (don't judge) and get me 2 meals, since I wasn't crazy about the first! I had no idea what Benedict eggs were, and now I know soft eggs are not my fav. Food was incredible. Don't be put off by the line, it went fast and was worth it!

WORTH THE WAIT FOR MILLION DOLLAR BACON!This place is around the corner from our hotel room. The place had good reviews and the food in the pictures so we decided to stop by. VERY small location but they work with what they have. With that being said it can be a very long wait. Wouldn't recommend for very large parties. We got the Taylor hash and subbed for the million dollar bacon. OMG my tastebuds were signing. My company got the black stone Benedict which was superb and I shared the corn flake crunch French toast. Would highly recommend sharing for a little sweetness. I got The coffee and it was just ok. Nothing great so I'm going somewhere else for some.

Maybe it's because we're from NYC, but we were completely underwhelmed! Came here due to the reviews on google, but when we walked in it was super hot. The door was open but no air came through--okay I can deal. So we waited for a second and got a table, sat down and reviewed the menu. I ordered the spinach and cheddar scrambler and my boyfriend got the citrus French toast. My scrambler was okay. I guess it was what it was, hash browns were dry. Stephen's French toast was very bland! I couldn't taste any citrus in it and the bread was super soft, not in a good way. It says it's a coffee shop, but the coffee was typical diner coffee....I understand San Fran is expensive but I tend to prefer prices matching with quality. What a downer, I don't recommend. Again, living in NYC makes us a bit privileged with the array of flavors, but I expected to be slightly happy, at the least!

I am a breakfast person. No, let me rephrase... I am an everything at anytime kind of person. However, I am not an American breakfast kind of gal. I am not a fan of bacon, eggs are boring, and pancakes are tiring.But one needs fuel and the breakfast spot was close to the hotel so BF and I stopped by.I had no expectations, and I am glad I did because it turned to be excellent.I ordered the SAILORS HASH.If you like hash browns, and you like crab and you like eggs and you like cheese and you have good taste in food, get this!The food was solid. Good flavor, good crab bite, slight bit of spice from jalapeno, and nice smoked salmon on top. In my opinion, this is the best breakfast plate I have ever ate. On the other side of the table, my partner got the Swedish pancakes with the millionaire bacon. He thoroughly enjoyed his pancakes and his bacon.Overall, I would definitely come here again if I was staying in SF.The place is small so come early in the morning to grab a seat.

If you're looking for the cutest hole-in-the-wall breakfast place, this is the place to be. TSCS is probably the definition of hole-in-the-wall, and like other reviews state, it truly is a hidden gem in this city! There was a pretty lengthy line when we got there that came out the door, but considering the small size of the place, it seemed pretty standard to have to wait a bit. I highly suggest waiting it out because the food is so worth it.My family ordered: spinach cheddar scramble with hash brown, the hollandaise omelet (one of the chef's specials), the toast with the cornflakes crust, and the Californian omelet. Plus we got the freshly squeezed orange juice. The portion sizes are pretty big and all of the plates came with a strawberry and wedge of orange. For those four plates and two cups of OJ, we paid a little more than $90 (including tip). Definitely pretty pricey but well worth the money in my opinion.Service is quick and straight to the point. The place is mainly for pairs of groups of max four - I really don't see how they'd accommodate for larger groups and you'd probably have to wait a long time so just stick to one breakfast/lunch partner and you should be good! Highly recommend if you're in the area!

Little gem near Tenderloin. I liked its authenticity and coziness. Like the other reviews say, it is very small and there is usually a line from 8am throughout most of the morning. We arrived around 8 and waited in line for roughly 30 minutes max, it was out the door. We both had two different types of the breakfast hash, both very good, portions are large. We did have the millionare's bacon, it wasnt really my thing, a little too spicy for me but my husband couldn't get enough of it. Staff pleasant and accommodating, food came out quickly. Great spot. I would not recommend for large groups.

This place is worth the wait! It's a little hole in the wall joint that can be difficult to find, but once you do expect a line. ***I suggest while you wait in line, grab a look at the menu and plan what you can order so you can get the food fast and fresh.***After seeing so many food pictures, the Sailor's hash got my attention. Seafood for breakfast? That could be a stretch, but give it a try! When the dish came out, you can immediately smell the explosion of flavors hitting your face. They even created a salmon Rose which was extremely moist and fresh. From the shrimp, to the hashbrowns, and all of the seafood, this dish was perfect in a combination of different flavors in one bite. Easily a 5/5 dish, from presentation, to smell, to how amazing it taste without any additional seasoning or sauces!

Go early or you'll stand in a line like moocow. Obviously the millionaire bacon was delicious. Would be better if they had more tables but that's the way the cookie crumbles. If you have time try and get out of downtown for breakfast.. if you can't this is a solid choice. Pricey though.

After unsuccessfully visiting Taylor Street Coffee Shop on my last visit to SF, I decided to bring my friends this time. Perfect since we wanted to grab sweet potato lattes from Joy's Place & had to return our car rental down the block from the coffee shop.After debating heavily on what to get, I finally settled for the crab omelette w/ a side of fresh fruit & whole wheat bread (I know... a bit on the healthier side). The omelette was wholesome & delicious w/ chunks of crab meat, onions, cheese & tomatoes. And adding their hot sauce ketchup, deliciousssss! Plus, the fresh fruit was worth the extra cost (bananas, strawberries, cantaloupe, oranges, etc. & they did not kid about fresh!).My friends got the sailor hash & the Taylor hash. Both were pretty dope. All the flavor was there. Large portions. Great hearty dishes to satisfy a hungry hippo.Casual. Low key setting. Great for breakfast & a must in the downtown area!

I've been here many times, but I finally decided to write a review. This is probably one of the greatest hidden gems of San Francisco. It isn't located in the best of neighborhoods (well, that's the Tenderloin for you...) but the food is so delicious that you really should make the effort to come here.The orange juice is really fresh, and I really love their scramble/hash combos. If you're on a budget, I strongly recommend "South of the Border", but otherwise the "Sailor's Hash" is my definite #1 item. Prices are high, but portions are large, and they have fresh compote for buttering your toast. If you feel the need to be healthy, you can substitute hash for fresh fruit, which is delicious. Orange juice is also very fresh, albeit a little pricey.

Ok.. I guess when you are in the US, you have to try the most American thing: bacon. And of course it is branded, and of course it is award-winning. I'm talking about the Millionaire's Bacon. Is it good? Yes! Its an improved version of bacon, sweeter, fatter, spicier. Is it the best thing in the world? Worthy of that premium? Not sure. I definitely enjoyed it, but I guess I wouldn't be able to come here regularly due to the price. Overall it was a great breakfast experience, and I even had to skip lunch because I was too full.

The epitome of an excellent hole in the wall -- Taylor Street Coffee Shop is a thin sliver of a restaurant with their kitchen in the front and seating in the back. There is usually a line, but I've always felt that it moves pretty darn fast, probably because the clientele isn't prone to lingering but enjoying delicious food and being on their way. The service is super snappy but still friendly and very attentive, so that really contributes to the high turn around rate. However, it's the food here that keeps me coming back again and again (especially the morning after jumping around at Ruby Skye). Any of their scrambles are delicious, but I'm definitely a sucker for their Sailors Hash which has crab meat in it. The habanero onion that comes with some dishes is very spicy, but delicious at the same time and really makes me wish I could tolerate spicy food. :( The millionaire's bacon seems to be their trademark menu item and it's a thick slab of what is essentially bacon candy -- smokey, sweet, sticky, and a little addicting. Finish off your meal with their fresh OJ that's squeezed in the backroom and you'll be one happy camper ^_^

It's an ok diner. Got the taylors hash and pancakes with a side of millionaire bacon. Nothing crazy delicious but it wasn't bad. I give it 3 stars because it's pretty damn expensive. For those two dishes, it came out to $37 without tip. I wouldn't come back because the food quality doesn't justify the price.

Cute little hallway/hole in the wall place. I found it on yelp and it was within walking distance to my hotel. I happened to get there right as someone was leaving so I got seated right away (and then the people started showing up). Not that many places to sit, but it's all good. Staff is friendly, cooks hustle to get the food out and you can watch them cook. I got the french toast with fresh fruit, which was filling. Definitely something to get while your there. Quick to get you your food, and your check, as they're trying to turn over service. Good place to go

This breakfast spot was rated the best in San Fran and for good reason. First of all, it was not touristy at all, all locals. Don't get turned off by the line outside the door, because it moves super quick. There are only a few tables inside, but service is fast. Everything my husband and I ordered was delicious! We tried the super thin Swedish pancakes (to die for), the breakfast melts and the Greek Yogurt fruit bowl. The pancakes were almost a cross between a crepe and a pancake. The yogurt bowl is filled with super fresh fruit and the best granola I have ever had. Definitely worth the wait! We stayed in San Fran for two days, and went back for breakfast each day.

We enjoyed the Taylor hash and the millionaire bacon. Service was decent and friendly.

Found this little gem on Yelp - after reading a number of reviews, we kind of knew what to expect. In a nutshell - definitely a wait (30-90minutes), tiny spaces (they only have seating for maybe 20 people), very expensive (the prices you see online or in the pictures are outdated), but most importantly - FANTASTIC food.It was a Sunday morning at the end of July and our second day in San Fran. We got up super early to get ready for a full day ahead of us, and walked over to Taylor Street Coffee Shop - arriving at around 8:20am. We got a bit lucky I think, as the line wasn't quite out the door yet as we arrived. We were just hovering the doorway. In my opinion, it was not an efficient way for people to wait in line - it was a single file against the wall, because it's right where the kitchen is blocked off. Every time someone left, they have to squeeze their way through the very tiny walkway, and unsurprisingly - there are always the inconsiderate jerks who think it's perfectly ok to put their giant backpacks on as they walk out while bumping into other people's faces - as opposed to just walking out carrying them in their hands.Anyway, we waited about 30 minutes because a table of 4 opened up and so the family of four behind us went ahead of us (perfectly reasonable). Once seated, we both ordered right away since we had plenty of time to study the menu while waiting. We started with the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice ($6/glass) - can't say it was well worth the price, but they were definitely very fresh and delicious. We split the millionaire's bacon - as featured on "United States of Bacon" of Discovery Network. Thick, free range bacon, baked with brown sugar, Cayenne, red and black pepper. I think it was $8.50 - we liked it, but wouldn't order it again. We both felt that it was a bit overrated, but perhaps that's because we get our own free range bacon from friends who raise pigs themselves. I got the crab omelet which came with these pickled habanero onions. Now, I can eat very spicy - but I don't think I would have enjoyed eating that omelet if it were any spicier - that's how spicy it was! Hubby got the hombre omelet, which was basically a meatlover's omelet (bacon, ham and sausage). We ate everything on our plates and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the final bill was somewhere in the $80s after taxes and tip etc. Definitely NOT cheap or reasonable by any means for a breakfast joint, but when in Rome (or San Fran), I guess that's the norm!Would we go back regularly if we lived in the area? Nope, not unless we made boatloads of money. But would we go back should we find ourselves visiting San Fran and in the Union Square area again? You betcha!

The people who run this place are hardworking, attentive and efficient. With the physical limitations of the place, they have to be. The food is good and once you are seated, the service is fast.The restaurant is just about 10 feet wide, period. There are 4 tables that can seat up to 4 and, maybe, 6 or 8 duces. We stood in line to get seated for about 50 minutes and most of that time was right in front of the kitchen portion of the restaurant with all the heat generated from the grill, etc. Might be a bonus on cold winter days but it was sweat inducing in September. And once seated, there is no air conditioning or even a fan to bring in some cooler air.The other reason that this place only rates 3 stars is that (if you're a SF resident, stop reading now and move to your safe space) there are plenty of people living in SF that believe in tolerance but only some that are truly considerate of those around them. The owners of Taylor Street Coffee Shop would do themselves and their patrons a great service by encouraging those who have finished their meals to give up their tables and hold their book club meetings elsewhere.

Worth the wait! We waited in line about 30-40 mins on a Saturday morning at 10:30. Once we sat down, our order was taken soon after and the food came quickly. The hash browns were especially delicious! Only negative part of the experience is it was hot in the restaurant, which was fine when we sat down, but was tough while we were waiting in line. But the good food made it worth it!

This is such a cute place to get breakfast at. It was very convenient for my boyfriend and Isince we were staying at the Mark Twain hotel which was right next door :) I heard this place gets packed so I'm glad we were able to wake up early and get a seat. I tried their chicken mango sausage and it was quite tasty! I wish they gave more than two. The hash browns were decent, but I loved the jam! I don't eat red meat or pork but I made my boyfriend try the Millionaire's bacon because everyone talked about it! He enjoyed it :)Maybe next time I'll try something a bit more extravagant; such as one of their hash's or Benedict's - just without the bacon.

The millionaires bacon was delicious! I had the Salmon Benedict and my husband an omelette. Friendly staff with delicious food. Truly a hole in a wall! It was our first time visiting and we adored it. The only downside is waiting to get a table which took about 15-20 minutes (don't come too hungry) since they have very few tables. If you're in the area or visiting I would definitely recommend checking it out.

The wait was about twenty minutes but it was steadily moving. It's a small place but comfortable. The food was amazing. We ate a very hearty breakfast and left satisfied.

Really not special. $20 breakfast for 2 eggs, toast, 2 slices of thickcut "millionaire" bacon, and hashbrowns. On the menu, there are many Chef's specials featuring hashbrowns topped with various things. So you'd think the hashbrowns are special too. They are not. Lightly toasted on one side, no toasting on the other. Places is dirty too, and the small size and apparent overatings of this place can mean a long line. Not worth the wait, but okay for a quick bite if nearby and there is no wait.

We kept seeing long lines for this place, and woke up early to see what the fuss was all about. Waited in line for maybe 15 minutes, before being seated at one of only a handful of tables. We each had an omlette and coffee, and the bill with tip was $50 for two. Pretty pricey for an ok breakfast. The food was good and fresh but not particularly great. The coffee was meh. We concluded that there's a line because the place is small, and people seem to love a line.

This place is good...just good. Seating is tight, but waiting line moves fairly quick. Food is good but pretty expensive for common breakfast foods...with a few exceptional exceptions like the millionaires bacon.

Stopped by for quick breakfast. Shareable items (for low appetite people) Tried their famous hash browns with cheese and vegetable toppings - comes with a side 2 eggs (scrambled or fried) and bread toast and couple of fresh strawberries. Was a lot for the breakfast (it was actually 2 varieties in one) . Enjoyed the hashbrowns. Egg benedicts - with spinach, tomato and avacado. Comes with a side of hashbrown and tiny little strawberry. Again delicious but huge quantity.

I was looking for a coffee/breakfast spot close to the hotel, and this is a little gem I discovered. It is a little pricey (that's the reason for the 4 stars), but portions made up for cost. Service was on point, and that's largely due to the fact this place only has about 10-12 tables, so wait staff can survey customer needs in about a millisecond. I had coffee and the Blackstone Benedict. Millionaire bacon is NOT traditional bacon, it is thicker, sweeter, and less crispy; HOWEVER, it is divine! The line was out the door and stayed that way. Worth the wait

To be fair, the omelettes are pretty good. The millionaire bacon is way overrated; it's too chewy and sweet with not enough smoky bacon flavor. The real reason for the one star though is the horrific food poisoning I got from the hollandaise sauce in the eggs Benedict, which was bland and disappointing,and a few hours later resulted in three solid days of violent stomach cramps and all the rest of the colorful side effects that accompany a salmonella infection.Also, the place has horrifically long lines and is super cramped, probably mostly because finding any decent breakfast in this part of SF is pretty difficult.(edited because spelling on mobile is hard)

Had a great breakfast this morning, tiny place...they opened at 7:00and we arrived by 7:30 to get a table for 5. Line started just after that:) I had the Sailor's hash...it was great! Terrific flavor and not something I would usually pick. Loved it! The only complaint was 18% gratuity was added to our bill and if I didn't notice it I would have over-tipped because once the credit card was run it still had a spot for tip! I thought the waitress should have pointed out when she brought the bill a tip had been added, I feel 18% is enough but I might have appreciated her honesty and tipped more.

Great breakfast spot but expect to wait if it's at the standard breakfast hour. It's an adorable long hallway of a spot. I had a classic breakfast sandwich that was good but nothing over the top to write home about. Location is awesome and the staff was wonderful.

This place was literally down the street from our super hipster, right-on-the-border-of-the-loin, hotel. Combined with its fab yelp rating and close proximity to our home away from home, it was a natural choice for breakfast. We were early, which is good (but not quite good enough- we still waited in line!) so our party of 4 crammed against the super slim hallway? Entry? Foyer? Whatever it was till we were seated. The venue is teeny but turnover is quick. It was like finely composed music watching the staff work in unison. Their space is just as slim as the hall/entry/foyer, so they had to work really well together, almost assembly style. It was great. So was the food. The million dollar bacon really leaves an impression in my memory. It's generously cut, and the perfect mix of sweet, carmelized, salty and crisp. While I don't recall the other plates ordered, I do remember everything was tasty. Yum in my tum.

Worth the wait as the line moves fast and the food was well worth it. As advertised the millionaire bacon is just the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. My Classic Eggs Benedict was good, but I didn't finish it and found myself spending the majority of my efforts on finishing the bacon, fresh fruit and orange juice - all of which are items I hope order again!

I AM IN LOVE....My favorite breakfast place in San Francisco!! Read the reviews and thought I'd try it out. OMG I WAS BLOWN AWAY!! The food was amazing! From the Swedish pancakes, the millionaire bacon to the delicious Orange Marmalade, everything was full of flavor. A bit pricey but so well worth the money. Will definitely eat here again when I am back in town from Palm Beach Florida.

So flippin delicious!!! We had the crunch French toast, millionaire bacon and the hash with the halbenero infused onion. Oh my gosh those onions were ridiculously good and perfectly spicy. Be prepared to wait in line to be seated, but definitely worth the wait!

Wow Millionaires Bacon is like a salty, spicy, sweet explosion! And it's thick, need to cut it with a knife and fork. Everything else is good too hasbrowns, eggs, fresh squeezed OJ. I got there at 7:03am and sat right down. 10 mins later there was a line out the door.

Came here on a Sunday right before noon. Right when you walk in it looks like a small hallway, with a single file line of people.. So we just stood there assuming it was the line. Good thing it was! Waited about 20 minutes.. They asked if we were ok with our party sitting at two different tables next to each other (more like back to back so we didn't get to talk to the homies at the other table much). The entire place is a tight squeeze. By the time we left the line was even longer. So many delicious sounding options! I am sad I could only chose one dish.. (Wouldn't be able to finish 2 or come back to try other dishes since I don't live here) The Pacifica omelet with shrimp & capers, so yummy! I cleared the plate easily. But who has heard of the $7.50 bacon? Yes please! So worth it, a must. Loved this place, but I'm also biased bc I came after running a half marathon starving. Being a tourist also.. I guess I was more ok with the high prices.
