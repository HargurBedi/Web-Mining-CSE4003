Be ready to stand in line for an hour. The line out front is just part of the process, unless you get there @10:30 when they open. The wait is worth it. The food is amazing. If you love seafood, this is Mecca. There is nothing new I can say about the food that hasn't already been said. But here is what really surprised me about the place. For all the waiting in line, I really expected this place to be the kind of place that rushes you in and out so they can seat the next people. It's not the case. Once you get a seat, they really let you take your time and relax. They are so welcoming and friendly. This is one of my favorite places on earth!

Love the seafood, so fresh and tasty!The wait tho was insane, but if you've got time, it's worth it.This place is definitely very old school, family run and it's very straight forward. CASH ONLY.Oysters, seafood cocktail, sashimi, all were great.

The experience was awesome but the food is hyped wayyy too much. Luckily we went early (10:20 on Friday morning) and only waited for like 20 minutes. The staff are all incredibly friendly (they're probably the best part of the experience to be honest) and the place itself is charming.The food, though. The only thing that blew me away was the Sicilian sashimi platter. But, I've definitely had comparable sashimi at my local sushi place that doesn't have bones in it. I know how to eat around bones, but that doesn't mean I want it in my sashimi, and sushi chefs know how to prep sashimi sans bones.I was told the crab back was amazing but I did not partake.The clam chowder was flavorful, but less creamy than your standard chowder.They're very accommodating to mixing and matching for cocktails. I got the crab and prawn. The prawn was plump and fresh, might've been the best I've ever had. Just a smidge better than Mastro's. The crab was ok, not amazing. To be fair, once you've had crab at a Chinese restaurant that was alive just minutes ago in a tank before being boiled and cooked with garlic, everything else pales in comparison.If you're not going at 10-10:30, I wouldn't recommend going. I know it has the Bourdain seal of approval but it's not worth a 1 hour wait.

Swan Oyster Depot is a wonderful hole in the wall that sits roughly 15 people at a time. We (a group of 5) came around 11 am on Thursday and didn't have to wait long. We told them that we can separate into a group of 2 and 3 if it makes it easier. After about 10 minutes they told us that they can seat 3 now and the other seats will be available shortly, but we could stand around and get started with some drinks. We actually didn't have to stand around at all. The owner was kind enough to shuffle a couple people around so we were able to sit together all at once. Once we got to the counter we were greeted again and started off with some beer. After taking a look at the menu, we ordered 2 bowls of clam chowder, 3 combination seafood cocktails, 2 crab salads, a dozen little neck clams, smoked salmon, and 4 crab backs. This was the perfect amount for us and we cleaned our plates. The clam chowder is more on the runny side, but had a lot of clammy goodness! I was especially impressed by the smoked salmon. Smoked salmon tends to be salty and... salty. Not here! It had a subtle saltiness and it was extremely buttery. I've never had smoked salmon like that and I wished I didn't because it'll be hard to top going forward. The restaurant was extremely clean and I loved the atmosphere. The entire staff was friendly and accommodating. The owner made us crab back sauce to go with our crab salad. He really made sure we had everything we needed. I absolutely loved our dining experience here and will come again.

Swan Oyster Depot is a small fresh seafood restaurant. They have one row of counter seating with a narrow walkway. Since it is small, the wait is definitely long with such a popular and small locale, but I found it worth the wait. We waited 2 hours on a Saturday, arriving a little before opening. At the window of the restaurant are trays of seafood and they look delectable and fresh! The seafood here is fantastic! It's not an upscale restaurant but it seems fresh and reminiscent of a fish market. The menu is on the wall and seems pretty basic, though it helped that we looked on Yelp for tips and pictures. (They're also rather flexible on sizes that you can order. We were full and wanted to try the smoked salmon so they were able to give us a half order.)+CRAB BACK: This is delicious and I haven't had this anywhere else. They give you bread with it, which goes nicely with the seafoody and pleasant bitter flavor of the crab.+SICILIAN SASHIMI: Various types of seafood that are topped with capers and onions, and with what seems to be olive oil. This is delicious and goes so well with each of the five types of sashimi. +SCALLOP SASHIMI: We loved the scallop sashimi so much that we ordered an extra small order, and it was delicious! It's soft and similar to butter. +OYSTERS & CHERRY CLAMS: We were able to split getting half a dozen of each, and they were amazing. There's a little tray of mignonette and sauces, as well as lemons, and they were great. First time having raw clams and these were large and great!+CLAM CHOWDER: There are a good amount of clams and it's quite delicious! Great compliment to all the other cold seafood.All in all, the seafood here is quite delicious. After the meal, they asked us what we got and added it up on a napkin. Kind of seems like they take it by honor system since they just ask you what you got. Be aware that they're cash only so bring enough! We were a little sad that they ran out of uni, and there's still so much to try there (like the crab salad) so I hope to return to have their delicious seafood!

I gave this place a 4 star instead of a 5 star purely because of the wait time. We waited in line for about 1.5 hrs on a Thursday afternoon. Throughout the time of waiting in line, patrons raved about how good this place is and that it is worth the wait. Thus, my friend and I made the decision to commit to standing in this long line. Unfortunately, they did not have sea urchin the day we went. We did order oysters, clams, crab back, clam chowder, and sashimi. All so fresh and good! The sashimi was different than what I expected because I'm use to eating sashimi plain with a little wasabi and soy sauce. Overall, great seafood and staffs were very attentive. But I don't think I will stand in that long line again.As a side note, it is a small seafood restaurant. There is about 18 seats at the counter. This place should consider expanding their space as they seem to be busy all the time.

As one of the oldest seafood restaurants in SF, I can see the fuss in waiting in line for who knows how long just to experience those old school vibes - 10 stools, cash only, and seafood as fresh as they can be. We arrived at 11:45 and were discouraged when we saw a line that took up 3/4 of the block. When asking a couple of people in front of us how long the wait would be, we received shrugs and laughs as they didn't seem to care. As a hangry New Yorker, I unfortunately don't have the patience to stand in line for an hour+, especially not knowing how long I'd be waiting for. Luckily, I read that you can order take out, so I skipped the line and went to order my food to go. Ordering take out is confusing here as there's no clear place to stand to order take out. I went all the way to the back only to be told to go back to the front. Fortunately for me, someone else was placing an order to go, so he directed me to just stand behind him. FYI - it doesn't seem like people really order take out here, so just awkwardly stand next to the first stool and someone will eventually come assist you. Also, just because you're ordering take out doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be helped quicker - I waited around 20 minutes before I was acknowledged and helped (I think they felt bad for me standing there alone, as the guy before me said he waited a good 45 minutes before being helped). For two people, I ordered a medium sashimi (not listed on the board above, but it's available), a dozen mixed oysters, a cup of clam chowder, and bread and butter. All this will run you $59. I also tried to order the crab back, but they're not in season / available in August. A medium sashimi comes with 15 pieces soaked in olive oil and capers. I had no idea that sashimi can be prepared this way as I'm used to Japanese sashimi. Mind blown as this preparation was delicious. Our favorite fish was the scallop, but all the pieces were oh so tender. The oysters were probably one of the best oysters I've had as they were all sweet and large. I loved how the guy labeled each oyster for me on the plates! The clam chowder isn't your typical clam chowder as it's super watery, but definitely does not lack in flavor. I wish I had ordered a bowl instead of a cup because the guy gave us SO much bread (which was delicious btw because it's Boudin's sourdough bread - definitely worth the $1). Long story short, the food is absolutely amazing here. Yes it's pricy, but if you're coming here, you're 99% a tourist, so hey you'll be dropping $$$$ when on vacation. Go early (10:30 I read was the magical time to get first round of seating) or just order take out! There's a park nearby where you can feast with no shame.

Swan Oyster Depot is THE oyster bar in San Francisco. It's been at this location for over 100 years, so you know that they've got it down. Everything here is sooooo good, just remember to bring enough cash because you'll be tempted to try everything!! It's probably best to arrive here before they open to make sure you're one of the first ones to sit down. If you show up later, it's guaranteed that they will run out of Uni, Blue Point Oysters or the Crab Back. WAIT/LINE - Arrived here at 11am on a Saturday and the line was already pretty long. I assumed it would be around an hour or so, but we waited 2.5 hours for a group of 4. We ended up sitting separately because it was easier to seat groups of 2 than 4. OYSTERS - The first thing that I highly recommend trying is their Miyagi, Shigoku oysters. We didn't get to sample the Blue Points because they ran out. However, the Miyagi and Shigoku were both sweet and meaty. The Kumamotos were honestly not worth it. At $18 for half a dozen, they were the size of quarters. The guy gave us an extra one because of the size, but I'd rather have the larger ones instead. SASHIMI - Something that isn't on their menu is their sashimi platter. You can order a small, medium or large portion with two, three or four slices of fish respectively. The sashimi was super fresh and had yellowtail, salmon, tuna, scallops and halibut. It arrived drizzled with olive oil, topped with capers and red onions. This by far was one of my favorite things to order here.SALAD - SOD has an assortment of salads you can order from shrimp, prawns, crab and lobster. You can even opt for the combination, but I preferred sampling their crab salad. At a hefty price of $30, this salad was not cheap, but it was very delicious. The crab on the salad was not only abundant, but it was buttery and flaky at the same time. And their signature Louie Sauce was just perfection.CLAMS - Cherry stone clams on the half shell are a must-try too, half a dozen for $14. Add a little horseradish and their mignonette, and it's got quite the kick. Or eat them as is with a splash of lemon, it's very meaty and delectable. CLAM CHOWDER - Boston Clam Chowder here does not come with potatoes or clams, but it's packed with a ton of flavor. It's the perfect consistency to dip your bread in, not too heavy, it's just right. I personally prefer it this way more than anything else. If I had one bad thing to say about SOD is that the workers handled money and seafood, hand in hand. without washing their hands in between. I wish they would just wear gloves or use utensils to serve, but that's just not the case here. When I come here again in the future, I do plan on arriving earlier than I did so that I wouldn't have to wait as long. Also, I would be able to try other items before they run out. Love this place, can't wait to visit again!

Living in SF for 7 years this was my first time visiting Swan Oyster. I've always been turned away by the line, but with relatives visiting I thought we could wait and see what the hype was about. Going on a Saturday and arriving at 10:15 (which was 15 minutes before they opened) we ended up being seated at 12:30. I was trying to read prior reviews to see how long the wait would've and I was expecting closer to 1.5 hours. Was the wait worth it? Probably not, but to me no restaurant is worth an over 2 hour wait in my opinion. It's been overly hyped and is now a very popular tourist location. A review of the food:-Combination Salad: include some lettuce with shrimp, prawns, and crab meat on top. It's about 70% seafood and 30% lettuce but compared to the other dishes it was a little bland for my taste. -Clam Chowder: more on the thinner side, but definitely one of my favorite dishes. I love Seattle clam chowder, so hard to say this is better. -Sashimi platter: this was by far my favorite dish. The pictures make it look a lot bigger than the pieces are, but the flavor and capers added an extra taste that was different than a Japanese restaurant. -Kumamoto oysters: small but delicious! Last but not least CASH ONLY.

Very good seafood but I don't think it's worth a wait longer than 45 mins-1hr. Parking may be hard around here. Luckily I found parking on California with almost 2 hours of time in the meter! To feed the meter you can pay through the app which is nice.Came with a group of 4 which may be bit difficult when doing bar seating but luckily another group of 4 left when we were getting seated. We waited probably almost 1.5 hours and the time went fairly fast because we had our out of town guest to talk to. When we got near the front they offered beer or wine because of the wait (I can't be sure if it was free or not, since we didn't see the bill). I did notice that 4-5 parties left around us because of the wait and I wonder what still took so long. After being seated, we immediately got bread and got samples of the giant smoked salmon that was in front of us. We ordered crab back, a dozen assorted raw oysters, combo salad, shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail, and a full order of smoked salmon. All the food items were really good, even the crab back. This was my first time trying it and it didn't taste as strong as I thought it would. It was buttery. I liked the kumamoto the best, then I think it was called golden point, and liked the miyagi the least. The condiments also complimented the dishes well.The service was great too. They all like to banter with one another and are very friendly. Always serving more bread (which is a special recipe from Boudin only avail to very few restaurants in SF). CASH ONLY! We didn't know but luckily our guest knew and had lots of cash. Seafood isn't cheap!When we were leaving we saw a couple of parties that were ahead of us in line still eating (probably sat 15-20mins before us). Not sure if we ate really fast or what. If you don't want to wait in line but want to eat the seafood from here, I would suggest just walking in and ordering to go.

Anthony Bourdain recommended so I put it top of my list. Went on a Friday and know the reputation for lines as all they have is a small counter. Was first!!! in line by getting there 1 hour before opening (don't laugh, it worked). Great spot, great service, great fresh seafood. Had a shrimp cocktail to kick off, then my friend and I shared a dozen oysters, then fresh sashimi - scallops, salmon, tuna, etc. We got 4 more oysters and were good. Highly recommended. By the time we left, line was well down the block. Get there early or be prepared to wait a couple hours. A true SF treat!

In the last 3 years, I've visited San Francisco 3 times and have been to Swan Oyster Depot 3 times. There's a running joke with many of my friends that I'll eventually eat all the oysters in the ocean. I just love them so much. And something about Swan Oyster Depot's divey counter of seafood goodness just speaks to me. I don't know how their oysters taste so much better than anywhere else I've had, but I would like to meet their oyster man. And marry him.This was the last meal of my SF trip over Labor Day and probably the best (Gary Danko was a close second). It was Tuesday morning at 10:25 AM. They had just opened up so there wasn't a line (cue angels singing). We got 2 dozen oysters (they were out of Pacific so we got Kumamoto which were just as good), the sashimi platter (incredible), and the crab cocktail (literally ALL crab). Add 2 glasses of their house wine plus tip and the total was around $150. It definitely adds up quickly so make sure you leave yourself plenty of wiggle room. I made sure not to make the same mistake as last time when I almost didn't have enough cash and brought $300 with me juuuust in case we decided to go balls to the wall. The experience was worth every penny.Anthony Bourdain said it best: "If i died eating at Swan's counter, I would die a happy man."

Really enjoyed this oyster bar on a Wed afternoon (with no crowd and open seats!). Accept that a bar is all it is and you will enjoy it too. Some of the negative reviews talk about how dated this place is, but it kind of adds to the experience. Cash only and no menus, but there's a menu on the wall. A lady asked for a menu to take with her. The guy at the bar asked if she had a camera. She said yes and he told her to take a picture. Not sarcastically, but sincerely trying to help. She said its not the same and walked out. Really? So set your expectations accordingly and you will not be disappointed. Oysters were super fresh and tasty. The Thai hot sauce on the bar added a great kick. That and a squeeze of lemon was all I needed. Pair with some bread and a glass of Pinot Gris and I was set. Also tried the clam chowder. It was on the soupy side, but tasty. More potatoes than clams though. But still good. I'd recommend and I will return.

Hello Anthony Bourdain!So I arrived about 15 minutes before opening. My party of two was sat about 45 minutes after opening during the second rotation. I ordered almost everything on the menu...Chowder Crab back Sicilian carpaccio (off menu)A dzn assorted oystersAssorted cocktail Fresh uniEverything tasted as expected. It was cool to try once, but I wouldn't wait for it again. The service was beyond slow. They can increase their amount of turnovers but they work at a sluggish pace. I guess it is all a part of the experience.

If you can't make it on a weekday, you better bring some DAMN good company to accompany you for the inevitably excruciatingly long line during the weekend. My boyfriend and I arrived 10 minutes before opening on a Saturday, and we still waited nearly 2 hours. I was pretty hangry by the time I got to the front, but as you can probably tell from my 4 stars, the food made it difficult to stay unhappy (though by no means would I ever go back again on a weekend).With the amount of time we waited, we knew exactly what we wanted to order and were ready to feast by the time we sat down:- Half dozen oysters: We had 3 different varieties. I know one type was from Tomales Bay, but I don't remember the others. Doesn't matter though because they were all AMAZING. Some of the best oysters I've had in SF, by far.- Large Sicilian sashimi: This was the most expensive dish ($32), but I thought it was well worth it. The red onions, capers, and olive oil was unique but complimented the fish really nicely. And all the fish (ahi tuna, salmon, scallops, & yellowtail) was very fresh.- Combination cocktail: Came with crab, shrimp, prawn, and oysters. I recommend putting some of the crab into the crab back and eating it with the bread!- Crab back: For $6, you get all the delicious soupy guts and fat from the crab, served up with bread to soak it all up. Important to note that it's cold, but it still tastes great.- Combination seafood salad: This was kind of an attempt to get some fiber in our meal, but we were impressed with the large amount of seafood that came with it. Included shrimp, prawns, crab, and crawfish. Highly recommend getting it with the louie dressing.- Uni: I know they don't always have this, so we were lucky! Not the best uni I've had (Hokkaido uni lovers, you know what I'm talking about), but super fresh and rich.Hard to pick one favorite because all of them were so good, but the oysters and sashimi were probably the most memorable for me, if I had to pick. Not a cheap meal, but absolutely worth the money.Service was very friendly and efficient too! I may be back...though probably not on a weekend.

One of the smallest restaurants we went to, which only seats twenty or so people. The Sicilian-style sashimi is different than what I'm used to, but I really liked it! The scallops were probably my favorite part of it. This dish is off-the-menu but it's very popular! It's not good for big crowds, so a party of 1-2 would probably be ideal.

Took an hour to get seated but the wait was well worth it. We got the Assorted Dozen Oyster with local Miyagi, Shigoyu, and something else. Miyagi tasted slightly saltier but there's more of the seafood flavor, whereas the Shigoyu was very meaty. All three of them were great but I'd prefer the Shigoyu. We also got the sashimi (comes in 3 sizes, $16, $26, $32), the half cracked crab, combination cocktail, and some clam chowder for about $55 per person. I'd come back any day for a taste of heaven.

Judging by the three parties ahead of us at 2:30pm, midweek, I assume there isn't a day or time when Swan Oyster Depot doesn't have a line. We spent our 20-minute wait doing what passersby do -- ogling the window display of their daily offerings. This Polk Street eatery has 20 coveted counter seats, putting you in the thick of all the action: smoked salmon being sliced off the skin in front of you; sea urchin expertly cleaned & prepped; five workers constantly hustling to deliver orders & checking to make sure "you're all set." We ordered crab and prawn cocktails, both fresh & plump but also both lacking a sweetness I've come to expect of San Francisco seafood. Disappointed that their clam chowder had a watery consistency; creamy butteriness was non existent. Smoked salmon was no better, no worse than any other place. Absolutely middle of the road (though their sourdough, which comes from Boudin, is phenomenal.) $58 (not including tip) for the meal & two sodas. Cash only. Swan Oyster Depot has that old school charm that SF restaurants over a certain age possess; plus they've got Anthony Bourdain's endorsement which is no small feat. The experience & atmosphere is fantastic, as far as authentic seafood markets go. Their food is no frills, probably done the way it's always been done; I'm looking for a couple more bells & whistles.

I do love Swan Oyster Depot, but I will probably NEVER come back. In order to not wait 1-2 hours, you literally have to eat raw seafood at 10:30am....not the worst thing ever, but still a little too early for my taste. I just really hate waiting and in SF, you wait for everything.They open at 10:30am and my bf and I got there at 10am. There was no one lined up outside yet, so we were the first ones there, but literally ~2 minutes later....BAM.....the line begins and does not end. I feel bad for the folks that just miss the first seating (18 stools in the restaurant only) because if you miss the first seating, you'll wait at least 45 minutes until people finish up / pay / leave. I liked being the first ones in because you sit near the end where all the shucking and sashimi cutting action is!I love the family feel you get from everyone working. They joke with each other and you see them constantly laughing. They really treat the folks eating like family as well. Although there is a long line, they never rush you and actually told me to take my time finishing up my beer before leaving. One thing to note, if you're a germaphobe then you might get a little grossed out that they handle things there with their bare hands.Food:- Oysters: get the combo so you can try them all....the blue points are creamy deliciousness and kumamoto oysters are always a fan fave. They had 2 different kumamoto's in the combo platter and one was so small and cute.- Uni: oh man.....this was like heaven.....- Crab Cocktail: they give you large chunks of crab!- Scallops in Ponzu: this was one of my fave things we ordered....it was light and fresh and oh so delish :)- Smoke Salmon (cold): GET THIS!!! We really weren't going to get this because 1. we were stuffed and 2. smoked salmon is whatevers to me, but a local stopping in to say hi to everyone working told us that if we went to Swan Oyster and didn't get the smoked salmon, then we didn't get the whole Swan Oyster experience. I am SO GLAD we listened because it was REALLY good. We got a small plate and contemplated getting a half order on top of that because it was THAT good, but we were so stuffed.TIP(S): Call at 10am and place a take-out order! If you do eat there then know you don't have to get the full size of things, you can do quarter / half orders.CASH ONLY!!! There is a Chase ATM across the street.

I'll just start off by saying... The line is worth it!We waited about 1 hour. The line was shorter than it usually is (so we heard).It is a bit chaotic once you've sat down but understandable given the demand. Patience is needed on your part.It took a while for them to clean the counter and realize we haven't ordered yet.We tried the dungess crab salad, oysters, salmon and scallops.-The dungess crab salad is literally the crab and chopped up lettuce. I would've like some more on it but... it was still good.-The salmon and scallops had oil, kapers, and onions. The scallops ... were ... DELICIOUS!? It practically melted in our mouths.-We ordered half a dozen oysters but never got them and cancelled. So one of the guys gave us 2 just for the heck of it. And I'll say ... these were the most fresh tasting oysters I've ever had. They were cold and had such a refreshing taste.

There's no better place for fresh oysters, crab, lobster, etc in San Francisco or maybe on the west coast. The place is tiny, and the line outside can be long but it's worth the wait. The activity behind the counter is always fun & interesting so it's almost like having dinner & a show. Bring cash & an empty stomach.

Over-hyped. I'm sorry to be Mr. Negative here but the employees were very rude to us today. We came here very excited to try the seafood since there were so much positive reviews from Yelp. Sadly, service is worth just as much as the quality and flavor of the food.We arrived 40 mins before they closed and there were 3 stools available (enough for our party) but 3 of their employees repeatedly kept informing us with a rude tone that the bar was closed for seating and they were only available for taking orders.Ok, so we were fine with taking our food to-go but no need for the attitude! Additionally, we noticed how the employees were practicing UNSANITARY methods of handling food. From touching money and the grabbing seafood from their ice tray in the front of the store with their BARE HANDS! Gross. Thank you but I will take my money and appetite somewhere else. The chowder wasn't very good either (was curdling) & the uni had a very off-putting bitter flavor. As for the seafood combo cocktail, it had a fishy flavor that I wasn't fond of. Good waste of $50. They didn't even say "thank you" or "have a good day" after giving me my to-go bag. I felt like they just wanted us to leave. At least I didn't have to tip them for such awful service.

I already started eating but this is the crab cocktail, for take-out, $16. It's delicious & awesome just like all the reviews. The take-out line is to the left and the sit-down line to the right. I came on a Saturday a little before noon & gave up on the sit-down line after waiting for an hour... joined the take-out line and there was one person ahead of me.

Another trip to Swan, another perfect afternoon. Showed up around 2:30 on a Friday for a late lunch and the wait was less than 15 min. Heaven. It's torture waiting in that line when you're super hungry and seeing everyone enjoying themselves so much. :)Anyway, I brought a friend that hadn't been to Swan before and naturally he was blown away with the nostalgia and coolness of the staff. We ordered my usual order: dungeness crab cocktail, sicilian sashimi, west coast little necks, oysters and the smoked salmon. Let's chat about the smoked salmon for a moment. It's easily the best in San Francisco and reminds me of the great salmon of New York City. No joke. It's tender, soft and amazing. It goes perfectly with the crusty sourdough and I want to cry. It's a must order. See you soon Swan, real soon. :)

Yesterday was our 3rd visit to Swan Oyster Depot. It's now on the list of "must do" places whenever we visit San Francisco. We live in Brooklyn in an old school Italian neighborhood and Swan's would fit in just perfectly back home. The line wasn't too bad yesterday but we showed up early around 11:15/11:30. We ordered a feast as usual including a couple things off the official menu that we had seen people have in the past and copied! -Anchor Steam Beer-half dozen oysters -Sicilian sashimi -scallops ("eggs") in a ponzu sauce with siracha-crab cocktail-bread and butterOur particular server was pleasant but seemed to stay at the other end of the bar from us so not that attentive but one of the other guys we remember from prior visits was really awesome and funny and attentive. We weren't sure if they pool tips but ended up asking him a few things and he was terrific and we had a great conversation when we were checking out with him. There was no one working the door yesterday like in prior visits so we saw individual stools remain empty since no one was at the door shouting out available seats. That didn't seem to effect us but I felt bad if here were some individual diners in line who could have sat down much sooner! All in al didn't disappoint and of course the food was fresh and amazing! The vibe is also super welcoming and despite the long line they never make you feel rushed and tell you to take your time. We love Swan's and hope it stays around for another 100 years!

I'm sad that Anthony Bourdain did me wrong.I was watching CNN: Parts Unknown (SF edition) and Swan Oyster was one of the spots that Tony stopped by. He kept saying amazing things about it and said it was a must if you're in San Fran - you know, the typical spiel. But he usually easily convinces me and whenever I watch his show about destinations I'll be going to, I always make a note to check out those places.So my friend and I (more so me), decided to get some oysters here during our weekend trip to the City by the Bay. We first went on a Sunday afternoon, not knowing that it was closed on Sundays. But that's on me. I knew they closed at 5 pm in general, I just didn't know they weren't open everyday. Maybe that was a warning sign of what a bad experience it would be. But alas, this premonition was no match for our persistence, for we trekked all the way back there again on Monday.The place is just one long bar, that fits probably 20 people. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. Once we were, it did take a bit of time for them to clean up our area. We ordered the crab back, half a dozen oysters, and half a dozen clams. The crab back (which was GREAT) and the oysters came out quickly, but our clams were nowhere to be found. It must have gotten lost with our server because he too was nowhere to be found. After we got our crab back and oysters, he never came back to check on us. It seems he was too busy on the other end, shucking clams for everybody but us. When we were finally able to flag down a different server, we just asked for the check because we were already in a rush, after waiting 20 minutes for our non-existent clams.I guess that saying rings true - "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

My boyfriend and I were riding on the cable car for fun and I spotted this place because I remembered it was recommended on TV. Place is limited seating but luckily it wasn't busy when we came. I was excited to try this place out because I'm a big seafood lover. We tried the dozen oysters containing a variety of different kinds. I believe it was $32 for the variety of oysters for a dozen. The oysters were good. Our favorite was the smallest oyster. My boyfriend ordered a beer and he barely touched the beer he said it wasn't cold enough. They do give you some bread. My boyfriend wanted to try a cup of clam chowder. It was not good at all. It was watery and not flavorful. I was kinda disappointed with my experience here. Guess it's not for me.

Holy delicious! The line down the street is worth the wait... we promise. Once you're inside it's a totally different world- service was spectacular. Loved the "old school" / "mom and pop" feel. A must in San Francisco!

Everyone sits at a long bar to eat their food here, and the wait is (ridiculously) long, since they could maybe fit 12-16 people at a time. It's fresh, and really, really expensive. I'm not an oyster person, so I opted out of the oysters, but my group thought they were delicious. The combination salad was alright, but honestly, it was alot of filler, unremarkable lettuce. The best thing I tried here was the scallop sashimi. I never had it before, but boy was it good. It was so soft, tender, and melted in your mouth. Definitely a must get. I also tried a bit of the smoked salmon, and it was really, really good as well.

Swan Oyster Depot is seriously legit and seriously tiny. No wonder it's one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite seafood spots in the city. People start lining up before the place opens for the 15 or so seats inside, so if you miss the initial seating, you're in for a wait. Boyfriend and I came here mid-week, and the place was slammed at 11:00am. We waited about an hour before we could indulge in some simple, pure, and delicious seafood. The service is quick, friendly, and there aren't a ton of items to choose from. The oysters were fresh, and the crab back was SO good, we ate two. Nothing like dipping bread into that rich, liquid crab gold. Skip the chowder (it was broken when we had it), and stick with the day's fresh delivery. Oh yeah, they're cash only. You've been warned!

Classic San Francisco spot, and you have to get oysters. I would highly recommend coming here on a San Francisco visit for lunch or dinner. There will be a line, but it is definitely worth the wait. Wonderful, fresh seafood at a (well-known) divey spot. It's also fun to walk along Polk street after to work off all the calories!

Man, they just really know seafood here. And the variety is just astounding. Came on a random Tuesday, about 30 minutes before opening, and there was already a line. Thankfully, I was able to make it inside for the first wave. There's only a row of seats at the counter, which made it a little cramped, but it's all worth it for the product, and that product is delicious seafood.Ordered a bunch of stuff including the crab back, a small sashimi, and the crab salad. The crab back was really interesting, because I initially assumed that it would be served hot, but was actually served cold. However, if you dip a bunch of bread into that stuff, there's not much better than that salty, rich, and slightly fishy taste. Not to mention, it's pretty cheap at $6. The crab salad was really great, despite consisting mostly of a pile of iceberg lettuce. However, the dressing it came with was delicious, and they really do load up the crab in the salad. The sashimi included hamachi, salmon, and tuna, which all were great with the olive oil and capers. I really enjoyed the old-school vibe here. No website, no frills, just good, clean flavors. The people behind the counter are very knowledgeable and patient. The value is pretty solid for fresh seafood, so while you may spend a lot (our bill was about $80 for lunch), you know you're getting some of the best stuff around.Will be back for sure for their other dishes, just gotta find a time when I have enough free time to get there early enough. The quality speaks for itself, and while you might be a bit miffed at the wait, it'll all melt away once you get your hands on that seafood.

This disgusting restaurant deserves negative 5 stars if negative 5 is the lowest it can go. Best food you will find there will be a glass of wine from a bottle. This was the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. The clams were so fishy that I had to stick my fingers in my throat in order to try throw up. There is no indication in the restaurant that they only accepted cash. This is 21st century so at least have some decency to have a sign that you do not take a plastic credit card from Visa or Masters. I mean I would understand it if they did not take Amex or something. Come on, take Chase Visa at least. If not, get the fuck out forever. Worst watery clam chowder that I have tasted. They should take out the word "Boston" from the menu for the word "Boston" is being abused. Your restaurant need to be bankrupted and be vanished forever. Worst customer service that made me go crazy and swear over and over again. This ruined my day. This is the worst place in sf that I have been to. This place made me really upset for their customer service is worse than their fishy disgusting sickfood. They should be called "SickFood". I dont usually write Yelp reviews but I have the obligation to report this to Yelp911SosHelpMegetridofthisrestaurant.

I am very pleased to have finally tried this old San Franciscan establishment dated back to 1912. I was told by Natalie, one of the grandchildren of the first owners, the restaurant was bought and held in the family since 1946.Seafood is unmatched in freshness. I enjoyed a cup of clam chowder (not thick and more soupy with strong flavor of clams), medium sashimi plate, and half of dozen (3/each of Cherry stone clams and 3 kumamoto oysters). The wait is crazy even for SF standards. about 1-1.25 hours. Owner suggested arriving once they open.

Make the effort and take the time to go here. Unless you're a bigger group (4+) then I'd say try somewhere else. We went on a Thursday and waited behind about 15 people for 45 minutes. When we left about 1/1:15, there were only 5 or 6 people in line. All the reviews have it right: friendly service, delicious seafood. We each had a cold beer and seafood combination salad...although it's a tiny counter only seating, we were warmly welcomed and weren't rushed.

Swan Oyster Depot is for people who appreciate fresh seafood in its pure form, opposed to deep fried and served along French fries. If it's local fresh seafood you're looking for, get in line, make sure you packed a snack, a bottle of water and a good attitude, and be ready to enjoy some of the finest ocean delights!Things I have had during my visits here:Clam chowder: The first couple times, it was so good, I ordered more. This last trip, it was off, and not as flavorful. I'm giving them a pass because it was only this one time, and maybe someone was just light on the salt when preparing it or something. But definitely get it. It's so tasty. Crab salad: Basically just lumps and lumps of glorious crab on a bed of fresh lettuce. Like I said, this isn't where you come for gimmicks or fancy sauces. They aren't trying to hide the seafood. The crab is the star of the show, and they let it shine. Seafood cocktail: If you love all seafood, and this is your first visit, I highly suggest getting this, because you get a little taste of everything. Crab, oyster, prawns, shrimp, and I think a mussel. Like a sampler platter of almost everything they haveCrab back/fat: I finally decided to try this the last time I went, and I honestly couldn't decide whether I really liked it or just kind of liked it. First, I thought it was served warm, but it's cold. I'm not a fan of cold soups, and this reminded me of soup. However, dipping the fabulous bread into it takes it to an interesting level that I really liked. But without bread, I wouldn't want to spoon that into my mouth like a soup. Maybe you aren't even supposed to. I don't know. But I would say this definitely is not a dish for the squeamish. I will say that I dipped the lumps of crab meat from my seafood cocktail into the crab fat, and THAT was genius, if I do say so myself!Mussels: Fresh, perfect.The service is cool there, the guys behind the counter are all really nice and upbeat. They remind me of east coast people, I don't know why... maybe it's their no non-sense ways. Watching them joke around with each other and hustle back there is fun to watch.I don't need to encourage you to go to Swan Oyster Depot, the place speaks for itself!

Insane line. I thought it was gonna be the best restaurant ever. I waited 1:30 in line. The service is good, friendly Italians. The place is small. The food is ok. You can just pay in cash and in my opinion it's a really expensive restaurant. The portions are pretty small for the price. I think you pay for the experience... I was still hungry when I left...

I arrived at Swan's at 10am on a Saturday morning and still waited an hour to get seated (they open at 10:30). I'm not sure what time you have to arrive to get seated in the first seating but the weather was nice and the hour went by quickly so nbd. We got the crab back, crab cocktail, oysters, clam chowder, and sashimi. I didn't love the crab back, I think I was expecting more of a bone marrow buttery unctuousness but it was kind of like watery crab juice, so that was disappointing. The clam chowder was also more on the watery end of the spectrum and the cream was split like another reviewer noted. Would skip this next time. LOVED the sashimi, the onions and capers accentuate the flavors and it was so so good. The scallops were the best. They also have a bloody mary type drink with bud-lite instead of vodka which looked super good too. I'm not sure I would wait 3 hours to eat here but I would definitely come back. There is equally good sashimi in the city and the oysters were on par with hog island and hog island has better chowder if you don't want to wait.

The food sucks. The high star reviews are for customer service which we admit is good. But we came here thinking the food was good and it was terrible. The soup was grainy... we got the clam chowder and to describe it simply it was just flour not properly mixed with hot water. Like miso soup! But miso soup tastes better.O ya, the oyster.... THE FREAKIN OYSTER was contaminated with shell pieces so when you took a bite it you get crunchy shell bits along with it! Unsanitary. They put the water water pitcher on the table while they were serving them. Then they moved it back and put it on the same tray as fish... At the end of it all it was super expensive. Not worth it. I got your back fellow foodies. You're welcome.

This place is hella old school. No website, no menus online, no credit cards, no reservations.I was excited to try this place ever since I moved to Russian hill. I've been keeping an eye out for sea urchin for a while. I called about it and it turns out they're caught fresh at half moon bay. Some days they have it, some days they don't. To be honest, I enjoyed some of the food here. However, I'm extremely displeased with their service and shady way of doing business. I arrived around 10:20 after calling in about the sea urchin, the employee on the phone said as long as I get there before 10:30 there shouldn't be a wait. LIES. I waited about 40 minutes. The place is pretty cramped and the service is painfully slow. It'll be fast if you're a charismatic single girl or if you somehow know the people who work there.The place is certainly a hole in a wall, but the prices are definitely not hole in a wall prices. We shared two live sea urchins, a crab cocktail, prawn cocktail and the Italian sashimi platter.The cocktails were pretty tiny and the prawns only came with 6 pieces for $14. The Italian sashimi platter was interesting but I prefer Japanese sashimi. The hamachi and yellowtail was too briny for me and the fish wasn't the best quality, it tasted cheap. This was also an off menu item so the price wasn't listed. The live sea urchin was the best dish out of all, I've never had live fresh sea urchin before so this was quite an experience to say the least. The shell was still moving. The shucking wasn't consistent though. The first one was shucked quite well without any guts or gunk on the sea urchin but the second one had all this black gunk which I had to clean out myself in order to eat it. Now on to the shady and shitty service. Our waters were never filled. We had to ask for more water a few times.He forgot our second order of sea urchin. We had to remind him for another order of sea urchin. He did a poor job cleaning the second sea urchin. Each order apparently comes with bread but we only got one order of bread.It took forever to get the bill and he got someone else's bill first even though we asked before them. So what was the last straw? Our bill was miscalculated by $17 - $24. There was a party next to us where he kept flirting with the girl. They just met and she was eating lunch with her mom. She apparently went to the same highschool as our server in Oakland. They chatted up and got pretty cozy talking about underground clubs. Our server was WAY more friendly with her than he was with us. He gave her two free pieces of sashimi. He offered her more bread, kept their waters filled and asked her if she wanted more beer. On top of that, he brought out their bill first even though we asked for ours first and she was seated after we were midway through our meal yet she left before our bill even came. The billing system here is a complete scam. There's no transparency and sometimes verbally expressed with or without paperwork. I thought it was really strange when her bill was $66 yet she had a combination salad, two soups, a beer, a crab back and a dozen oysters. Just judging from the menu alone her bill was basically granted a 30% - 40% discount. But when we got our bill it was $134.. I had a feeling it was off but I gave them benefit of the doubt as I had already spent over 2 hours there including the wait and I had to leave. After I left I thought about it and realized it was definitely way off. I called back to clarify the prices and I was right - they padded our bill. Probably to cover the girl's discounted bill. It all made sense now. They exchanged numbers before she left and he gave her a bunch of postcards. What a scummy way of doing business huh? It's unfortunate not everyone is treated the same. Unless you know the employees here, forget about eating here without being robbed. On the bright side I hope I saved another poor soul from getting ripped off the way I did.TLDR- avoid unless you like getting scammed for mostly overpriced seafood

That's it. I have to keep him. The old man likes to see me squirm and get antsy when he won't tell me where he's taking me. May be a plan to take me somewhere and hope I can't find my way back? So when we strolled up to this iconic establishment, I pretty much died and thought this place must be the gate to heaven. At 10:30 am there was already a long, long line halfway down the block. I didn't care. I was so giddy about finally getting to try this place. Old man had already did his homework and knew we'd be in line for a good 2 hours! So, he took off down the street to get us some breakfast to eat while waiting. Turns out this is the thing to do. Met a nice lady in line, from Texas. It was her 2nd time there, and her husband was off getting their breakfast too. And yes, we waited a full 2 hours to get two stools at the counter that seats about 12 to 15. It really didn't feel like 2 hours because coffee. And also meeting a nice couple we were able to chat with. I certainly picked her brain about what they enjoyed on their last visit. She loved their salad. And the crab fat. As you get closer to the pearly gates, you can fawn over all of the beautiful fresh seafood displayed in the front window., and watch the men behind the counter making up dishes. This also helped me in making my decision on what to order. Was really hoping to try the crab fat, but I had overheard that they were out. I ended up getting the Crab Louie salad with dressing and cocktail sauce on the side. TONS of crab meat on this salad. So, I pretty much had a salad and crab cocktail in one dish. I also got a half dozen oysters, that were so fresh and delicious. The oysters come with two sauces, a mignonette and spicy Thai sauce. Both were excellent. I was in heaven alright! I definitely want to come back after November 5th, so I can enjoy some of that crab fat! And, I want to try the Sicilian sushi. I watched these guys preparing several plates, and my wished I had more room in my belly. Oh, and the sourdough bread they serve, is the best sourdough I can ever remember trying. Three things to remember: cash only! Don't be afraid of the wait, and you can always call in an order To-Go.P.S. I love you so much, old man! Definitely a keeper.

Food: Loved every item we ordered! Oysters are a must of course! Make sure to check if they have the assorted sashimi platter which is not on the menu. Worth the price, the scallops were my favorite of the 5 raw seafood types on the platter. Service: high quality service. You are never rushed, asked to scoot down or waiting to order your next item. These folks know what they're doing, and will take care of you. Wait: as someone who lives in the neighborhood, there is ALWAYS a wait. You just live with it. If you're at the door of the SOFA store located next door, you're looking at roughly a 1 hour wait (I timed it). When you can't wait: Go for take out! Everything on the menus is available to go, oysters included! Go up to the register right next to the door and place your order. Be respectful to the people sitting at the counter, and know what you're ordering before you get there (it's a tight squeeze). Best way to go if you're in a time crunch.

Note: cash only. Be prepared to wait in line to grab a seat at the counter of about 16 seats. My husband and I came here at noon on a Thursday and only waited about 10 minutes. Once seated, one of the friendly owners or younger guys greet you and are happy to answer any questions about the menu. Here's what we got:Dozen mixed oysters (Kumamoto, Miyagi, Blue Point,):These were all big, meaty and sweet oysters that are shucked well. I didn't find a single piece of broken shell in any of the oysters, and the classic mignonette sauce paired perfectly with each one. Crab salad:Literally a pile of crab meat on top of a pile of lettuce. Squeeze some lemon juice on top and spread some Louie sauce over the plate and you'll find yourself delighted with this light, yet largely portioned plate.Clam chowder:Probably one of the best bowls of clam chowder I've had! While I didn't think there was enough clam meat in the bowl, it was rich, creamy and tasted so good with some Boudin bread. Sea urchin:These were from Half Moon Bay, which weren't as buttery and sweet tasting as those from Santa Barbara. However, the meat is large and plentiful in each one. Smoked salmon:We sat right in front of a large piece of smoked salmon but didn't order any. However, one of the owners sliced off small pieces and handed them to us to try. OMFG. I regretted not ordering it. It is insanely delicious, buttery, smokey, and melt-in-your-mouth goodness that blew my mind. We both couldn't stop dreaming about it the rest of the day and decided that we should return to order some, which is thinly sliced and served on slices of Boudin bread. All of the employees and two owners are so incredibly friendly, upbeat, and happy to serve you. Customer service here is outstanding, which I find so rare in older establishments that refuse to expand, add more seats or upgrade in anyway. Aside from that, the seafood they select is sublime, and the way they prepare every plate is wonderful.

Review #400! Must try spot!This little gem in the city is amazing and worth the wait in the cold. Anytime you find a place with a line, you must try it right? Especially if the spot has been around since 1912! I was referred to this spot by a fellow Yeep and I'm so happy that I came here. This place is legit. I love how they do things old school and that they provide excellent service to everyone. They only have counter seating but it provides for an intimate setting. You'll notice that they collect currency from all over the world and I noticed they didn't have any Baht from Thailand. Luckily I had some in my wallet so I gave it to them to add to their collection. Being that this was my first time here, I had to order as much as I could. My eyes couldn't be bigger than my stomach. At least, that was what I was hoping for. We ordered the a dozen Clams, 1/2 dozen Oysters, a Combination Seafood Cocktail, Crab Fat with Sourdough Bread, Boston Clam Chowder and of course wine! Too bad they didn't have Uni that day! Everything was so fresh and mouth watering good. Their house hot sauce goes perfectly with the clams and oysters. I can't wait to come back here again during my next trip. Keep in mind that they keep it old school so they accept cash only. I highly recommend this spot for locals and tourist alike.

I took a weekend trip to visit San Francisco and made it a personal goal of mine to visit Swan. I was in line for about 2-3 hours unfortunately... BUT! On the plus side! You can get beers from the restaurant and drink them while you're waiting. The clam chowder, oysters, crab Louie salad, and uni were amazing!!! The crab back with the roe and innards - OMG... The wait was a bit long but I would definitely still visit again.

I really wanted to be blown away but sadly I was not. The food is fresh and nothing was bad, I just expected something a little more considering the hype. We shared the small Sicilian sashimi, cup of clam chowder, 6 raw oysters, and crab salad. The star of the meal was definitely the oysters. They were meaty and tasted very fresh. The crab salad had a generous amount of crab in the plate, however, the dish got a little old very fast. It's a lot of crab with a little bit of sauce to give it some flavor. Would recommend sharing the salad for sure! The Sicilian sashimi was thinly sliced and smaller than anticipated but it's fresh and topped with oil and capers. It's a different style of raw fish than what I'm used to but I think I prefer Japanese sashimi instead. The clam chowder was strangely liquidy and tasted more like clam broth. But it was good to dip the breadWorth trying but I'm not running to come back soon to eat again, considering how they do have a wait.

This place is legendary in my book.My boyfriend and I headed straight to Swan's after dropping our bags off at our Airbnb, and we got there around 2:30. As expected on a Saturday, there was a short line that we reached the front of after about a 30 minute wait.It was well worth it. As soon as two patrons got up from the counter, one of the guys motioned for us to come sit. I had a Coke in my hand that I bought from Walgreen's across the street (because they only offered Pepsi which I'm firmly against), and he immediately asked if I wanted a cup of ice and offered my boyfriend a beer... From that moment forward, the service just continued to blow me away!We started by sampling the day's oysters - 3 types of Miyagi (BC, Washington, and a local one) - as well as little necks and Cherrystone's. I ate them all with a little extra salt, lemon juice, and their homemade Thai chili hot sauce. The hot sauce was surprisingly spicy, but I wasn't too fond of their mignette.Next, we had the crab back and half-cracked crab. I wish the crab back was served warm because I didn't really like it cold... I also wish we had opted to get some warm butter for the half-cracked crab, but the flavor was great nonetheless.We finished off with a small order of the Sicilian sashimi. I was skeptical of the capers at first, but it was pleasantly interesting, and the fish was fresh. We had hamachi, maguro, sake, scallop, and local halibut. Every minute we were at the counter, we felt special and very welcome by two guys especially, who seemed to genuinely want us to enjoy ourselves.If you like good seafood and good people, you have to come here. It's a must!

Knowing the hype surrounding this place, my group of six arrived on an early Saturday morning at 10am to a long line of customers, and after just over an hour, we were seated at the end of the bar! Even though the seating arrangement is very cramped, the food and the service here were unbelievable, and the experience was totally worth the wait!Let's start with the service--all of the servers here were so genuinely kind and helpful when we made our selections. They were extremely attentive and made sure we always had everything we needed--starting, of course, with plenty of bread and butter. And then there's the food. Our group started with a dozen oysters (coming from Washington, British Columbia, and California)--on the side were the typical lemon and horseradish, but also a delicious spicy Thai chili sauce that was so hot and unique. These were literally the best oysters I've had in my life--they were so fresh and complex in flavor (not just salty brine).And then came my favorite dish of all: the smoked salmon, which was served over slices of bread and topped with capers and onions. The smoked salmon was savory, smokey, and, by far, the creamiest smoked salmon I've had in my life--this dish was literally to die for! We also had the combination Louie salad, which included plenty of cooked seafood like crab and shrimp over a bed of simple lettuce and a creamy dressing. While the seafood was good, I didn't find this dish wasn't all that flavorful or special. We also had the calamari salad, which was a small dish of cooked calamari along with simple onions and garnish, but this also wasn't all that memorable.We ended with an order of the large Sicilian sashimi platter, which came with raw slices of salmon, scallops, ahi tuna, yellowtail, among some other fish I can't remember--everything was dressed in plenty of olive oil and topped with capers and onions. This dish had plenty of great flavorful (and again, the seafood was so fresh!), and the remaining olive oil on the plate was perfect for dipping with the bread!

This place has been on my radar since I've seen it on Anthony Bordain's... one of his shows! I think it was the Bay Area episode of Layover. Anyway, I finally got to visit this spot yesterday. Perfect timing, too, because it was midday on a Tuesday, with a short line. This is a tiny spot, very old school, only the counter space for guests. It is a raw bar. If you want hot food, this is not the place for you, save the clam chowder. Our party got an assortment of dishes and shared everything, so here goes: - We started with the crab salad. Nothing fancy. Sliced up iceberg lettuce under heaps of dungenous crab legs. All the fixings were on the counter including the dressing, cocktail sauce, lemons, and chili. - the clam chowder is rich, and full of clam flavor. My dad says it's the best he's ever had, but we have different tastes. I saw that the cream sauce was broken, and it wasn't the best clam chowder experience I've ever had. I wish there was more cream, but it was good. - the Italian sashimi plate was interesting. Delicious and fresh, but my personal preference is getting in the way here. There was olive oil, some chopped up red onion, capers, and fresh crushed pepper strewn over the raw fish. The assortment included salmon, hamachi, ahi tuna, atlantic salmon, and then the scallop. The Italian seasoning took away from the fish. The scallop was the best, buttery thing on the plate. LOVED it. In fact, ordered a whole plate of that: - the scallop was melt in your mouth delicious, sweet, buttery. Ugh!!!!! 'nough said. - In addition to the salad, we got a crab cocktail. Clean and delicious. - Finally we got two dozen raw oysters. Delicious flavor. Best in a while. Bill was $206 including the above, a beer and a half, and the crab tamale. Not cheap. The place has been around for 100 years or so, but come on. It is a bit overpriced with no cooking involved. What makes up for this? Ultimately, it is their excellent product, history and the traditional ambiance that is worth the trip. Mmmm!

I ordered a cracked crab for takeout, and it was fantastic. They were very friendly, and the takeout was very quick, unlike the wait times many have experienced.

I'm poor. $50 (cash only) for smoked salmon and half a dozen oysters? PLUS a 1 hour and 15 minute wait? This will be a been there, done that type of ordeal.The food was good, not out of this world. Definitely not worth everything I went through to obtain it. Perhaps I didn't order correctly, but I just can't see what the craze is about.Service was cordial. Not super speedy in my case. The only thing was my oysters had a LOT of shell in them. Woulda cracked a tooth if I weren't such a slow chewer.

If you're looking for pure, simple, fresh, and amazing seafood THIS IS THE PLACE. Everything was freshly prepared in front of your face, so you see everything cracked and sliced on the spot, its mesmerizing. We got there around 12:30/1:00pm on a Thursday and we waited for about 5 minutes before a couple left and we snagged the seats. Bar Seats only so its very limited. - Half Cracked Crabs: Comes out nicely cracked and ready to devour. The pieces pulled way from the shell so easily providing you a piece of fatty crab to enjoy. - Crab Back: Served cold, amazing when dipped with the bread with a sprinkle of pepper. - Dozen mixed Oysters: Chefs choice, didn't have a bad piece. Not too small, not too fatty. - Sicilian Sashimi: Drizzled with olive oil with capers and freshly cracked peppers. The Sashimi melted in your mouth with the perfect sliced to the perfect size .- Uni: Cracked and cleaned in front of our faces. Melt in your mouth buttery amazingness. It is an acquired taste, so if you're a sucker for uni, you HAVE to try some. We got lucky and got the 2nd to the last one they had for the day. So the earlier you go the better chances of you being able to get some. By the time we left around 3ish there was only 1 left. AMAZING AND FRIENDLY STAFF. Even with just a limited amount of seating, we were never rushed. On top of all the food listed above, we both ordered 2 beers and our bill came out to $127, we were both surprised and expected us to do so so so much more damage. We are most definitely making this joint a go to whenever we are in the area.

Shoutout to Anthony Bourdain for introducing this neighborhood gem to us. I have never waited so long to eat at any food establishment, but that is the only downside to Swan. I went on a Saturday morning, about 30 minutes after they opened. Got seated 2.5 hours later. On a rainy Friday afternoon, the wait was still an hour. This is really due to the fact that the restaurant is tiny, with one long bar. On the bright side, Swan makes up for the wait with the food and the service. Once you get inside and get seated, one of the many servers takes your order and you can watch your food being prepared on the other side of the bar. They've got the best clam chowder I've ever had. We alternate between dipping loaves of bread in the chowder and the crab back (it's only $6!!). The combination Louie salad is also amazing. It's really more like more like mounds of crab and shrimp with some lettuce and dressing. The combination seafood cocktail is pretty much the same variety of seafood with some sauce and an added raw oyster. The sashimi plate with capers and onions is also quite tasty. Prices are pretty reasonable considering the quality you get. The environment is also very welcoming. I believe the restaurant is family run, and everyone provides equally amazing service. The first time I went, one of the employees saw me watching him slice smoked salmon and cut me off a chunk to try. It is cash only, but for anyone that uses Chase, there's a branch right across the street. Definitely worth trying (the wait is actually worth it!)

I have been coming to Swan Oyster Depot going on twenty five years now. This simple seafood counter diner has consistently churned out quality food with a happy loving attitude, an attitude you can taste. Really!There is not a whole lot of moving parts here:*Get in line, there's always a line - period*Wait for your turn for a seat at the cramped counter on rickety stools*Choose your food from the not very diverse menu*Then wait for the joy to happen - and it will - guaranteedSwans is about seafood!Possibly the freshest seafood you will find anywhere. There is not a frozen ounce of protein in the house. Every morsel of food tastes like the ocean and that's a very good thing. Shrimp, crab, lobster cocktails and salads, salmon, uni (when available) and a few other varieties of fish are here for your taking.Their clam chowder rivals any cup you'll find in Boston.This family run biz has been doing lunches (only) for over 100 years, so they really got their act together. You'll never feel rushed and you can banter back and forth with these seafood savants who serve you. This is fun, informative and engaging.Whenever I come back home to S.F., I make sure there is always room in my schedule for that hour wait in line at Swans.

Love this place! Opens at 10:30am, and we arrived a little before 9:45am on a Monday morning. We were the 3rd people in line. But within 10 minutes, a crowd had arrived! So please, either make sure you go early or just know that there will absolutely be a wait. Ordered the combo seafood salad with the Louie dressing on the side. A lot of people just order the crab salad. In retrospect, would have preferred just the crab though. Sicilian sashimi is a must. The crab back looks totally gross, but is actually delicious. The only thing I didn't really care for was the smoked trout. I originally came here looking for uni on the half shell, but unfortunately they didn't have any that day. Swan Oyster is a no fuss joint, they're ready to take your orders right when you sit down. You can tell right away that all the guys who work there are very close and treat each other like family. They know they have a lot of people waiting, so service is fast. Please be considerate of others and don't dilly dally after you've eaten. Get in, get out, and enjoy the day after a great meal here.

YUM! This place is absolutely worth the wait. Everything tastes so fresh and juicy and amazing. I came at an odd hour and there was still a huge line out the door! I think it was about a 1.5 hour wait. I've never had clams as big as the ones here... everything had me drooling. I would eat these oysters all day long if I could.

Old school at its finest! Man I have to say I love this place. It definitely gives me that old east coast feel. Swan's is a very famous oyster spot located on Polk. Ok just so you know this place has long lines an hour before opening. They also are cash only but there is a chase bank across the street. Ok so this is how it works. They don't seat you have to find a spot that's open for you and your party. But don't be that person trying to cut the line they will let you know. Once in you take a seat at the bar. If you sit and it's food at the base no worries they are quick with the clean up. The place is super small so you will get to know your neighbor real well. Ok now it's time to order and you most try the oysters. They come out so freaking fresh make sure you get a variety. Next up is the crab damn it's like they just ran out to the water and snatched them up. Everything I had was amazing definitely will be back. Plus the staff here is awesome they treat you real well. Oh yeah if you don't want to dine in you can always do a take out. They do take those orders right at the door and it's fast. So if you're looking for oysters and crab definitely check this place out.

What a waste of a day. First, we waited for almost two hours because I was dying to try the crab back, and by the time we sat down they were out. No cooked crab or crab back. So I can't attest to what those would have tasted like, but I can tell you we ordered like 5 other things and none of them were anything above average. We could have had better seafood at fishermans wharf. I also feel like if you run out of such a popular item and you have a two hour line outside, the decent thing to do is put up a sign or make an announcement that you're out. At any rate, this place is mediocre at best. I definitely won't go back and wouldn't recommend it. My guess is Anthony Bourdain loves it because it's familiar and cozy and he doesn't have to wait for it.

Anthony Anthony Anthony Bourdain!! You have not done me wrong so far. Loved this placed!! I work close by and decided to give it a try. Long wait but so worth it. I decided to get just a crab cocktail and this is no ordinary crab cocktail. Just chunks and chunks of it, I have my list of things I am going to try next time I stop in. I will be back and will sit down next time. I had to take to go. Give it a try people.

Updated review
Not often you get to try a 100 year old establishment, especially one that was featured by Anthony Bourdain...I had the combination salad, cherry clams, mix oysters, clam chowder, and off the menu sashimi platter...Honestly this place is overhyped... the food is good, but not amazing...the combination salad had big and small shrimp with no crab but substitute smoked salmon since they didn't have crabs that day with a thousand island dressing... the mix oysters are your basic fresh oysters... the clam chowder was more on the soupy side, with lots of clams juice...the sashimi was probably my least favorite... it looks amazing on picture, but is overdressed with olive oil... the sashimi grade fish is nowhere near your sushi restaurant quality...Mehhh something to try once, but not worth a second try

I see where a number of people have cited Anthony Bourdain's fondness for this place. I am a native SFranciscan and have eaten here a number of times and it is excellent. But I will say I would never eat somewhere solely on Bourdain's recommendation. I think he is a foodie fraudIn love with himself

Swan Oyster Depot is a San Francisco institution. It's on the 25 Classic Restaurants to eat in S, 7x7's SF Best Old School Restaurant list, a SF Landmark, It's over 104 years old and even Anthony Bourdain couldn't pass it up. If you have not been, bookmark and make sure you show up with a little patience, an appetite and cash. No credit cards accepted. There's a line every day trailing outside to sit at a counter that boasts a total of about 12 seats. If you ever wonder why, you should take a peek at the fresh seafood they offer - sitting in the window. Clam Chowder, Fresh Oysters, Dungeness Crab, Crab and Shrimp Cocktail and much more. There is speculation online about what time of the day is best to stop by, which I think is funny. I work in the neighborhood, so I see the line start around 10:30 a.m. pushing on to the afternoon. Funny thing is each time that I have been, I have not waited longer than 15 minutes to sit. Guess I'm a lucky girl! Don't wanna wait? Order to go! Call or stop by and just place a Togo order. You know you can picnic that seafood anywhere, it's so good.

I have never eaten inside Swans because I don't ever wait to eat anywhere. But you can cut in front of the line to buy their fresh fish to take out. Don't feel intimidated to do this. The owners are happy to help you right away. Everything is super fresh and ready for your dinner at home..just make sure you look in the window and know exactly what you want. Cutting in line is not acceptable if you are not sure what you want. Order ,pay,get out of the way!

Had a great dinner here. Line is long takes about an hour and a half. We even went during an odd hour. They do allow you to drink in line ... so enjoy. We had bread and butter, Kumamoto oysters, smoked salmon( my favorite), crab back( I heard was good but was not for me), a cup of clam chowder for the hubby( said it was ok) , and scallop (eggs) half dozen(very good). Food was good and fresh but portions were small and hard to get full off of.

Honestly, if you love seafood, then this place is for you. If you don't like seafood, this place can convert you. They only serve the freshest and best quality of seafood selection everyday. It was no different today. I had the following:1) Clam Chowder2) Sicilian Sashimi (Large Portion)3) Crab Back4) 1/2 Dozen ClamsEveryday dish was amazing! Most likely you haven't had seafood served like this before and the service from the people behind the counter just makes this place that much more charming. Total: $46 (before tip)Recommendation: Come early, like wait in line before they open, or you will definitely be waiting for awhile. Read other reviews. I came at 10:15am and was in by 10:45.

I was recommended by my cousin to come and try out the seafood salad. When we got to the store, there was a long line for dining in the restaurant. Instead of dining in, me and my cousin ordered it to go. They gave a very good portion of seafood for the salad and the dressing that came with the salad did not overpower the flavor of the seafood. The combo came with crab meat, big shrimps and little shrimps. Maybe because it was the first meal of he day, that I got full quickly but I think the salad can feed 2 people. I believe the price was $25. It sounds expensive but the amount of seafood given in the salad makes the $25 worth it. I was also told by my cousin that their seafood is fresh so adding up all the details, that $25 is a good price! Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. Maybe next time, I'll try dining in!
