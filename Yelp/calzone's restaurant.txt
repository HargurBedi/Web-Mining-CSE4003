A colleague walked by and felt we should return. She was right. It was so cute. On a hot day there was no AC. But it was good. Service was spotty for our group of three. The short water glasses didn't help. We started with bruschetta and Brussels sprouts and kale salad. They came out promptly and were tasty. The balsamic helped the bruschetta. Mains were lasagna calzone, which was recommended. We also had gnocchi with mushroom sauce. Tasty!!!Even with spotty service, I'll return.

Disappointing from the moment we walked in. We have long admired this place from afar; it has a very slick sign out front. But the interior doesn't match - it's more simple-kitschy, with bright red wooden shelves overstacked with old cans, small rickety tables, uncomfortable seating, and a little too much light.We waited more than five minutes to see any hint of our server and he didn't feel that was significant enough to warrant discussion. We were all interested in pizza and asked if three of us could share one, as they were priced at $19. He replied quite haughtily that all the pizzas were personal pizzas, which turned out to be false. We ordered two and took the equivalent of one back to our hotel. By comparison, if we have a coupon we can get a family-size Papa Murphy's pizza for $12, and that feeds six. Calzone's pizza was ok, but not that much better than a take-and-bake, and we resented the absence of grated cheese. We had to ask for it. We asked about bread then ordered garlic bread in lieu of a complementary loaf. Our server brought both. A Caesar salad was served with very bitter greens that left an acrid aftertaste. We appreciate the restaurant deducting it from our bill, but we won't be back. There are some outstanding restaurants in North Beach. This isn't one of them. It's more of a tourist trap.

My friend ordered a pasta with a garlic scallop sauce which was next to the fettuccine section on the menu and when it came it was a red sauce. When she told our waiter the issue he said that she ordered it and she should have known even though the menu did not specify. He did not offer to fix it nor get her something different and for $22 for a small bowl of pasta I'd hope they would at least try to fix the issue. OTHER THAN THAT... my food was good, my boyfriends food was good. But service wise.. 2/10.

Came here for lunch with a friend on our lunch breaks. I've walked by this place and always see people sitting outside so I figured it would be pretty good- it was actually pretty mediocre. Ambiance: The one thing I loved about this restaurant is the outside seating. It's very cute and fun since there aren't many restaurants near it that have outside seating. Service: The service was pretty good here. Our waitress was quick and helpful. We told her we were in a hurry so she immediately brought the check.Food: The food here just wasn't as good as it could be. This place has potential because of the location and all- maybe just change up the menu. My friend and I both got a salad. I got the arugula salad and my friend got the COB salad. We both thought they were just alright. Definitely big portions at least. My arugula salad was just a little plain and the toppings on it weren't as I expected. The roasted tomatoes were rough and chewy, the lemon dressing was way to bitter and didn't do well with the salad. Overall, for the price- you can for sure find better food in the area. If you just want to get wine and appetizers and sit outside, this may be the place!

Mmmmm... I love Calzone's. I had the Dungess Crab pasta and it has to be among the best pasta dishes I've ever had in my entire life. I'm salivating just at the thought. Seriously, the pasta and sauce were perfection and the crab was ridiculously plentiful. Bread was served without butter or olive oil, but there was a place setting the with olive oil on the table. It was okay, but the highlight was my entree. Outdoor seating, on the sidewalk, is available, but we sat inside. The seating is limited, however we arrived at the perfect time and our party was able to acquire seating in a very short amount of time. We stopped at Calzone's upon recommendation of the world's best Uber driver and I'm so glad that we did. This will be among one of my first stops in San Francisco when we return.

I love the atmosphere of this Italian restaurant in North Beach, and it's open late. We shared the salmon and dungeness crab bruschetta(2 pieces)...and the bacon-wrapped scallops(4 pieces). My friend loved the scallops and ordered a second round. I think I've come here 3 times and have always had a dish with dungeness crab. We also had espresso and decaf coffee at the end. Food is always good here, but a little pricey.

Literally just walked out. Normally I'm a strict Yelper. But my wife and I are only I town for a few hours and we have a newborn in tow, so we ducked in here. Should have listened to the reviews. Ordered a carafe of wine and Brussels sprout pizza. Wine never came. Brussels were literally uncooked. Waitress checked on us once so we couldn't remind her that we were waiting on wine. When we pointed out our wine never came the waitress brought the check and said she had taken the wine off the bill, like she was doing us a favor. On a positive note. Best club soda I ever had.

This is the definition of a tourist trap. We were desperate to eat a late night snack, and Calzone's was the only restaurant open at midnight on a holiday (Golden Boy Pizza around the corner had an intimidating line). Prices are so high, I'm offended. We ordered the Italian potstickers as an appetizer, and C asked the person who brought our water how many came in an order. He confirmed- 5. When the dish arrived, there were only 4. We were confused, but our server explained that we had asked the bus boy, who did not know anything about the dishes. Well then don't pretend you know; just TELL US you don't know! 4 potstickers for $16, so the cost per bite is ~$2. RIDICULOUS. It was pretty much a Chinese potsticker with Italian meat drenched in soy sauce. I'd rather starve than eat here again.

It was lunch time, and we were very famished. After visiting some famous SF landmarks, we were ready to eat a good meal. We consulted Yelp, and found this fine Italian place.We sat down at one of the small tables outside, and perused the menu. To my delight, they had a filet mignon calzone! No contest! This is what I ordered.The good took about ten minutes to arrive, in the meantime we enjoyed our drinks while looking at the busy street. Once our food arrived, we ate well. The filet mignon calzone was very delicious, and it filled me up for a good while. The staff here was very nice and accommodating. They made sure we were taken care of.I would definitely return the next time I visit NorCal.

This has become my husbands and mine go to for dinner while in San Francisco. I love North beach and the vibe you get there and we have gone to many many restaurants in our lives together and separately. But for our 20th Wedding anniversary we felt ourselves being drawn back for a second time to this great place. The food is outstanding and the service the same. It's not expensive dinner for two and 2 cocktails, a diet coke and iced tea the total price $95 for 2 people that's a great price for an unforgettable dinner!!! I had the arugula and artichoke pizza (again)and my husband the salmon and pasta. I also enjoyed 2 French lemonades a quiet but effective cocktail. We sat outside under the heaters and enjoyed our meal. note: at no time do you feel pressured to leave. They let you take your time and truly savor your meal and you get to watch the city walk by. We will be back forever and as long as they keep those cocktails flowing, I can think of no better place to leave my heart!

Once again I have yelp to thank for ordering the perfect item. Another yelper described the Dungeness crab pasta as possibly their favorite pasta dish ever, prompting me to try it. It was a decision I would not regret. The pasta seemed freshly made and I didn't have to fork around trying to find the crab pieces, there were plenty of them. I inhaled the whole thing! We also ordered the bruschetta appetizer which tasted outstanding as well. It was a beautiful day in San Francisco so they had the giant windows completely open, allowing for a nice breeze and people watching.

We went to the city with a group of friends and ended up here for dinner based on a friend's recommendation. We got here pretty early for dinner but the place was already super packed! We were told the wait was over 45 minutes, and that's when I resorted to Open Table - I was actually able to snatch a reservation for a much earlier time but when we returned for it, we still had to wait...what a bummer!When they finally seated us, it took forever for the waiter to get to us - I know it's crazy busy but it felt like there was only one waiter for the whole second floor. We ordered a variety of items to share but, of course, food took awhile to be served also. We basically did not get any service during our meal since it was impossible to flag someone down in the awkward corner where no one sees you - I almost had to stand up and wave my arms around at the end when we were trying to get our check because the waiter never looked our way once even though he was serving our neighboring tables!Overall, food was just mediocre...I honestly don't see the appeal for a place as busy as this one. Since we rarely go to the city, I doubt we will ever return to this place!

Been walking by this place for so long and not stoping to eat here. The place looks really cool because there's chairs and tables on the sidewalk but it comes with a price. To me this place is way too expensive, I don't want to sound cheap or something but you could look at the receipts and look at the pictures and you tell me ? This place is good to try one time in my books. It's always crowded every time I walk by and when I was in there it was really crowded and there's not much moving space. As for the food it was good my filleted calzone was pretty good, it tasted like cheesesteak wrap with Naan bread and baked it was good. The pizza Was really good to it had the same naan bread taste to it I guess that's their secret ingredients they use in their dough. Another your bookmark gone. I give this place 3 and half stars.

Calzone's is a very busy place! Also it has a warm inviting atmosphere. There is outside seating for that very authentic experience. The menu is Italian cuisine. I decided to go with the meatball sandwich and fries. It was tasty and good. The fries complemented the sandwich, the meatball sandwich could have used a bit more sauce. However the delicious meatballs and the generous amount more than made up for it. The staff is friendly also.

This is a nice place to visit as it's one of Columbus' more visible restaurants. The hustle and bustle of the restaurant give it a cool vibe. The patrons seemed to be having a good time. We were seated quick quickly, within 10 minutes after arriving on a Saturday night. The food is probably ok, my calzone lacked flavor but the few other items I've tasted were relatively good.

I was looking forward to lunch here when my friend suggested it, but unfortunately I wasn't too impressed. Located on Columbus Ave in North Beach, Calzone's is one of those places that looks like it has been around forever and really embodies the spirit of the Italian neighborhood. Unfortunately, the food just didn't knock it out of the park for me.Since it was my first time here and the place is named Calzone's, I figured that I should get a calzone. The menu item that the restaurant is named after should definitely be the best, right? I got the roasted melanzana calzone, which contains eggplant, spinach, bell peppers and cheese. When the long and skinny calzone came out, I was excited to dig in. It was fine. Nothing amazing. The crust itself didn't taste that fresh, which I think I think took away from the overall meal. There was also no marinara sauce provided for dipping, which I personally think is a must for calzones.Maybe Calzone's has something better on their menu than calzones, but I'm in no rush to return. I think this spot is a-ok for tourists, but I'll be looking for something a little more off-the-beaten path next time I'm in North Beach.

I chose the mushroom on the waiters request, but there was an abundance of mushrooms and not enough gnocchi. Nonetheless it was great and i will be back for anther flavor of gnocchi.

Run into this interesting place while rambling hungrily through this area. It looks like a good place from the outside that transforms to great, when you step in. Red is a bold color to paint the interiors. They've run with it and gotten away with flying colors. A tall ceiling, one side of open glass windows, and another side of mirrors, is a smart way to: (a) pull off the red, and (b) transform a narrow rectangular-for-the-most-part area into seemingly larger space. The shelves are stacked TIGHT with plastic Italian groceries. Anyway, this review is beginning to sound like I went to a museum. Let's get on with the food. I'll keep it brief. Because, it was NOM NOM NOM!! Delicious and unique. With Italian being as widespread a cuisine as it is, to find new options and sensitive flavor profiles was refreshingly enjoyable. Like everyone else says, definitely get the spinach cappellini. The calzones - nothing new, I know - but among the softest, the tastiest, and fluffiest!Service & pricing is alright - nothing to sing paeans about, nothing to complain about either.

The crab dungeness fettuccine was delicious. The presentation made it look like the portion size was small, but it's actually really filling (and decently flavorful, although it needed the grated Parmesan on top). The service could've been better. You have to flag them down if you need something. However, the food was hearty and the ambiance was charming. The wall displays made you feel like you were in an Italian grandma's pantry, in a good way.

Ok so it's kind of a tourist spot, but I've had dates here, brought out of town family, and now popped in after a long day of work. It's prime people watching. The martinis are top notch and make me feel like a lightweight after just one. To be fair it was on an empty stomach. So in lieu of that I stayed for a chicken Caesar and another martini, and left feeling like a million bucks. If you came in here with a million bucks you'd still leave a millionaire. What I'm saying is that it's reasonably priced.

This was our stop for dinner as part of a quick tour of the North Beach area. We stopped mostly because of the ambiance - the tables outside are lovely and excellent for people watching. On a colder day they'll turn on the much welcomed outdoor heaters!The food is definitely quite Americanized, but still delicious! Two of us shared the Heirloom Tomato salad, which was really tasty. With the avocado and the basil crostini, there are a lot of different consistencies here, which is great. The tomatoes were fresh and lovely!For our main course, we shared the Italian calzone. It is huge, and definitely plenty for two people. You may even get three out of it! Again, the food here is good, but Americanized. If you're looking for something more authentic there are definitely other spots in the area to visit. All in all, this is a good quick stop for some tasty well-priced food.

I came here for the first time in 2008 with a group of friends. I ordered a salad and discovered an 3 inch piece of tree twig in my salad. After letting our waiter know, the waiter and manager both tried to convince me that the twig was actually part of the salad...so uh no, no thanks. No more future visits for me to Calzone's!Fast Forward to Summer 2015, I am back here again for a dinner date. Aside from the complimentary bread, we ordered the Caesar salad, house-made ravioli and the shellfish cappellini.couple notes:*Caesar salad was a pass for me. Bland taste and I dislike the uncut appearance of the baby romaine. *House-made ravioli sauce had great flavor. Sadly the ravioli was not cooked long enough, it could have used another minute to boil. I still enjoyed it though.*Date loved the shellfish cappellini.* Bread was not exciting. Lukewarm and kind of tough to chew on.The service and outdoor seating area is what separates this place from the other Italian joints in North Beach. The food here is adequate for me, but I probably should have tried the calzone or the pizza since those dishes are actually in the restaurant's title. If you want a great people-watching spot with average food, Calzone's will serve your purpose. You want authentic italian food? Move on along down Columbus and keep looking.I am happy to report there was no sign of tree twig in any of my food this last visit lol.

Any restaurant with an outdoor seating option like this will automatically get an extra star!Delicious calzones, though the ham in the Italian calzone tasted like deli meat. Lasagna was good, but pretty average. Service was rather slow, and they gave us a block of store-bought butter with the wrapper still intact when asked for butter to go with our bread.. 3 stars for the food, but one extra star for the outdoor option. Go here for dinner and go to Cafe Greco across the street for dessert and coffee.

This place is more of a 3(1/2) kind of place. The seating is the deal breaker... It's very whimsical with the outdoor seating right on the street. You can sit in a row with a max of probably 3 people facing/right on the sidewalk and feel like you are on the streets of Montmartre, Paris.The food was pretty good though. I highly suggest getting any of their fettucine pastas. Can't go wrong. Definitely more on the touristy side but I think the whole experience of it is a winner.

I could sit in this restaurant for hours just admiring their decor....I loved it that much!I ordered an Italian Calzone and my boyfriend ordered a Pizza. We both loved our meals....so fresh and tasty. I also ordered a glass of wine, which was pretty good too. Prices were about on par with the city, the bill coming to about $40 before tip.

If you're looking for a nice SF outdoor ambiance, this is the place. The black and white floor tile and handcraft painted tables adds to the Little Italy vibe experience. The location is in the heart of Northbeach in San Francisco. Great food, good service, and I never stood in line to wait to get seated. I always order their Mojito because it comes with a real sugar cane stick. I dine here on Halloween nights, not because they have a night life party, but because I get to sit down outdoor, eat and watch people pass by in costumes; while I have my wine and crab pizza. Calzone is also one of the restaurants that closes late, @1AM. You cant go wrong with this place, unless you're really just a complainer. enjoy

What the hell kind of tourist bs is this...prices for scraps...seek italian elsewhere people...tourist trap!More details to come after I speak to a manager...hopefully Andre from below...Over a month and no call or follow up from a "manager"...still waiting...Andre A are you there? I would seriously skip this place folks...they survive on pure location alone...

good Italian food, the thing is there's a lot of competition in San Francisco so you could probably find a better around the corner. The reason I'm not giving it a better rating is because it's a restaurant in SF, they should know better that "good food" doesn't cut it

Just hit up this place for the first time and loved it. It's in the heart of North Beach, beautiful inside and outside so there's no bad seat. I had the Italian calzone which was delicious and also gigantic, I could barely eat half of it. The north beach martini was perfect- brandy, sweet vermouth, and a touch of fernet branca. Kinda expensive, but the service was great and I felt like I got what I paid for. I will definitely come back. Thank you!

Service is really bad, lots of harassment, and stuff the server was flirting and when i spilled the wine, he said we were drund and didnt bring us napkings when he was asked to. His name is Jose. At least thats what he said his name is.

Tonight I got to split two meals. The calzones were really good. I've had many calzones, ranging from papa johns, to some Italian guy in New York. There were definitely on the loose half. It's also the best deal. I also got the prawn Alfredo. It being 6 months since I had Alfredo, it was amazing. It was actually really damn good. I also recommend. Atmosphere and all, I've had better, but Check it out!

The chicken calzone was perfection, the girls shared a margerita pizza and said it was the best ever. The calamari was so fresh and melted in my mouth. Service was quick and all of the ingredients tasted so fresh!

Went on a business trip with a couple coworkers and we decided to dine here on a night out. Our waiter, Pablo, gave exceptional service. Our drinks and food were served in very little time, and everything tasted amazing/fresh. The ambiance was warm and cozy. Definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice Italian meal and great service.
