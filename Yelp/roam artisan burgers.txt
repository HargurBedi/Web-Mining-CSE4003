The moment you have been waiting for is FINALLY here!! WELCOME EVERYONE to the FIRST ROUND of the incredible SAN FRANCISCO BURGER BRACKET!!! The San Francisco burger bracket is the event of the year; many burgers will participate but only one will win! Join us as a talented group of diverse individuals embark on a journey to find the best burger in SF!***Send a friend request or follow me to keep up to date on all of the burgers in the burger challenge!***This week, we have a faceoff between Roam Artisan Burgers and Popsons. The review of Roam follows. Wowza, now THAT was a burger (we ordered the heritage burger). Beef was cooked great and paired well with all of the additions. Was not heavy on pickles or bacon, they were just the right amount to improve the taste of the burger. The multigrain bun somehow just added to the taste of the burger. The flavors danced in my mouth to create a beautiful symphony that could rival Beethoven himself. An anonymous employee even remarked that "It is hard to imagine that there can be better burgers than this". Have we quickly found an overall winner but have we blown our loads too quickly? Stay tuned to find out!The fries were shiet tho, the zucchini was way better (That's not a sentence I ever thought I would say). Sweet potato fries had great flavor but were soggy, and the regular fries were rather dry. May in fact be a product of delivery consequences.They even had presentation quality on the delivery! They tied a cool little bow on the wrapping of the burgersPlease view my review on Popsons to get the whole picture of round 1. THE WINNER OF ROUND ONE:DRUMROLL.........ROAM ARTISINAL BURGERS WINS with 100% of participants voting for it!Join back next week to witness round 3! (I'm posting rounds 1 and 2 on the same day)

Heck yes!I ordered the Tejano, and was so pleased. Super fresh, meat prepared just the way I requested. Not too spicy (for myself at least.)This is a fun, trendy space with a nostalgic feel. I sat in a seat with natural lighting which would have been nice if the sun wasn't blaring straight in my face. This didn't change the flavor in my burger tho. The cashier was sweet, polite, and attentive. The menu seemed pretty diverse. Wish the burgers would come with a side tho - fries or salad perhaps? I always think it's kind of a rip off when restaurants serve sandwiches or burgers without a side, which is why this place is getting 4 stars. I would come back, but it wouldn't be the first thing I'd recommend to a friend.

One of my favorite burger joints in SF. The Sunny Side burger is ALWAYS my go to. Who doesn't love a freaking egg inside their burger?!The sweet potatoes fries are an obvious decision. And the coffee shake is best split between friends. You won't go wrong here, friends.

I'm unsure when it happened, but this much I know: after I hike, I need a burger. It's a thing now. A real thing. A real, legitimate, gotta have it thing. And so, even after I had quenched my initial post hike appetite with a donut, biscuits and gravy, a breakfast sandwich, orange juice, a pizza, and possibly some snacks, I was still intent on getting my burger. A plan was made, a route was mapped, and I was burgerbound.Roam is a counter-order affair, which I kinda like. Sometimes you want to sit down and be served, but it's nice being able to belly up to the bar for fast casual and make your order, then eat in peace. I bellied, I ordered the French and Fries, and also the Fryfecta, and also a chocolate shake. Don't judge--I'd been burning thousands and only eating hundreds of calories per day for almost a week. I needed to restore the balance.It wasn't as tidy of an ordering process as I thought--but that's not bad. You just have decisions to make. What kind of bun, what kind of meat, how pink your meat will be; this is a custom joint. I ordered (sesame seed bun, beef, and of course, pink) and we were on our way to sit down.The food came out pretty quickly, and I set off to work. The burger was adorned with a few truffle-parmesan fries which gave it some depth, but the real money was from the piquant sauce. I still don't know what that is entirely for them, but the basic idea behind a piquant sauce is that it's a sharp or strong flavor. This is a French burger, so why not hearken to the French cuisine and make a sauce piquant. Look it up. Piquant--having a pleasantly sharp taste or appetizing flavor. It was bright, but not overwhelming, and even though I do love fries, avocado, caramelized onions, mustard, and greens, that sauce won the day.The Fryfecta--a platter of normal fries, sweet potato ones, and shoestring fried zucchini strands, was a good call. The shreds are just hard to eat without a fork, so don't think of them as fries. They're more a side dish for forking. But still, we dipped in ketchup and I dipped my fries into my shake, and they were salty salvation.The real money, though, was on that chocolate shake. It's the real deal. So creamy, and the ice cream they use has a nice base. The chocolate was smooth, neither too astringent or too blonde, but a rich and easy to swallow brown and beautiful creation.Overall, my post-hike belly was tamed. Mission accomplished. At $50 for two of us, it was a little more than I usually pay, but this is not exactly a side-of-the-road ma and pop in a small town shack. I went all out, but maybe would reel it in a little bit next time to keep it more affordable. Compared to a sit-down spot, though, we came out ahead. Really solid experience with some fun twists on the menu. It was the right call!

Fabulous burgers here!After a nice long walk on the marina we took the 5 minute drive to Roam and boy was it worth it. A walk up and order place, then you sit. Very rustic chairs and tables with small bar too. A few beers on tap. I ordered and loved me classic style turkey burger with avocado. I also had an order of sweet potato fries which were excellent. Also a good selection of sodas(river city root beer) and artisan soda too.(mom had the ginger lime) and loved it too. Parents both ordered grass fed burgers with herb mayo that they enjoyed. I highly recommend this place.

Expect to wait a long time for your order but it is worth the wait. The burgers are delicious as well as the farmers market salad. I also had a coconut lime soda that was divine :-) my daughter love the salted caramel shake, I have to admit I took a couple sips and it truly was delicious. Enjoy!

Two stars because the food is decent, but the service is always extremely slow! I ordered 1 item and a drink and it took 20 MINUTES! There was a girl there with dark hair that was really rude when I asked. I told her it has been over 20 minutes since I order and she responded, "Ok....." and walked away. Not coming back here again.

I love Roam. Roam is life.Their burgers are great and all, but what I want to rave about is their salad. It's a beast--with tons of fresh seasonal veggies, avocado lime dressing, and a mini burger trio (costs extra). Never fails to leave me full and happy. The "mini" salad is also a good sized portion!Their veggie burger is surprisingly good, and it's made with beets so the patty is a bit on the pink side. Super flavorful.The Fry-fecta (sweet potatoes, regular fries, and zucchini fries) is also irresistible. I would recommend sharing...but won't judge if you don't.The atmosphere is casual and lively and attracts a lot of families in the neighborhood.I haven't gotten around to trying their variations (I usually just stick to the classic veggie burger) but they all sound delicious.

Great burger spot! There burgers and ingredients are super fresh and innovative. We started with the Fry-Fecta which was amazing. It's fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini and onion strings. I had the Heritage burger which was incredible, so delicious! I can't remember what my boyfriend had but I remember it being amazing. We ate everything.The only problem I have with this place is how expensive it is :( $60 for two burgers, fry-fecta, and two drinks.

Roam is the perfect spot for good burgers. Turkey burgers are my favorite but they can get really dry. Kudos to Roam for perfecting their turkey burgers which are juicy and flavorful. The one I had was a liiittle on the salty side but I'll give them a pass because everything else was on point (also a little sweet ketchup covered it up just fine). The portions are large too so you'll be good to with one burger. For folks with different dietary needs they have a lettuce wrap option and a gluten free bun (many points for that!).I love the space inside in this location. There's bar seating if you want to watch a game while you eat or tables outside and indoors for a group. It's not huge so I can imagine it gets packed during the busy parts of the day. Looking forward to being back here.

I got a regular burger and regular fries, and it was okay. From what other reviewers have said, getting the higher-end meats or sweet potato fries may amp up your experience, but in terms of standard fare, this place wasn't anything to write home about. It tasted like a regular burger and fries that you could get anywhere. The restaurant was clean and service was pretty quick. The place was packed when I showed up on a Sunday afternoon, so finding a table could be a bit troublesome. If I went back, I think I would try a different meat on my burger, but for the price, I'm not sure if it's worth it. I'd rather just have a burger grilled at home, to be honest.

This restaurant should have amazing burgers, but it was quite disappointing. You can chose beef, bison, turkey, or veggie. I had a Heritage burger with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was expecting a big fat, juicy burger. The burger patty ended up being thin and didn't have much flavor. I usually can't eat an entire burger by myself, but this was small enough for me to finish. The strawberry coconut shake was delicious, but the caramelized pineapple soda just tasted like carbonated soda. The brussel sprouts with chili peppers was the best part of of the meal. They were tiny brussels and roasted. Everything was just average. I was hangry and just needed to be fed.

Yum, yum!I split a Heritage burger and the trifecta along with a strawberry shake. All ingredients are taste higher quality than your standard fast food place like In n Out or Super Duper. I've also ordered the Sunnyside (absolutely delicious!) and Chalet (just okay) before.There's lots of seating but this place is popular! I've always managed to snag a seat, but it's a lot harder on Friday/Saturday night.For my three items, the total came out to $26 which is a bit pricey but given how delicious everything is, well worth.

This place is such a gem to Union St. in San Francisco! Iv'e been coming here for years and boy oh boy things haven't changed. Fresh ingredients, free range beef, diestel turkey, and all the sauces in the world. My favorite burger here is the BBQ burger with the beef patty. Such great flavors with each and every bite. They do not chill on the BBQ sauce which how I like it, sauce is not too sweet with a bit of spice which complements the burger and the SWISS cheese. They have great sides that go well as well, I usually get the fries but when I'm with a group the fryecta is the way to go! It's has French fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini + onion strings! Oh so good with garlic aioli! Try this place if you're in the area! You wont regret it!

This place lives up to its reviews. Good burgers, good atmosphere, good service. I ordered a regular burger with cheese well done and the meat was still juicy and flavorful. I also added bacon to it and the bacon was nice and thick. Perhaps my favorite part though was their hot sauce. The burger taste absolutely delicious with it. It's a Chipotle habanero hot sauce and it's so flavorful, a bit spicy but bare able. The russet fries are also delicious and crispy. They have a water station and I enjoyed it. The water was a cool temperature and didn't taste like tap water. Definitely worth trying although it is a bit pricey but I've come to realize everything is here in SF.

Wanted to try a new burger place in SF, so we decided to give this place a shot. It's not a traditional type of restaurant where you're seated and have a waiter. It's more of a you order, find a seat and they will bring the food out to you type of place. Only problem with that is this is SF, the location is small, and there are a ton of people. Good luck finding a seat. However, besides that, the food itself is pretty good. Not the best burger I've ever had, but I didn't leave disappointed. They also have the bison option, so if you don't want to eat Mrs. Cow, then you can eat Mr. Buffalo instead. They also have an option to call the Fry-fecta which allows you to try all three fries. A pretty good idea. If you like burgers, and are in SF give it a shot. It's not the greatest burger place in SF, but it's a worthy contender.

Technically, Roam is considered a chain restaurant, but it unequivocally sets itself apart from conventional chains with its focus on sustainability and use of high-quality ingredients. As a vegetarian, I was especially interested in trying the organic veggie burger, and I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint! And for those who don't prefer meat-free alternatives, Roam also carries grass-fed beef, free-range turkey, all-natural bison, and even elk.In addition to the five types of burgers, there are several toppings and sauces to choose from. A bunch of suggested combinations/styles are available, but you can also build your own. The menu's customizable structure ensures that there's something for everyone, which is awesome for people who have dietary restrictions, or who're otherwise really picky with their food. The veggie burger, as I already mentioned, is fantastic. Its specific ingredients aren't disclosed, but quinoa, rather than soy protein, visibly serves as the main component. As a result, it's softer and more delicate than some other veggie burgers. The patty's striking, reddish appearance is most likely attributed to beets, although you can't taste them.Russet or sweet potato fries are sold separately, and both are crispy, flavorful, and not too greasy. A third option, which I didn't have the chance to try, is the zucchini onion haystack. Or if you're truly indecisive, you can go with the "fry-fecta," a selection of all three sides.Roam's Union Street location is a little out of the way, but it's walkable if you're heading over from Ghirardelli Square (about a mile). The variety and quality of the food is enough to warrant a trip if you need a break from all of that chocolate!

Loved my vegetarian burger with rosemary fries ! The system is, you wait in line to order food, and after you order you look/wait for a table while your food is being prepared in the kitchen. Some tables are a little snug and can feel like you have no privacy, but that's okay because the food is delicious! They also have a counter full of delicious dips and sauces to accompany your burger. They serve only beer.

i absolutely love the burgers and fries here! i ordered the sunny side burger expect i switched out the chili sauce to herb mayo & asked for no tomatoes (i don't like tomatoes). i also ordered the fry-fecta. sunny side burger (5/5): burger + egg = yasss. the egg, the caramelized onions, & the buns were the highlights of my burger.fry-fecta (5/5) - combination of russet fries, sweet potato fries, zucchini onion haystack. this combo was delicious! my boyfriend and i couldn't finish it because we were stuffed from our burger. notes: you order your food at the cash register and then you find an available table to sit down. you get water & utensils yourself. there are tables outside, good for parties with pets. the food here is delicious, but a bit pricey. there's meter parking, but it's possible to find street parking a few blocks away.

Loveeee Roam Burger! One of the best burgers I've tried in the city. It ranges about $10 for a burger but it is very tasteful. You're able to choose type of patty you want (beef, turkey, bison, veggie and elk ($1.99 more). I usually get the the French and Fries burger with Beef which comes with Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard. CAN YOU SAY YUMMMM!!

I had the burger with truffle fries inside and a side of the onion/zucchini dish. Both were amazing. The truffle fry burger had just enough fries to satisfy my curiosity, and the sesame seed bun was stable and non-soggy without being huge and overbearing. The onion/zucchini fries were great dipped in their special sauce, but a bit awkward to dip so next time I'd drizzle.Next time I'm going to try a shake and their farmers market salad. Seems you can't go wrong here from what friends have said.

Ahh roam burger with all of your reviews, I knew I needed to stop by on my trip to SF. All of the burgers sounded really good so I had a hard time choosing. I ended up ordering the sunny side beef burger, because of course, anything with an egg must be good. You also have your choice of veggie, turkey and bison. I also got the fry-fecta which is perfect for indecisive people like me. You order at the cash register, get a number and they bring it out to you. We sat at the bar which was cool, as we watched them make milk shakes, sodas and drinks. Our burger came out and the first bite had me drooling. It was simply just an amazing burger with caramelized onions and their home made hot sauce. I scarfed it down and went in on the fries. All of the fries were good but my favorite was the sweet potatoes. Their zucchini fries tasted like crispy onions. This is the spot to go if you're craving a burger!! Definitely satisfying to say the least.

My go to place for a good burger. Order and find a seat. They will bring the burgers when it's ready. Dim lighting, lots of seats, but when they get busy, it might be hard to get a table. Services always friendly. First you choose your protein and I always pick **BEEF, **Medium Rare. And I normally and always created my own. I had **House Sauce and Mix it with the **House HOT sauce they provide for you at the condiment table. Their Herb Ranch is good as well. I add **Butter Lettuce, **Tomato, **House-Made Pickles and **Onion. FYI all free. With **Pepper Jack. And debating on my mood, I love to add **Avocado, **Egg or **Bacon. And when im hungry, I add all 3 and its amazing, messy but so yummy! You can also add their **Truffle Parmesan Fries inside your burger. I love their Truffle Parmesan Fries as well as their **Sweet Potato Fries. I do not like the trio tray because its so little. Just go with the full order because their regular fries are so good.

I was able to sample this place on a random work night, your boss says find me a good burger in the city, with bars adjacent!! Found this place, already knowing bars are of the plenty in the Marina areaBusy on a tuesday night, Warriors were playing game 4 against the OKC on all the tv's, obviously the whole restaurant was loud, despite the volume of the crowd, we still managed to find seats and grub on some of their burgers and friesI was able to sample their heritage bison burger, with a fried egg and bacon. The burger was good, juicy which is usually not the case with bison but here it was prepped well. the bacon and fried egg of course also helped to take that burger over the top in taste but the bun for me lacked the tools to hold in all the juices being squeezed out, is it messy YES, do I mind nope, for their burger solid 4 stars, the bun for me was the minus mark, after the first two bites bun on top and bottoms started to fall apart.the truffle fries were sampled and were very good as opposed to fries in general when they are piping hot and fresh out the deep fryer they are always going to be good. Other then the place being packed possibly due to the playoffs the place was very spacious hard wood floors, neatly organized tables, clean bathroom, good spot to hit up if you are in the marina wandering aimlessly and get hungryfood **** the heritage bison burger with bacon and fried egg 4 solid stars, up your bun game and make it a 5 star burgerprice $$service ***** despite it being crowded and loud, the staff was very helpful and happyambiance **** modern look, hardwood floors, chairs topped with hardwood to match, clean, definitely burger place I would recommend if in the area of the Marina

Had the Sunny side Burger with Bison and Tejano burger with Beef! Actually preferred the bison over the beef patty. The tortilla chips were a nice touch to the Tejano burger. Overall my favorite of the 2 was the Sunny side burger. Also tried the Fry-Fecta, was ok, the fries were lukewarm and ordinary, the best part of these were the zucchini onion haystack. Next time would just order those. Ordered their seasonal sodas, they were good, just would of preferred more flavor or sweetness would made them awesome. If I am in the area would definitely return.

Dined here the other night with a friend and it was sooo tasty! I ordered the Elk burger, Pacific Blue style with extra watercress. Burger was cooked well and not too red but still very juicy. Perfect amount of toppings and the bun is hefty to hold everything together and not get sloppy. I was skeptical on the fry trifecta because I didn't think I wanted to waste room on the zucchini spiralized fries but they ended up being my favorite... they had some type of seasoning on them that made them stand out. However, next time if I'm dining with just one other person the trifecta is too much and would just go with a single order of fries. Nice small bar area with a TV that we sat at and enjoyed our burgers and beers. I'll be back!

This place is such a gem in my neighborhood! Love the burgers here! This is not a typical sit down restaurant, it is more of a first come first serve place. You order in the front and find a seat then they bring the food to your table. Not a super long wait for your food to come.This place gets pack on the weekends, might be harder to get seats. But turns around pretty fast.They offer a lot of different types of burgers such as the Beef, Turkey, Bison, veggie and even ELK. They have different styles of burgers or you can create your own. *MUST GET: The Chalet Burger: swiss cheese, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato and house sauce. I ordered the burger medium and came out perfect, not dry and full of flavor. Also try the truffle and sweet potato fries! Staff here are super friendly and willing to explain the menu.

Sorry, but I've given this place three chances and the burgers are plain sad. It's unfortunate, because they are obviously trying in some respects (organic ingredients, grass-fed beef, etc.) but then it's as if the chef is clueless because the "house sauce" that comes by default on the classic burger is literally disgusting; the fries are always hard and bland, and the veggie burger is literally a crumbling tasteless mess of crushes peanuts and horseradish (and believe you me, I love a good veggie burger). I gave them an extra star for *trying* with their ingredients, but without a quality chef who knows how to assemble everything in a tasteful manner, that's close to worthless. Super Duper Burger, Veganburg SF, and In-n-Out are where it's at.

People love this place. It's decent..I judge a good burger by the power of the patty. The burger patty did not stand out. Super Duper has a good burger patty. Roam was just okay. I got the Sunny Side with an egg, arugula, and cheese. I like their menu and how it has different options. I'd come back again. It isn't an overpriced burger. They forgot to bring me my meyer lemon soda and it caused some confusion for me to ask them to bring me one. They asked me to pay, but I already did. Whatevs. I'll be back sometime.

Yummmm! Juiciest burgers I've had in a long time. We stopped by after a late night class and tried it out! So glad we did, I'll definitely be back! You can taste the quality and freshness of the beef in their burgers. They're a bit pricy, but hey, it's SF and super fresh.

Been here about a dozen times (mostly due to convenience and proximity) and for some reason think it will get better. If you like dining with a condescending staff and enjoy burgers sized for ants - this is a home run spot for you. Almost every time I walk in the staff behind the counter act as though the presence of a customer is annoying and bothersome - I've had someone different almost every time too. The burgers are TINY. I always forget how small they are before I come back in the mood for a burger. The most frustrating thing about Roam (and the reason it gets 3 stars) is that the flavors are actually great. They serve good beef with good topping combinations. The bacon is nearly as thick as the burger patty and that's a huge no-no for any burger connoisseur like myself. They do also serve very hearty salads - I'm a fan of their farm salad, it's quite filling and healthy.

Really tasty burgers and a wide selection of dressings/accoutrements for your burger. They have some amazing fries here too... traditional, sweet potato, and an onion/zucchini haystack. If you can't decide you can get the trio and have them all which - which is what we did.They also have beers on tap (hubby's fave - Racer 5) and a selection of milkshakes. I got the Blue Bottle coffee milkshake because hey... burger, shake and fries - you never know what the future brings, live it up! The restaurant is rustic chic and comfortable with a big window in front. There's sidewalk seating as well. I think pricing wise it was a little higher than another of our local SF favorites, but not bad. It's Niman Ranch beef which is high quality. Overall a great place to grab some lunch if you're on your way over the GG Bridge to Sausalito (which is what we were doing). I'm sure we'll be back!

I wasn't expecting that much from the photos on the Yelp page, but I was so wrong! This is a pretty casual restaurant with high class burgers. You order at the counter and they'll bring the food to you. I went with the sunny side burger - complete with caramelized onions and an egg. The food came out quickly. The burger size itself is pretty average, since I wasn't super stuffed afterward. So I would definitely recommend trying their fries on the side (bummer we didn't try any, I would've tried the chipotle maple). But the flavors of the burger were all there! The egg made everything juicy, but even without it I could tell the patty and the buns were not just average. The prices are pretty average especially for in the city - about $10-11 per burger. I wish they had some combination options. I would definitely come back if I had the chance, especially since I saw they have shakes too (pumpkin pie)!!

Ordered two cheese burgers and two fries. Once we got our food the guy repeated the right order. When we got to our hotel room we saw it was one cheese burger. (We usually check to make sure it's all in there but since someone repeated the order we didn't) when we to tell them about the mix up they said that we only ordered one cheese burger and two fries, and there was nothing they could do. Of course we didn't get a receipt either because we're idiots I guess. cheese burger and fries were kinda gross. The ranch tasted rotten. Overall the food was not worth it at all.

Great burger spot in/near the Marina! Came here for lunch on the weekend, and will definitely come back to try their other burgers. We were fortunate to find street parking only a block or two away. There wasn't any line when we arrived, and our group was able to find a table pretty quick. We may have just gotten lucky because it always seemed like there was people standing in line while we were eating, and practically every table was occupied. There is also limited outdoor seating if you prefer. The service was quick and friendly. The menu is on the wall when you walk in, has a good amount of options, and is somewhat reasonably priced.We got our food fairly quick after ordering. I had the Sunny Side, which was definitely one of the better burgers I have had. The patty was thick and had a nice amount of pink inside. We also had the Fry-Fecta with the Chipotle Maple seasoning on the sweet potato fries (one of the recommendations by the hostess when we were ordering). Although a little salty, the Fry Fecta is a great side, goes well with the burgers, and is great for a small group. Overall, this is a great burger spot with quality selections on the menu, ample seating, and friendly service. Definitely give this place a try when you're in the area!

Average overall. The meat is just subpar, and this is a burger place after all, so on its meat it will be judged! It's not very flavorful, on the dry side, and thin to the point that I don't think you could get it cooked to order. Everything else is average or slightly better than average, so three stars it is I guess. Onion fries are good and they also have regular and sweet potato fries.

Originally at the Fillmore location, we found out that they were having computer system issues and backed up to the point that the last order was taken an hour ago. The time spent in the SF-loves-waiting-in-lines-Tumblr-worthy line and my table-snagging success were thus in vain, and we decided to try this location instead. Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.Compared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. (+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. (++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright. Maybe it's Instagram syndrome because the presentation in the metal tin is simply beautiful. The regular fries and sweet potato fries were good but not completely out of the ordinary, and the boys didn't like the zucchini onion haystack so I had it all to myself :x To be honest it tastes mostly like fried batter since the zucchini and onion are very thin, but the texture (along with the taste of fried batter, of course) is quite addicting. I garnished my deconstructed sunny side with strings of the haystack and it looked very fancy, reminiscent of artsy Umami burgers and the like.Overall, Roam has one of the better burgers I've tried, with a reasonable but above-average $10 price tag--the satisfying dinner was worth the hilly 1-mile Roam from the Fillmore location.

Dropped in for a burger and fries this afternoon. I was greeted by friendly staff and they promptly took my order. They also checked up on me after my food was served.As for the food, I got a classic burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Nothing mind blowing but I did manage to finish every last bite. The portion size is about right but it's definitely a bit pricey. Great little spot.

This is one of the few burger places that really made me go "Wow" after the first bite. The meat was very tender and didn't feel overly heavy or greasy. The French fries were crispy but not greasy either -- probably the best fries I've had at a sit-down burger place. The shake was 100 as well; it had a good consistency and didn't feel processed or unnatural or anything. And what surprised me the most was how good the sweet potato fries were. I usually don't get sweet potato fries because I don't like them, but my girlfriend ordered them so I tried them out. And they were the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. If I went here again, I actually might consider getting the sweet potato fries with my burger -- something I've never considered before.

The food here is very good- I like the healthy options. Ordering online is great and the staff is friendly. The ONLY problem is that the kitchen can be SLOW. They need to shave 5 minutes off of the time it takes to cook and get the food out. Waiting more than 15 minutes for a burger on an off-peak day is too long.

This place is AWESOME! There's a pretty great variety of burgers to choose from, and you also get 4 options as a patty: Beef, Turkey, Bison (which not many places offer) and the veggie option as well for anyone wanting a meat alternative.The food itself was so tasty and very comparable to places like Super Duper and Unami Burger, which are great places in their own right. I feel like it's fair to say that Roam is more on the pricey side (usually about 15-20 per person depending on what you get), but it's also on Union Street, so that's expected. You get what you pay for, and you're paying for yummy goodness.Overall, flavorful food with good proportions, attentive service and a nice location that's cozy yet fun makes this a place I'd highly recommend.

Veggie burger threw me off at first because it was red (i hate beets) but it was delicious!!! The fries were great too. I just wish they had jalapenos. The jalapeno relish was not good at all. The vanilla milkshake was great too! It's hard to get a triple threat...I will definitely be back!

Classic Beef Burger Quality of beef had a good mouthfeel but needed more seasoning Portion was filling and did the job Fry-fecta was a great way to sample their fried offerings (truffle fries, sweet potato fries and zucchini fries) favorite of the 3 was the truffle fries House pickles were great and really liked the variety of meat (turkey, bison), sauce (bbq, ranch, etc) and side add on options (egg, cheese) for the burgers Overall ThoughtsEvidently, the turkey burger was spot on and will be something I plan to come back and try

Glad to finally check off a "Top 10" burger from my list! I came here specifically for the burger, and I was not disappointed. While I would not list this burger in my top 10, it was still a good burger. First of all, great location. The area is really unique, clean, and there's plenty of shops to visit in the neighborhood. The restaurant itself is very trendy and "fun," clean and orderly. The waitstaff was very friendly, the cashier taking my order was helpful with suggestions and didn't mind waiting a few minutes for us to figure out what we wanted to order.I ordered the Classic burger, with cheddar cheese, and an order of fries. I would give the burger a 3.5 out of 5, the fries a 4.5 out of 5. The burger was a little dry, I needed to ask for more sauce. The fries were VERY good, one order is big enough for two people. Everyone I was with enjoyed their burgers, but all agreed the fries were the best part of the visit.

The wait time was really short for a crowded day like today for the Warriors vs Spurs. As the night progressed it was getting more crowded especially for the bar. The food had great flavors, amazing smoked bacon, and juicy beef patties. Although they were pretty big burgers it was a good filing were we didn't feel uncomfortable.The atmosphere is predominantly white and got a little frat boy ratty. The workers were nice and provided great service.As for the sports tv, it was pretty small and not accessible for everyone.Because of the atmosphere we give it an Overall 4/5 we recommend going on a non sports day.

Fabulous gluten free burger and incredible sweet potato fries! I'm going to be dreaming about those babies for awhile... it's really hard to find a good gf bun, but they pulled it off. Juicy meat, loaded with fresh condiments, and a good amount of fries in each order. Cons, it's pricy. Fries have to be purchased separately. Also it gets really crowded and loud really fast. I had to change my babe in the restroom without a changing table (please, hold the applause), and when I came out the line had tripled. If you can find parking (or use the $3/15 minutes parking garage down the street), I would say GO FOR IT!

Overall this is a pretty good place to go for a burger. Lots of options available for everyone; meat lovers, veggie lovers, gluten free etc. I tried their sunny side burger with a gluten free bun. It was cooked medium rare like I asked which I definitely appreciate. But I wasn't blown away and it was good but not like "wow I have to go back again for it." Their trio of fries is great for sharing. For four people out bill came out to around $55. Three stars because I just don't feel like it hit the 4 star mark, but we received good service, clean environment and good idea for groups with lots of different preferences.

I honestly was expecting more from this place after seeing it on Instagram.I got a custom burger. It had the veggies, turkey burger, and a fried egg. The turkey party itself was just a tad on the dry side. But what was most off putting for me was the fried egg. I was expecting it to have a runny yolk, but the whole egg was completely fried so the yolk got flat and I could taste all the oil on it too. The presentation was just alright for my burger as well. My boyfriends burger looked nice, but mine was just a little sloppy. There was also a lot of the veggies that slipped out of the bun to the bottom of the wrapper on the burger.The people were nice though. We were waiting for a table outside since it was so crowded, and they moved some tables for us. Not sure if I would come here again anytime soon since there are some other burger places I want to try.

The most delicious burger I have ever tasted, with a side of perfect fries. Ordered the Sunny Side burger with beef, the Heritage burger with elk, and the Fry Fecta (steel bowl of russet fries, sweet potato fries and zucchini onion string fries). Asked the waiter for extra sauce for the fries and he brought back samples of house sauce and herb mayo, which was above and beyond what we needed for our fries. The Sunny Side burger with beef had hands-down the best cooked beef patty I have ever tasted. Juicy, flavorful, and a perfect portion size. Eat it quickly because the bottom bun soaks up all of those delicious juices and gets soggy. The Heritage burger with elk had the perfect toppings- bacon, mouthwatering caramelized onions and herb mayo. This was my first time trying elk. It's rather lean, not very juicy, and gamey. I will get this burger with beef next time and yes, there will be a next time. Get the Fry-Fecta. All three varieties were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. Portion is substantial, so bring a hungry friend or two. Other things: Order first, grab a seat, prop up your number, get your own water and condiments, and a waiter will bring you your piece of sustainable, clean comfort food heaven. The decor is inviting and warm. It's a bit crowded, but still a good place for a date or hanging out with a friend or two. Can't say this enough- best beef burger ever.

Very delicious burgers - you can choose between organic beef, grass fed bison, Diestel chicken and vegetarian patties - and interesting toppings. The size of the burgers is not that big compared to Barney's, but definitely enough. Being 3 adults and 2 kids we tried different burgers and we were all very happy with our choice. Eating there isn't cheap though - but I will definitely be back.
