The food was wonderful. But the service was terrible. To start off we ordered 1/2 shell oysters which were fresh. On the side we also got the sourdough clam chowder soup. The bread had a great texture and tinge of sour flavor towards the end. For the entrees we got the grilled seafood platter with fresh Cord fish, Salmon, Shrimp with Cajun seasoning. The fish came out nice and soft with perfect grilled marks on it with charred flavor. The second dish was the Cioppino. This dish has mussels, shrimp, salmon and a few crab legs served over pasta and tomato based sauce. The meat was soaked in the sauce and was tender with fresh flavors. The server didn't care after taking the order and bringing out the food. We asked for couple of plates so that we can share the food, which never showed up. There was no sea food cracker served. (We observed it being served on other tables). We pretty much had to use the forks and knives. We asked for some extra paper napkins during the start of our meals which showed up while we were finished. The food is great I will recommend the place just hope for being served by a good server.

This is my go-to restaurant when I'm playing tourist in SF. One of the main draws is the location, which is right in the middle of Pier 39, making it very convenient to come here.My favorite appetizer, which I order every time without fail, is the sweet and sour calamari. It's perfectly breaded and tossed in a delicious sauce with onions and green peppers. The flavor is irresistible and I've never had a dish quite like it. For the main entree, I usually order the Pier Market Mixed Grill, which features a trio of salmon, swordfish and a shrimp skewer. I also love their grilled salmon on bannock bread (a fried Native American style bread). The bread has a crave-able buttery exterior and is super soft on the inside.The customer service is pretty good here and we usually get seated immediately during lunchtime on Saturdays as long as we come before noon.

This place is in such a prime location. It sits in the middle of the popular pier 39 along the boardwalk and water. My party got seated right away and we had a beautiful view of the ocean . This place has the peaceful Oceanside feel and smell to it. The service was amazing. Our server was super nice and answered all my ingredients questions very enthusiastically. She knew everything on the menu. We ordered the calamari to start things off. This was delicious. It was cooked the perfect amount where it's not too fried but still stayed true to its natural taste. For my main dish, I ordered the chicken breast. This is why I'm giving a 4 stars and not 5. The chicken Breast wasn't very juicy and didn't have much taste to it. It was rather plain. My brother got the jambalaya and that looked amazing. He wouldn't share any with me so next time I'm here, I'm looking forward to ordering it.

This is pure greatness of San Francisco. The real City treat. Welcoming staff as soon as you enter. Superior seating arrangements. Bay windows. Romantic night setting. Inviting day setting. Fresh seafood. Full of fantastic flavors and the scents of the food are unspeakably wonderful. The bar is rustic and modern at the same time. Great menu selections both appetizer, entree, dessert, and drinks. The drinks were unbelievably stiff while full of flavor, blended by a magician maestro at the helm of a busy bar. Outside seating is accompanied by individual heaters, a good amount of shade, great visuals of the wharf or tourists. You can get great music when outside on random weeknights with a portable DJ or Pianist, even Reggae and eclectic Jazz eith live Sax players. Truly inviting tasty food and drinks to warm up your city touring or walking. Prices elegantly fasioned to the venue as close to perfection. Great great great. Casual attire here, due to location. Perfect for the casual couple or friendly meetings. Group seating and VIP service is available along with private rooms for your company upon reservation. That is the hidden gem here for corporate. Pricey parking nearby, this is SF, expect that. Neutral Pier 39 location. Fabulous and PRIDE friendly staff. Enjoy vintage SF when coming here. Drop in this place for an excellent everything.

This place is in the center of pier 39. It is right next to the pier market STAND which I think is different from the restaurant? As you can image many things are over priced for the tourists. We got a clam chowder,calamari, jambalaya, and clam linguini. The chowder was pretty good, the calamari was kind of rubbery and we didn't even finish it. The jambalaya was pretty good, very tomatoy. The clam linguini was very garlicy like a lot of garlic that is very overwhelming.

Really solid restaurant to eat at and it's smacked in the middle of Pier 39. We were seated by window where we can see the sea lions. We got the shrimp cocktail, garlic fries, raw oysters, and a whole crab. The shrimp cocktail was fresh, juicy, and big. The garlic fries was solid. The raw oysters was fresh and delicious. The whole dungeness crab was very garlic-y, juicy fresh crab meat, and lots of meat. Get your hands dirty with that crab. We also received complimentary garlic bread via a coupon we had. Good garlic bread. For dessert we got the bread pudding. Very good. Moist and delicious.Service was very good and friendly. Give this place a shot if you want to stay within Pier 39.

My second time here. Came with a group of four from out of the city last time about a year ago and the food and service were fantastic and wrote up a 5-Star Yelp comment. The manager even sent me a follow up thank you. This time four of us from work came and the food was, again, great. The service was perfect and the price was reasonable for what you ordered. I had the Buffalo Wings and there was plenty.....filled my plate and we shared two plates of Garlic Fries...and they tasted excellent. On a side note, I really like this place's commitment to service and how clean it is and the fun atmosphere. Will be back.

I've been here several times and have by and large enjoyed my experiences. The blue cheese salad with and without the tuna, the mussels, and crab louie are all delicious.The drinks selection is decent, but what I like most about this place is how chill it is, the outside seating, and general relaxed feel.You won't feel rushed even if it's busy, and service is always excellent.I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants a proper sit-down / non fast food experience at the pier.

I'm Alaskan so the seafood would have to pprreetttyy amazing to get a 5 out of 5 review from me. The food was good (the crab cakes were REALLY good ) but I would classify it as "great" or "amazing". The restaurant itself couldn't have been more inviting though, from being greeted by Steve (SO BEYOND FRIENDLY) to the PERFECT patio service by the AMAZING Rosa!Would def recommend visitors give Pier Market a try!

I would give this place 2.5 stars on 5.0. The fish and chips were 'okayish'. Inspite of being one of the largest restaurants at pier 39 I think I have had better fish and chips there. We generally eat at this place called Hook but my dad insisted on trying this place out. Clam chowder was good, don't think you can go wrong with that.The only thing I will go back to this place is for their Raspberry iced tea. Just the right amount of sweetness.

My friends and I decided to go here for dinner because the food looked amazing. The wait was really long though...probably almost 2 hrs. But hey, I went with a group of 7 so maybe they had to wait for room to clear up.Anyway, we eventually got in and ordered. The food came out and tasted delicious. My friends and I got the clam chowder, fish and chips (i forgot the fancy name), and calamari. The clam chowder wasn't clam chWOWder, but the calamari made up for it. It was hot, fresh, and they gave each of us a lot. The only bad things beside the wait time is that it it's cramped and can get too loud.Overall, this is a good place to go to eat, but make sure you sign in first thing you get there. Use your waiting time to shop rather than just wait around.

Needed some lunch on dry land after a very bumpy whale watching cruise.....despite being in the hub of tourist land, I was very happy with my lunch. Window seats are great for people and sea lion watching!I was starving since I had intelligently skipped breakfast before heading out on the boat, so I started with the clam chowder - soooooooo good. Creamy, flavorful and comforting. I spent my college years in New England, and this was some darn good chowdah, my friend. My server was super sweet and asked if I wanted bread as well... ummm yeah! I never pass up bread, especially since this was sourdough - I am not ashamed that I polished off that whole basket. It would have been a sin to waste any of that bread!Feeling a bit better, I also ordered the Pacific Sole. It was delicious as well, but now I was stuffed full of bread and chowder, so I ended up taking most of it back to my friend's bf to enjoy later - which he did... and even asked where I got it since he liked it so much!

If you are going to go here, get the clam chowder in the bread bowl, they advertise it as their special dish for a reason! It is great! The rest of the food wasn't anything spectacular (we ordered the fishermans platter, fried scallops, garlic sourdough, and buffalo wings). The location on the pier is great and they allow dogs at the outdoor seating, which is nice.

During our visit to SF, we were on a mission to eat a little bit of everything. A lot of people mentioned that we should try "crab rolls" not knowing exactly what that was, we stumbled about this restaurant and tried it. I'm not sure if this place is at all good at making these but I know a good bun when I eat one.. The bun was soggy, the crab was tasteless.. It should be pretty simple to make one of these because it seems like a lobster roll instead with crab. Overall just not a great taste of what I was looking for and since it was my first time, it wouldn't have taken much to WOW me.

Came around dinner time and got seated right away. It took awhile to place our order since the table next to us was giving our server a hard time, but that was fine. I ordered the half dozen oysters, clam chowder bread bowl, and lobster tails. The oysters were so fresh!! Best oysters I've ever had in the Bay. 10/10Clam chowder bread bowl was okay. Nothing fancy. It fills you up though. 8/10Lobster tails... yummm. Lobster meat dipped into the melted butter = HEAVEN. & it comes with fries!! 10/10You also get a view of the ocean, which is nice!

Food is terrible. Only redeeming thing was the garlic bread. The fishermans platter was just bleh. Small pieces of fish with a ton of batter. Fries are soggy and the calamari was not flavorful at all.The server also forgot my sisters order. He didn't even remember until he asked how our food was when everyone else got their food. He didn't use a notepad so I'm not surprised, but if you are going to do that I'd think that you could remember orders.

Stop #2 for Bachelorette Weekend~~~~Starving and fresh off the cruise we all knew we wanted clam chowder bread bowls. There are so many places that have this offering so why did we come here? Not sure exactly but I knew I wanted a sit down restaurant and a cold glass of wine. The wait was only 15 minutes so we took the buzzer and flitted around the shops nearby. Jessy was our server and she was super sweet. I ordered the Sourdough Clam Chowder Bread Bowl ($9) and a big glass of chardonnay ($11). I practically devoured the bread bowl, I haven't eaten bread like that in a while (oooo...crusty bread..so yummy...) We each tried a sip of each other drink but I was completely devoted to my chardonnay (though the martini was mighty tempting!) Jessy didn't bat an eye when we asked her to take our photo and even knew how to use the old school fashioned Kodak camera. Jessy took a great picture of us. And thanks for coming to check on us after all Anthony! We did enjoy our quick lunch here. I am very interested in coming back for the fresh oysters and the fancy cocktails they have after seeing one of those big tropical drinks being delivered to a patron. Looks good guys! Would love to come back.

Great place to try out when visiting the pier 39 in SF. It was our first time here and we brought a family member who was visiting out of the country. We were in the mood for some seafood and decided to try this place out.We were seated right by the window and had such a nice view of the ocean as well as the Alcatraz. The food and drinks we ordered were really delicious. The food tasted really fresh and we all enjoyed the food very much. It is a little pricey but being in the area and at a tourist attraction it is given. The service is fast and friendly as well. We defiantly will be back.

3.5/5Pier Market is one of several seafood restaurants located in the famous Fisherman's Wharf. Compared to the other more upscale seafood places, Pier Market is more affordable in terms of pricing.I had the clam chowder and the cioppino. Their clam chowder was voted the best in Fisherman's Wharf, and I did find it quite tasty. It's been a while since I had an authentic clam chowder, so unfortunately I haven't had much to compare. The cioppino, on the other hand, was average at best. I liked the seafood medley, but I found the addition of pasta to be a bit...unauthentic. From what I know, cioppino is supposed to be a seafood stew only with the minestrone-like broth, no pasta.Service was not good. The restaurant's acoustics made it hard to hear the server, and it didn't help that her voice was so low. She also had to return a couple of times to confirm our order, which honestly shouldn't be necessary in popular establishments like this.For the low price you pay this place does its job for the market segment it serves. However it definitely wasn't the best seafood restaurant I tried in the wharf.

I'm not the biggest fan of seafood (hence the sandwich with no seafood), but I have to say this place was delicious! They give you bread with butter and the food came out rather quick.

Pretty far in, but easy to find.

Stumbled upon this place with Maridel while we waited for our friend at Pier 39.We decided to dine at this place only because it was super cold and we wanted shelter tbh ha ha. I ordered a bowl of their clam chowder and a soda. It was pretty tasty and hearty. They serve you bread and butter here but the bread isn't warm :(On the outside they serve shrimp and crab sandwiches as well as chowder to-go if you don't want to dine in. I actually wanted a lobster roll but they don't have it here.

While the service and setting is very elegant, I found the food to be a tiny step up above a fish and chips stand. We ordered a fishermans platter and clam chowder with a salad.

The restaurant is pretty much in the middle of pier 39's area. We were sat outside, but there were plenty of heaters to keep us warm on a Sunday night. We ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl, clam butter pasta dish, and crab cakes.The clam chowder was delicious. Had the clam taste, creamy delicousness. The clam butter pasta dish we ordered was really good as well. Light, buttery, clammy, mussely flavors combined. The crab cakes were on the expensive side, the appetizer only came with 2 pieces. They were good, but I guess I was just wishing for more.

We decided to spend our evening in Fisherman's Wharf, this is the only seafood restaurant on Pier 39 that is not over priced, worth a try! We came in here on a Tuesday night, so the place wasn't crowded, we were able to get seated next to the window.The menu was a typical list of things you would expect in any seafood restaurant. One of the items they were going on about was the clam chowder, naturally, we ordered a cup each. We have also gotten the Seared Ahi Tuna and Mahi-Mahi. Our server was nice, it didn't take long for our food to arrive too. It wasn't until half way through the dinner that I realized there was a mix up between our plates - Ahi Tuna should come with soy sauce and wasabi, not BBQ sauce. It's nothing major, but given how not busy they are, it shouldn't have been a problem.Clam chowder is definitely highly recommended! I like my Ahi Tuna too, portions are just right, and for that price, this is the place I would come back to again when I visit Pier 39.

Normally, I try to avoid spots in touristy areas. But I have definitely been proven wrong before on this (see: Pike Place Chowder at Pike Place Market) in Seattle. So when my friend said this was one of his go-to spots when he came up to San Francisco, I figured I would give it a shot.And you know what, it was pretty good! Had the clam chowder and fish and chips. Clam chowder, although not the best I've ever had, had the right amount of creaminess and actually HAD lots of clam. The battered fish actually a lot of cod and very light amounts of batter, very solid choice. Considering it's SF and it's a high traffic area at Pier 39, I thought the price was pretty good for what I got.Service was pretty good, and our waiter even told us that there is a 20% discount if you have a AAA card (which I JUST so happen to have). Can't complain with that! Just get here early, because this place does have a significant wait around busy times (got in before the wait made it to one hour long).Definitely surprised at how good Pier Market was. Wouldn't be opposed to a return trip!

My wife and I were in town for the weekend and decided to try Pier Market Seafood Restaurant on a friend's recommendation, and we are definitely not sorry for doing so! We did a very late lunch/early dinner. We both got bowls of clam chowder-- very tasty and satisfying! We probably should've gotten bowls because we were only about halfway done with them before they brought out our main courses (and we felt so guilty for not being able to finish clam chowder this good.)My wife got the Shrimp Trio, which included grilled shrimp, fried shrimp and shrimp scampi (sorry, I'm sounding like Bubba!) From what I saw, the shrimp were a pretty good size, and she loved it. She let her guard down long enough for me to take one, and it was delicious!I decided to go big with their Garlic-Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab, and what I received was quite the eye-opener! This crab came as if it just walked in from a garlic shower. There was at least an entire bulb's worth of minced garlic on it. SO good! The meat was tender, and flavorful.Our waiter, Mo (who deserves his own raving review, I must say), also talked us into dessert: a Warm Chocolate Fudge Cake. Don't let the simple name fool you; this "cake" was more like a slightly baked fudge that happened to visually resemble a piece of chocolate cake. Biting into it was pure bliss, almost a little too chocolatey, if not for the vanilla ice cream that came with it! I'm salivating while remembering this.Will be awaiting my next chance to visit this place!

If your on Pier 39 and you want a nice view and some clam chowder this is a nice place. However if you want more of a meal, this place is too expensive for middle of the road quality and flavor of its dishes. The Clam Chowder was Great, however the Fish and Chips were soggy and lacked flavor. It's a tourist area and you get tourist area quality and pricing $$$$ My recommendation is to get the Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and a cold beer and enjoy that, its what they do best.

On my quest to find a clam chowder bread bowl, this is where I landed. I requested a table with a view of the water which was accommodated. I stopped in around 5PM and it was pretty busy. The wait was 20 minutes but I didn't seem to take that long. Our server was very personable, in fact almost every person I interacted with that works here was very kind. They bring a loaf of sourdough bread and butter before the meal. I really tried to hold back because my bowl was made of bread but.. It was useless. The bread is awesome. I tried the local IPA, which was pretty good! The bread bowl and side Cesar were a great combo. The clam chowder was everything I was told it would be and with the service and the view, I would highly recommend a stop in while wondering the pier.

Their seafoods were pricey because it was a tourist spot, but the food was really fresh, had nice flavor and seasoning, and was well made. Portions are too small to share, so expect to order more for more food if you are really hungry. The food was 3.5 stars. I had to give 2 stars for this review, because the waitress was rude and had an attitude, she had missed writing down one of the order and had insist that we did not tell her when we ask her about our second order. I gave her a small tip of less than 10% because I didn't think she deserved it with her attitude. she saw how I tipped, and when she is handing back my card and receipt, she didn't even look at me and she dropped my card on the floor. This is why you don't deserve the tip, lady.

What a great day to walk around Pier 39! What I love about this area is having so many places that can sustain my hunger!!! I took my time and walked around EVERYWHERE here (I think I might have checked out every store and every restaurant and every nook and cranny) and decided to eat at Pier. There was a little wait, but I didn't mind. Being by myself, it shouldn't be difficult to seat me. The place was PACKED. Luckily, I got a table in less than 5 minutes. I didn't want anything too heavy as I planned on doing a lot more walking, so I opted for the salad and the chowder in a bread bowl. The dressing on that salad was impressive (I'm drooling right now just thinking about it.) It was just the right level of salt and tang and creaminess. The chowder bowl was just as good - this place did not skimp on the clam, it was there aplenty! Saul (my server) was very attentive despite the crowd and the minor chaos going on in the place. I didn't feel overlooked one bit. I'm gonna come back for that salad!!!!

The crab was soft, cold, and fresh, everything I wanted it to be. I asked for no cheese and dressing on the side and the waiter was quick to jot that down and bring the order out! Fast service, good view, and fresh food! A must visit!

This place usually has a bit if wait. The seafood here tasted fresh and some seating areas have a nice view. We ordered the jambalaya and the trout. The jambalaya was good but not the best I've ever had. The trout was nicely grilled with some broccoli and red/green peppers. And you can either have potatoes or rice with it. Overall experience was great.

Great food, proportions were a little small though the rice was a little scoop. Rosa was very friendly and patient, especially with a big party. She most definitely made this dinner more enjoyable. Satisfied!

This was an excellent seafood restaurant right on Pier 39. Great view of the bay and the clam chowder is among the best I've tried in SF. The teriyaki calamari is good in small doses so if you order make sure you have some people to share with!

Mo was the best server! We first met him sitting at the bar while he was singing to a co worker! Being characters ourselves we laughed and loved his witty banter! I asked if he had anything open in his section? His reply "of course let me get you two seated." From the excellent food to his amazing personality my boyfriend and I had such a fun lunch here! Thank you so much Mo! We will be back! Go giants!

Great place to eat seafood. Good clam chowder. My favorite is the "Fisherman's Platter."

Great food and beautiful view. Definitely recommend if you want to eat by the water. The crab and shrimp sandwich was refreshing. The meal comes with complimentary sourdough bread which is absolutely delicious. It is slightly pricey but worth it for the view.

Well the food was awesome. Recommend highly. Yet the service was not. I am still giving,4 star because the food was great and it is not the cook's fault. Waiter took our drink order and said he would be back with some bread. A long time passed, then he came to take our food order and remembered the bread. Ran back too get a basket. Then took our order. I ordered the salad and chowder in a bread bowl combo.... Salad came same time as my wifes main course. No chowder.... Waiting.... Waiting.... Finally waited walked by, flagged him down, asked what he could do for us. I asked about chowder.... Oh... Be right back... Came back with the obviously forgotten meal.. We waited and waited.... Had to ask for bill. Waiter never once asked us for refils on drinks or too see how meal was... Etc.. Very very slow ignored service. I would go back because of the food was soooo good but will ask for a different waiter.

Best experience ever! I came into the restaurant awhile back with a party of 8. My family, and our friends from out of town had such a fantastic time mainly do the the incredible level of service and true hospitality shown to us by Nick. I am assuming he was a manager. Aside from the amazing service, the food and atmosphere was wonderful.

Guess if you don't leave a tip, certain servers will just add their own tip onto your card. Shout out to my waiter Taylor for charging an extra $5 to my bill without my consent. Pretty sure that's illegal brotha, trust, I'm getting my Abe Lincoln back. I didn't leave a tip. Why? Cuz I work in the service industry and if I feel like you didn't do jack sh*t to deserve gratuity I'm not gonna leave one. Taylor took my order, brought me my receipt and a box and that's it. Someone else brought my food, I didn't get my water refilled, I just didn't feel like service deserved anything. Was he rude? No but trust, a 10 year old could've provided me the same level of service. Food was cool. Overpriced, but fish and chips were really good. I just don't like my money taken from me without my consent. Thanks Taylor. 5/7/17 is the date I went. Holla at me if you got beef, T.

We stopped by while traveling SF. We had great food and drinks, but the best part of our visit was Mo. He was super nice and an excellent waiter. He was attentive and on top of everything we needed. He made the lunch memorable and I will definitely be back the food was good, and the service was excellent. Thank you Pier Market for an amazing lunch and experience!
