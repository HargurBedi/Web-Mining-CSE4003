Best way to kill your lungs and die, with all that secondhand smoke and urge to smoke. Worst place for quitters who are constantly around friends who do smoke and wanna come here. Sigh.I quit smoking like, what, 40+ times? Oh well, I'm just a social smoker anyway, you know :)I like this place a lot actually.. Really chill environment and cool place when you want to be with your friends (who smoke, that is). There's a bar and a lounge. It's red lighting inside..It's in the Castro, so yeah there's a lot of gays and lesbians who frequent the place.What I love about here is that Bar on Church (what used to be Transfer) is literally right next door!! Awesome.What I don't like is that I always come out smelling like ass (with a cigarette butt in the cheeks) and very impaired vision.Can you imagine that? Small little asian girl who walks out of the lounge looking like some dumbfuck..Ok, you'll see me here again :D

True.I smoked my first and only cigarette at the age of 5.It was in Indonesia. I had wandered right outside my house and noticed a gardener taking a long drag off of a cigarette, which he promptly threw onto the ground still lit.I watched it still burning and smoking on the ground and ever so slowly walked up to it, picked it up, and took one deep breathed long hit off of it.My mom caught me mid puff.As I exhaled, I could feel my lungs struggling to breathe. My eyes were watering, and I threw that nasty cigarette down amidst a series of whopping coughs. From there I proceeded to stomp all over it - spitting on the pavement with each stomp.I knew then that I would never smoke again.My mom didn't even yell at me. She knew I'd never smoke cigarettes again.So yeah - I'm not down with cigarettes. (I even reluctantly puffed on those candy ones as a kid)But I am down with Amber. Even though my eyes water and my throat constricts when I'm around too much smoke - Amber is a great venue. It's low-key, naturally cool, comfortable, and there's always a fun mixed crowd.The bartenders are easy-going, the drinks are strong, and it's dog-friendly. I don't think Amber will ever be a regular hangout due to my distaste of well...choking... but if you are a smoker, or are just looking for a down-to-earth - yet still relatively swank place to meet with friends...Amber glows bright.

I used to love going to Amber--always met the most interesting peeps there and the bartenders were delicious...Then I stopped going....as I recall..each time I went I was racking up unnecessary dry cleaning charges--my clothes and hair wreaking of cigarettes..some of which I smoked..only because I couldn't stand consuming anything second-hand....

I went on a Monday around happy hour time.The appeal of this place is that they allow smoking and dogs. Mixed crowd including one crazy hippie girl who gave me a flower. There were a neat array of original cocktails. Not a great beer selection. The bartender with bettie page bangs was not super nice or helpful. The furniture is like your grandparent's basement: Its old and smells like smoke. If you're a smoker who wants to drink with your dog, I guess this is the perfect place.

I don't say this about many things, so don't take it lightly, but this place makes me want to quit smoking. i mean, any experience that drives me to take a drunk shower at 2am that doesn't involve a naked man is going to mess with my head a bit. i woke up this morning ALONE with the craziest hair i've ever had, naked, with a towel next to me and needless to say i was pretty confused.the bartender, peter, was fantastic, although the drinks are a bit on the pricey side. they had some pretty sweet art on the walls and the ambiance of the place can really only be described as "classy frat." oh, and they played "anything anything" by dramarama.

I wish I could clone Amber and open a second, identical non-smoking version next door. I do LOVE the feel of this bar -- it's like a hip version of your trashy friend from childhood's livingroom, where your mom always felt uncomfortable letting you sleepover at... but with booze! Unfortunately, I've never managed to stay beyond one drink (and yes, one cigarette) before I just have to take off and get some air. It's great for a short and sweet post-work wind down, but I don't recommend Amber during peak party hours (weekend nights) unless you want to wake up the next morning feeling like your lungs were trampled by a herd of baby dinosaurs.

(Update): The bartender put out a cigarette in someone's eye because he spilled a bit of beer on his girlfriend's pleather boot...and the owner did nothing...I saw the whole thing from across the couch.This used to be my favorite bar, but after witnessing such horrible unwarranted macho chauvinism, it goes from a 5 to a 1. Sorry guys, the party's movin' over to Blackbird.

[pic added]i used to come here a lot. basically, this place is for people who are new smokers who still think they can stop. over the years, my admission to my own nasty nicotine addiction has metamorphosed from a bragging-jovial "yeah, man-- i smoke like a fucking chimney! har-har" to a self-loathing violent "AHHHHHHHH! i need to stop! i hate myself! i'm so weak!" so shit, okay- i'm a smoker. but for some reason, i hate secondhand smoke. the smell of secondhand smoke makes me light up my own in order for it not to bother me. weird, huh? in any case, amber is thick with smoke and super chill. last time i went, it was a cash only bar (which sucks if you drink like a fish, too). the place is smallish and is configured to maximize space. which means that you should be prepared to talk to strangers. so get your pop culture index cards ready, if you're uncomfortable mingling. :P

As my lovely boob - I mean FRIEND, dammit, FRIEND - Pilar D said below....The good folks at Amber were a little less than punctual upon opening on a Saturday evening. Look, bitches, when I wanna drink, I don't wanna wait for it. When it comes to drinking, I am a little bit like a teenage boy on prom night. I will tear a bitch apart if I am not given what I need! Do you understand me, Amber? Are we clear?When the bar did open, I delighted in walking through the doors whilst puffing on a delicious cancer stick. Then I got drunk off of gin & tonics.

Hey...I have a question?Why is it that no one ever mentioned this place to me?Honestly...LOOOOVVVEE this place.You got the hipsters chatting with the "pretty girls" who walked in with the rap-stars. They're all sitting on couches and sharing a table together with the emo kids and the mo's. This place rocks.And furthermore...smoke indoors? Yeah...that sounds good to me! The vibe is amazingly sweet and mellow, and you get along with everyone there. And even if you don't want to talk to someone, it's fine. Everyone here knows that it's just a laid-back vibe and everyone is there to hang and relax.Plus, my favorite part of this place is that it reminds me of hanging out with my friends in high school in their garage - just has that comfy, "what-the-fuck-ever" vibe to it, ya know? Definitely check it out. :)

You're probably noticing a common theme: people who don't smoke still like it here.Sure you have to wash the smoke out of your clothes, but you just might have to invest in a smoking jacket because this place is happenin'. I come by here every so often to hang out with friends and enjoy some bourbon or beer and maybe a cigarette or two. Or three. Er, quit judging me.Sofas galore, fake vintage TV. Hip crowd and not too loud. Friendly doggy who shits on the ground.

I'm not a smoker but I still enjoy hanging out at Amber. You just have to accept the fact that whatever you wear here will reek of smoke. The staff isn't exactly friendly, but they are by no means rude, they get you drinks and move on. They allow dogs here so there is normally a big friendly dog posted up by the door pseudo greeting you as you walk in. I personally wouldn't bring my dog here though... way too smoky. Amber is normally packed on the weekends but Monday night has a good crowd too.

What a great hangout! Visited Amber a few years ago with some friends and thought it was kinda cool that I found yet another of the rare bars that you can still smoke inside of. Now that I live even closer, Amber has become one of my favorite places to chill...thanks Emily X.As one reviewers wrote, the atmosphere is like "your parent's basement," filled with some cool kids that might be up to no good. Because of the ample couch seating--accompanied by awesome coffee tables made of vintage loudspeakers--and lack of juke box (house-provided music) the mood remains relaxed, for the most part. If you're lucky and get there early enough to stake out a seat on the comfy front corner couch, you're in luck.Minus a star for how dingy this place really is. The furniture smells like an ashtray, and so will you after sitting on it smoking and drinking for hours. The bathroom walls are covered in a dense pattern of graffiti and other random pen strewn scribbles and notes; didn't that go out of style years ago?Basically a great place to start the night, which I will likely do this very weekend. Well, Amber, I'll see you soon.

Two things:Yessss, it's a SMOKING bar, which is a huge deal for a European who likes to have an alcoholic beverage in the left hand and a cigarette in the right one on a Friday/Saturday night!Nooooo, it's not as smoky as you would expect (OK, we set right next to the door...) We went there on a Friday night, and guess what, if you arrive before 10/11PM, you can actually get a table!!! Quite a surprise! The crowd is cool, the bartenders are nice, and you can always expect to meet funny people, at least in front of the restrooms :)It has one downside though: cash only...

Wanna get lung cancer in one night? Then you are in luck, because Amber is a health condition waiting to happen!I had heard rumors of this place before I even arrived in SF and while I am not a smoker anymore, I figured, how bad can it really be. The answer is pretty bad and this was on a school night, can't even imagine how smokey it would be on a weekend. It might have been a lot harder on me last night because I am in the process of getting over bronchitis, but even still, yikes, I definitely prefer the smoke free bars.However, if you don't mind smoke or are a smoker, then you will adore this place. The people were definitely friendly and the permanent cigarette in mouth owner is just as cute as the rumors report and if you like dogs then you will love it since there are plenty of friendly pooches around to pet and play with. I do feel kinda bad that they are being forced to hang out in all that smoke though. I don't know if I will be coming back solely due to the smoke, but I did like this place and I wouldn't rule it out for future stop ins.

Loungey, nice set-up of seating, art on walls. Not too crowded. Plenty of elbow room. Certainly a nice follow-up to a night of hopping from dive bar to karaoke bar in the San Francisco drizzle. I am not a smoker. Amber leaves me congested and turns my dried nasal mucus [aka "boogers "] black. I probably won't be returning soon, but I know some friends of mine will be back.

This is one of the few places that knows how to make a bitchin Old Fashioned. The bartenders are full of bar smarts and are generally pleasant to deal with. The crowd is a mix of too cold, too hot, and just right if you know what I mean. It's well rounded, that's what I mean. I also love the late 70's, early 80's feel of the decor and love it when I can snag some space on a couch, especially if they're playing the young ones or some crazy rock doc. I hate the smoking though.

I was here with four female friends and one guy friend, once our guy friend left, it was like non-stop leering eyes and bad pick-ups from all the straight dudes, and there were a ton of them from what I could tell.I have to say, aside from the crowd, I like the decor and set-up of the bar.

When I was a smoker, I loved this bar & since I'm all East Coast & shit, I still don't really mind being around indoor smoking (I mean, I understand you can't smoke indoors in NY anymore, but you used to be able to). To those who complain about getting the smell out of their clothes & hair, may I suggest the tool that all high schoolers who try to hide smells from their parents utilize: Febreeze.  Sometimes I crave that gross smell, smell of booze & cigarrettes, that smell of bar, it always felt so illicit, like you've been out doing naughty things. Coming home with clean clothes is so sanitary & boring. But that's just me.

It's been said before but I will reiterate it - if you are a rabid non-smoker, quitting smoking or just generally don't dig being around people who do smoke this is NOT the bar for you. Personally, I love this place...It's fun, laid back and unpretentious plus you can smoke inside (you gotta love that employee owned loop hole in the new laws)...The venue is like a well laid out 70's apartment...you walk in to a great bar area along with couple of nice loungey couch areas and a TV that is always playing some random Kung Fu or Western movie for ambiance. All-in-all, I highly recommend Amber and I will be going back...

This was my final New Years Eve destination so I am not sure I am qualified to write a review on it but here it goes, based solely on what I remember of this place;They only take cash, which is just a bad thing to tell a really drunk person, with no cash, AFTER you have poured them their drinks. The tender handled it well by suggesting that the orderer ask around to his circle of friends to get some cash. So....Chris turns to me, and of course I have just given the last of my cash to the cabbie who got us there, and at that point the tender just gave us the eye roll and the drinks and walked away. Free drinks score points.There is smoking allowed in this bar which takes a few of those hard earned points away in my book. I know it is nice to have a few bars around town where inside smoking is an option, but being as I went through the very tough struggle of quitting 2 years ago I dont like to be in said establishments where the carrot is dangling right there for me.......especially one where they serve alcohol. Its just a bad combo. So, that is what I remember, along with really icky bathrooms where the men dont get mad when the women cut in line (or maybe they do, and I was just too drunk to notice).

Best Indian restaurant I've ever been to and a nice restaurant in general. A very nice and chic restaurant with a fun bar and great food. I recommend the butter chicken and the lamb chops. There was no crowd and it didn't seem very social but rather intimate for an Indian restaurant. Very overpriced too...I guess they really make you pay for the atmosphere. Service is pretty good like B because no one knew what they had on the menu since it was recently changed.Try it out if you want to experience Eastern food in a Western atmosphere.

I am so unhip. My hip friend dragged me here after dinner Sat. night. I was wearing a black blazer and some blue & white striped shirt. I looked like a banker. It was awful. I was fairly certain I was going to be shot on site at Amber.But, you know what, it all worked out. Everyone was friendly and unpretentious. No one was staring at me - except for when I convinced my entire group to play the Punching Game, which is quite literally exactly what it sounds like. Oh, they also played the song You Are My Shining Star, which I unhiply referred to as the song from that Kodak commercial. Of course, this reference probably appalled 93.2% of the people in my immediate 5 ft. radius. But that didn't stop pretty much the whole bar from singing in unison to the song - which really was pretty cool.

One of my favorite bars of all time (weeknights). Smokey, good music, strong drinks, and comfortable. Not a big fan of the BNT crew on the weekends as it can get over crowded, but hey they gotta make a living. Other thing, there needs to be one bathroom for people to go to the bathroom, and one for the hipsters to go in groups to, so they can "powder their noses". People that work here are super nice too!

Don't smoke in here!Friend 2: But this is a SMOKING BAR.Friend 1: But you're making it worse!Friend 2: But this is a SMOKING BAR.(Friend 2 keeps smoking haha)Your eyes may be red at the end of the night and your chest might hurt the next morning but this bar is still really great. I'm not even a smoker (well, maybe I take a puff now and then) but I can appreciate the need for smoking bars. Sometimes it is just so damn cold in San Francisco and it really sucks for the smokers to have to stand outside. That's where bars like Amber come in. Not only do they allow smoking but they also make awesome drinks--and isn't that one of the most important things about a bar? I also love that there are tons of comfy seats.

I'm a smoker with tons of smoking friends so this place is automatically a preferred bar when we all go out to drink. They have deliciously comfortable couches to chill on which surely are much better when you're too drunk to wonder who else's butt has been in that spot before you. Never had any super disgusting trips to the bathroom either, which is really amazing for a bar loo.The drinks are reasonably priced and well mixed. Parking can be hard if you show up too late. You'd probably want to bus it so everyone can drink anyway.Depending on your intolerance towards second-hand smoke, you might not want to come here. None of my non-smoking friends have complained to me yet, nor have we had to leave because of such wimpyness. But you never know.

DRINKS: strong pours for real drinkers. prices would be reasonable for the wimpy glasses served in most bars--oversized glassware at amber means VALUE.AMBIANCE: falling apart but incredibly comfortable leather couches, old stereo units serving as coffee tables, brightly lit (for reading!), rotating local art adorning the walls (all up for sale), quirky cult movies on the old tv, and yes, smoking. a nice combination of design and dive. BARTENDERS: definitely the best reason to visit amber. they love to dress in costume for any random occasion--although for some reason amber "theme nights" are almost always "Yacht Nights." if phil (who was up for "hottest bartender in sf" on america online) and marcus are tending bar, be sure to stay until close just to hear their creative ways of kicking folks out. they never, ever repeat themselves. THE CROWD: amber gets the gamut, from sequined marina folks out "slumming," to local neighborhood schmucks like me. very mixed crowd in almost every possible way, and wonderful regulars. awfully packed on the weekends, though. BATHROOMS: need special mention. amber bathrooms are invariably foul, mostly due to the incredibly drunken yuppies who would never stop to think that human beings have to mop up their piss (and sometimes other things) off the floor. said yuppies spend most of their time at amber doing lines (in the bathrooms) in groups of 10 or more, while the rest of us just WAIT in line. bring galoshes to wade through the muck and bodily substances. really.or just hold it, because amber is definitely worth the visit.

i appreciate any variation of stickin' it to the man. finding a loophole to the 'no smoking in bars/restaurants' law deserves a round of applause. i'm not sure, however, it makes up for $8 well drinks, a severe lack of seating and a slightly annoying crowd. i've been told that the weekend brings a bit of a different vibe than the weekdays provide, so i'm sure it'd be worth coming back on say a tuesday night. the music was good and i liked the 70's basement feel, so its probably worth a second try.

Hipster meets homo.I can see this place in the Mission, with the hipsters and the PBR, except here, the hipsters are drinking PBR with a pinky up.Surprisingly, you can smoke inside here. Gross.Drinks are cheapish, there are dingy couches to crash on, and the line between homo and hipster is thin.Its fun nonetheless.

Bars do not get better than this.Great beer and great cocktails and great owners/bartenders and great atmosphere and you can smoke. This place fucking rocks.

For my pals that still light up, it's an oasis of nicotine-filled bliss. For me, the ashtrays that are never emptied are gross.
