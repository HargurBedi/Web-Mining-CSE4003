Over a year ago I contacted Waterbar at the last minute to help me celebrate my engagement. The Dead Fish restaurant, our first date location, refused to assist me with the simplest of requests, such as a pre-paid bottle of champagne. The Waterbar was able to accommodate me and worked with me to make it a special day. Today, I celebrated my 1 year anniversary and I could not think of a better place to start than the Waterbar. As expected, they took care of my requests and provided a great atmosphere. The food was excellent as usual and my wife and I were very happy.I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to everyone, both for the amazing food and the great customer service. Come celebrate your special day, its well worth it! They are forever a special spot for our new family!

They had their old webpage still indexed in Google that advertised daily $1 oyster happy hour, so I came with my boyfriend on a Saturday specifically for oyster happy hour. They told me the offer was no longer valid and did not offer to honor the deal or even provide a discount even though their webpage was still up showing the old deal as active (you can absolutely remove old pages from Google's index and take them offline for anyone to visit but the site's admin-- Waterbar's website administrator failed to do this and customers are expected to suck it up instead of Waterbar owning up to their technical mistake). They also put a surcharge on our bill for employee health care costs. Isn't caring for your employees just part of running a functioning business? Incredibly tacky & unclassy to itemize something like that. Not at all what I expect of a supposedly nice restaurant with the prices to match.

HH REVIEW ONLY:Oyster Special: M-F 11:30am-5:30pm.Drink Specials: M-F 2-5:30pm.Good luck getting a seat here around 5pm... I know everything in SF closes early so the earlier HH times make sense but good lord. It was like a war zone. We couldn't find a table for 3 so we just choose to stand by the bar area and just order some oysters/drinks and leave. The Oyster Special was just decent in my opinion. You are limited to an order of 24 per table... So if I wanted 24 for myself (and normally I do) I would come and eat here by myself lol. Still, if you usually order a smaller amount this is a decent deal. $1.05/featured oyster of the day. There were not that many options for the HH drink specials so I just ended up ordering a Grapefruit Vodka Cocktail on their normal menu for $13. My experience here would have been a little better if we were able to find seats/it wasn't so hectic. ALSO, a waiter who shall not be named spilled hot sauce all over my friend's purse when he was cleaning up after we were done... Said he would be back with his business card so she could follow up with him to get it cleaned... Waited for about 10 minutes for him to get back and when I looked around to see where he was he was at the bar making drinks...??? Poor service on his part. Especially since spilling sauce on my friends bag was completely his fault.

Today's (first time) visit went pretty smoothly. My hubster and I walked in around 1pm. Worried that we would have to wait since it was lunchtime-ish and we didn't have a reservation, we maybe waited about 5 minutes... then we were seated at a nice table by the window, score! After walking from Embarcadero Bart, sitting in this air conditioned ice box was heaven. Our server, Jerimiah was cool. He was quick and straight to the point. Towards the end of our visit he was more personable and we chatted about the weather. Thanks, for the good customer service today! They run a pretty good deal on oysters as their "Happy Hour" special, $1.05 per oyster... but these aren't what you expect. These things are tiny-shminy. I was shocked at the size, but my husband said they were good, so that's that. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach, so my bad. I guess taste always trumps price, right?! Ha.Okay, so he ordered the oysters of the day, & my appe consisted of 5 BBQ (yes, cooked!) oysters. These were good, but dang expensive. 5/$16, dannnnng. For our lunch plates I ordered the tuna over a salad. This was lightly, refreshing. I would totally order this again. My hubby ordered the tempura rock cod. This was pretty tasty. Combined with the cherry tomato, melon slices and each bite of cod, this combination of flavors was surprisingly tasty. Presentation of each dish was pretty on point. The feel of this restaurant can easily come off as bougie, but we walked in with flip flops and total summer chill fits. I would say for dinner, come suited and booted, but lunch is chill. Let me leave you with: this place is a cute date spot. Since it's located along Embarcadero and next to the Bay Bridge, I bet this place is super romantic at night/at sunset.

Came here for a wedding reception and this place was absolutely spectacular. The location is perfect. The backdrop of the bay and the bay bridge is amazing. As I walked up to the restaurant I could not stop looking at the bay. When you walk inside you immediately notice the big windows all along the walls and the big windows that face the bay. It makes for a very intimate evening or night if you're dining here. The reception that I was apart of held their reception upstairs but the downstairs is just as nice. There is a full bar downstairs along with tables that extended down the back of the restaurant. There is also some additional seating outside that I believe is typically reserved for small parties and groups. The reception upstairs was in a small room big enough for roughly 60 to 70 people, maybe. The room itself was well decorated and very vibrant. As you proceed up the stairs to the reception area you first encounter the bar area which was awesome. For the reception, it was an open bar which is always fun. The drinks were great and the service was fantastic. The food was just as great as the service. The steak was out of this world. I have had good steaks before but the one served here was just remarkable. I put the steak served here up there with some of the best I have ever had. The steak I had was so succulent that delicious that I wished I had ordered another, it was that good folks! Overall, it was an incredible meal. If you happen to be in the area and are able to dine here I would highly recommend it. For those of you that like to take pictures this place at night with the backdrop is an ideal spot for you. I would advise you that parking down here might be difficult to find so I recommend taking an Uber or a Lyft.The day was perfect. All the staff that contributed to the reception did an amazing job. The couple was pleased as were all the other guests in attendance. I cannot wait to come back again.#OhSoGood

Note: oyster happy hour is only Monday through Friday now. This is my go-to restaurant in SF! My boyfriend travel to SF just to visit! We've only ever come for the $1 oyster happy hour on weekends. However, we were disappointed to hear they discontinued oyster happy hour on the weekends during our most recent visit.We usually try to sit outside because it has a patio with an amazing view of the bridge. We have also sat inside and had equally as good service at the bar with a view of the bridge AND aquarium! I love the oysters and bread! Sometimes you had to request the bread and salted butter. I usually also order the fries and make sure to ask for garlic aioli. ITS AMAZING!

Happy hour Monday - Friday 11:30AM - 5:30 PM $1.05 oyster! Came here strictly for the oysters and they were very good, despite them being so small. Well in a way the smaller the oysters the more they taste good. They even have drinks specials on happy hour which is Monday - Friday 2:00PM- 5:30PM, I got the Aperol Spritz and it was pretty strong. Location- Right next to the bay bridge (Must sit outside, sometimes they don't open the outside which sucks ), parking may be hard but they do valet ( they charge, not sure how much but they change the prices quite often ). We end up taking a uber which was a great idea. The other food were okay, we got the fish and chips but it wasn't anything special. The only thing worth it here is the oysters and drinks! Also if it's your birthday they surprise you with a complementry dessert which is really nice.

Come early if you're here for oyster happy hour, especially on Friday afternoons. I tried coming once before around 4:30 and the place was already packed with a long line of people waiting outside for outdoor seating. This time around, I arrived at Waterbar around 4 pm on a Friday, hoping to have beaten the happy hour crowd, but alas, no such luck. My friend and I ended up standing along one of the tables. There are hooks for jackets and purses under the table so it actually wasn't too bad.Our orders were simple, we ordered a dozen oysters to share ($1.05/oyster) though they limit you to 24 oysters per table. Oysters were from Tomales Bay, which I'm not a huge fan of as they are very briny and too salty for my tastes. For my drink, I had the Aperol Spritz from the happy hour menu, which is aperol, orange, and prosecco ($9). I didn't know what aperol was before ordering this drink, but it was very bitter and I had a hard time finishing my drink. At least I've learned my lesson and will stay away from aperol-based drinks in the future.I walked away not super satisfied with my experience here, but that's a reflection on my tastes and what I ordered and not on the restaurant itself. I loved the atmosphere with the great Bay Bridge views, and service was prompt and attentive, so I'd like to come back again and give it another shot!

I came here with my friend on a Friday afternoon to get the $1 oysters. I believe they were about $1.25 to be exact but that's still pretty worth it. To by honest, I don't even like oysters, but I wanted to be fancy and try it out. It's pretty decent with the sauces that they provide (which I think were a hot sauce, tomato based one, and a ginger-y one). We also got their french fries, which were pretty good as well. We were actually missing an oyster, and they were super nice and apologetic about it. There is a wait for the outdoor seating since the area is pretty small, but there's a nice view of the water!

Great place to bring freinds or a special someone or even just family here. Bring a jacket because it does get really cold by the water. Food was amazing, no complaints.

The bartender, the manager and other staff members are really nice and friendly. The happy hour oysters are $1 each. The first batch could have been cleaned better, with a bit too much grit. The second batch was much cleaner, allowing us to enjoy the oysters more. The cocktails are varied, and the happy hour wine selections are decent. Great views, with indoor fish tanks and outside bay and bridge.

We went out for a fancy lunch date on Friday at Waterbar. The weather was perfect and I wish we could have sat outside. That said, the inside set up was very nice as well. I was surprised by how reasonably priced the prix fixe menu was. For $25, it comes with 3 courses and the menu changes daily. I had 5 Oysters Rockefeller, a huge portion of Fish & Chips, and an ice cream sandwich. My date proclaimed these to be the best oysters he has ever had (I'm not sure if I would go that far but they were damn good!) and proceeded to get a second order of the oysters. Although the fish & chips were a bit soggy, I could taste the high quality ingredients. By this point (also because I had some of the wonderful complimentary bread), I was so stuffed.And then the ice cream sandwich came out. It was cut in half and perfect for us to share. They say sharing is caring ad I'd recommend doing what we did - order one prix fixe menu and one separate entree and share everything.

This review is solely for the oyster happy hour, I've never tried the lunch or dinner menus. You really get your money's worth for the $1 oysters and cheap happy hour beers and wine. I took a star off because sometimes the oysters can be extremely tiny and not properly shucked. I've swallowed a lot of shell during my many happy hours. However, the happy hour is EXTREMELY popular so you'll have to get there around 4pm to guarantee that you'll get a seat in my experience (unless you get lucky).[Happy Hour]Bring a friend. First order two beers. Order 24 oysters for $1 each. Order fries to share. Sit and watch the sunset and the Bay Bridge light up and think about how happy your are to be in San Francisco. Leave extremely happy.[Service]They are a bit short-staffed during happy hour, but the waiters are very friendly. The people who are waiting for a seat at the bar or one of the few small tables can be extremely rude. I will leave when I've paid my bill. Please don't stand an inch from my ear and breath down my neck. That's not going to make me leave any faster.

Waterbar has a very special place in my San Francisco heart.I've only gone to Waterbar with coworkers - only a short stroll from our office, this is our go-to place to have celebratory lunches or 1-on-1 meetings. Waterbar has been the backdrop of heartfelt conversations with my colleagues. The joint has an amazing view of the Embarcadero and San Francisco Bay Bridge and daily oyster specials ($1.05 each, 24 oysters max per order).Definitely try the assortment of oysters with fish and chips (they're actually fries - even better) with some proseco.

I love the friendly staff, amazing view, and great seafood options. I came in with a couple coworkers for lunch and tried the basil lemonade, miso marinated halibut tartare, pan seared walu, and vanilla chiffon cake. The basil lemonade was okay. I liked the refreshing taste of basil with lemon but it was a little too sour for my liking. The halibut tartare was amazing, get one to share with some friends! There's no way I could've finished an appetizer, entree, and dessert on my own for lunch. The halibut is well-seasoned, and I loved the mix of textures with the creamy avocado and crispy chips. The walu was also really good- although I wasn't a huge fan of the corn ravioli because it was a bit soggy, not al dente. I thought the vanilla chiffon cake was okay. The cake was dry but the flavors of the blackberry and thyme paired really well together. The staff here is very accommodating to any dietary restrictions or personal preferences. One of my coworkers is incredibly picky and our server was patient and made great recommendations. I'll definitely be back soon to try the happy hour menu that everyone talks about!

Had a wonderful experience here. Came here with my boyfriend for our 5 year anniversary with reservations on a Wednesday night at 8:45pm.Food/drink: we started with champagne and bread. The bread was warm and tasted very fresh. I wanted to eat it all but we had food coming. We got a round of oysters (it was my first time trying them). The oysters had good sauce to put on them (lemon, red wine sauce, and some type of ketchup sauce). The taste of them were great but it was hard to deal with the texture. My boyfriend loved them though and had had oysters before. Next we got the seared scallops appetizer which I also haven't ever tried before. The scallops were delicious, so tender and flavorful. After this we both got the lobster entree which was actually a lot of food. The lobster had a good rich flavor I just wish they gave more lemons with it to balance the flavors. Lastly we got panna cotta dessert. It was a little weird at first but we ended up loving it and eating every bite. They wrote happy anniversary on the dessert which was special. Service: Our server was great. She came around whenever we needed her, gave us time to look at the menu, and also gave great recommendations. She also comped us some dessert champagne for the special occasion. Our water was always refilled and she took great photos of us. Ambiance: As you walk in it was pretty loud and busy. Definitely a good sign when a restaurant is packed on a Wednesday night. We ended up going to the furthest room in the restaurant where it was quieter and more private. We got a perfect view of the lit up bay bridge and it was amazing.Would for sure come back for a special occasion. The dinner ended up being pretty expensive, but we figured it would be. Thanks for the great food and experience!

Oysters are $1.50 each ALL DAY, but you must order at the bar. As a result the bar area is SUPER PACKED, while the rest of the restaurant is near empty. While oysters are affordable, everything is extremely overpriced. $12 for a weak cocktail, $9 shoestring fries, $11 for chips and goat cheese dip. Service was forgetful of the items we ordered.The view is gorgeous, overlooking the bay and the newly constructed/renovated bridge. Good luck snagging a seat.

No more $1 oysters on the weekend? Very disappointing. While most of Waterbar's menu is overpriced, this was always the one thing that got us in the door. When we asked about the $1 oysters, we were told to try the 20% off half a dozen oyster "special" for $20. This was our local spot... brought family friends on the weekend... always ended up walking out with a large bill, but PLENTY OF OYSTERS.......Went from being a regular Saturday/Sunday spot to... guess we'll see...

Came here for happy hour while on an adventure in the city and partook in the happy hour oyster session. The concept of an extremely long happy hour was very interesting, and the session is run on a first come first served arrangement which makes for an interesting experience when waiting for a space. Unfortunately, being a fairly patient person we loitered on the stairs between the open bar and lobby for about an hour before sitting at a small high top in a corner. The drink menu for happy hour is fairly limited, but features a selection appropriate for a quick oyster session. The oysters are ok- fairly fresh but not very flavorful and the cocktail sauce is nothing to write home about. The french fries are very normal, come in a large portion and serve well for snacking. Overall the ambiance ranks highest, with a beautiful view of the bay, an impressive indoor aquarium and both standing and sitting options for happy hour. Interesting place to stop by but average food.

Came here on a Saturday with a girl friend of mine and we unfortunately forgot to make a reservation. We both thought that it wouldn't be busy, but then we realized what a nice day it was outside and was worried we wouldn't be able to get a table. We waited by the banana table for a spot at the bar to open up and finally got one! We decided to get the ceviche and dozen oysters to share. The ceviche was AMAZING - I have never seen ceviche served with apricots instead of just mangos or tomatoes, so it was a really nice change! The oysters were delicious and fresh! Will definitely be back soon!

True Rating: 3.5This rating is about the NYE pre fixed menu. For $135 dollars, you get your worth of food. Portions are pretty big and selection is great, (mostly seafood).I ordered:Tiger Prawn (as appetizer): Pretty delicious, prawn is huge and inside the prawn as seaweed. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The sauce was too salty though, therefore I refuse to dip lolLobster (another starter): OK, lobster was very soft and not chewy at all. That's when you know its not fresh. It wasn't bad, but just wasn't good as I expectedBass (entree): OK, I like the mash potatoes on the side, but the bass itself was dryLemon Tart (dessert): The ice cream on the top was the best, the cake itself was too sweet.At the end, the restaurant was gave us some goodies and a bottle of champagne per couple. The view was amazing and you can see the fireworks bright and clear outside. You are honestly paying for the view and the atompshere. It is a fun place to be in NYE!

We came here during happy hour and the $1 oysters of the day were Miyagis. The service at this place is impeccable our server was very friendly and was more than happy to explain some of the other menu items. We decided on two dozen oysters, the herbed goat cheese dip ($10), and the happy hour beer ($7). The oysters were shucked well but a few of the oysters did taste really fishy, the goat cheese dip was nothing special and definitely lacked some flavor.This place gets 4 stars because of the amazing views of the Bay Bridge and the excellent service. This place definitely can expand there beer selection a bit more and the $7 happy hour beer is far from a deal.

I wish I could give this place a higher rating. My first impression when I walked in was wow! Beautiful ambience! And love the view of the bay bridge! My bf and I walked in and unfortunately wished that someone directed us as to what we should do upon entering. We were standing at the front for a good 10 minutes and the people working there actually made contact with us but ignored the fact that we were standing there. A little later someone approached us and said "oh it's happy hour sit anywhere you'd like" if only they had a sign to let us know that or someone could've approached us sooner. We sat down and our main purpose on coming here was to eat fresh oysters! You may order 2 dozen at a time and we ended up ordering 4 dozen... yes we love oysters that much! We had a couple drinks and they were ordinary, nothing special. Overall, it's a beautiful setting and would only come in for the $1.05 oysters. But unfortunately service wasn't as great, esp with what happened in the beginning as well as our waiter disappearing often.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but never got to until now. First off the location is awesome along the Embarcadero. The ambiance was really nice, it's a more upscale place. Reservations seem get full easily but the bar area is first come first serve and they do have some round tables that seat up to 4.They have aquariums within the columns so it's a nice touch. This place has a nice dimly lit ambiance so good for intimate dinner or drinks with friends. Food was pretty good although the menu was a bit limited. The waiter said the menu does change everyday though. If you love seafood go to this place. If you don't there won't be many choices. Drinks were pretty good too! Lots of variety of wines and cocktails to choose from, the pages go on and on within that menu.

Waterbar is situated near the foot of the Bay Bridge, and features a menu that is updated daily, several floor-to-ceiling aquariums in the dining area, excellent service, fabulous views of the bridge, a huge selection of fresh oysters, and several fresh seafood dishes to choose from. Our party of 4 sat at a nice table by the window with a great view of the bridge (and also a view of a homeless guy who had parked himself on a bench just outside our window). I'll admit that I did feel a bit guilty devouring my lobster salad and a $19 plate of oysters, while a less fortunate soul sat just a few feet outside our window.So why only 3 stars? Well, I guess it comes down to presentation and the fact that several dishes that we ordered were far too salty. As far as seafood is concerned, our party ordered the Steamed Alaskan Halibut, the seared Ling Cod, and the Bacon-Wrapped Monkfish. (I ordered the Rack of Lamb). The portions are modest in size, but if you've filled up on appetizers and bread, that really isn't an issue. Note that this review is based on a single visit. It's always possible the chef was having an off day, or maybe someone accidentally spilled salt into the Shellfish Egg Drop Soup. On the other hand, several of the reviews here mention the excessive salt, so I'm thinking that it isn't just me.

I love perfection. Waterbar is that for me.Over the years I've had some outstanding and not so great experiences but when I average them out, I admit, when I want a lovely fuss free lunch- this is where I go. This is the place I recommend. This is where I am happiest.I love the relaxing feel of the dining area with the fishtank beams. I love looking out the window at the bay with the bridge as the backdrop. I love the way the wait staff are attentive but not intrusive so I have all of my needs met without feeling rushed. I love having JW Blue. I love their perfect wine storage - makes splurging on a spendy one to celebrate more reasonable than bringing my own. I love having a glass of wine by the stem. Instead of committing to an entire bottle, you have a remarkable list of offerings you can enjoy and who knows? You might unearth a new wine to love! (The suggested white wine pairing with fresh oysters? Brilliant!) I love the local sustainable seafood options presented/prepared in a variety of ways so you never feel bored. I love the elegance of multiple utensils and plates because it makes me feel fancy. I love the valet right outside for so I can wear the highest heels and the smallest dress.I love that I know what I'm going to experience every time I come here. I love feeling fancy sometimes. Waterbar does that for me. Waterbar, this is my love letter to you for so many memorable lunches and dinners over the years. Take a bow. Five stars for excellence.

Back in the day, WaterBar and Epic used to be our Happy Hour spot on Friday's after work. It's really impressive how this restaurant has remained relevant and fresh. We had lunch here for my gf's bday. We walked up without reservations and got lucky with outdoor seating. My gf and I decided to order 3 apps to share and a side of fries. It was so delicious that I want to come back again soon and try the main courses! Impeccable service, a fresh presentation on seafood (think seasonal stone fruit, raw fish, nuts, micro greens, spice), excellent wine menu + virgin drinks (lemonade w/basil), lovely seating indoor or out with amazing view of Bay Bridge or their own aquarium + giving our dog a chef made peanut butter dog biscuit gets 5 stars. Bravo and thank you.

We had a party of 4 there today, dropped $1,000 and not really having any lunch at all. The shellfish grand platter ($110) was amazing. Nothing was short from flavor from fish egg rolls to steak with peppers; although the duck tortellini was extremely small and not worth the price.... All in all the food and service was excellent.

Great for really large groups and the prices are reasonable during lunch (~$20) especially for a nice restaurant. Service is attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is on the fancier side and the views are beautiful.I got the oyster po' boy which came with chips. The bread was perfectly toasted and delicious. I really enjoyed the fried oysters I only wish they had given more!

You can't go to San Francisco without having $1 Raw Oysters. One of the many top places that I love going to.This time I went after happy hour which ends at around 5:30pm. So make sure you get there at around 5 if you plan on taking advantage of the happy hour. You don't have to wait if you plan on eating at the bar but if you plan on getting a table inside or on the patio, try to make a reservation just to be safe.

Got a window side table. Great view of the bridge right out front. Simple menu with good selection of oysters and drinks. The duck and steak dish were surprisingly better compared to the sea bass and halibut entry. We had Chris as our server. He's not only knowledgeable but also attentive and sweet. Did I say he's a hottie too? Ha. Overall a cool place to hang out at esp. if you can make it to their happy hour.

GREAT LOCATION! The view of the Bay Bridge was a nice compliment to the amazing food and wonderful service! We sat at the bar, and were constantly being checked in on by the bartender and other staff. Everyone was very friendly, and chatty. The food was equally enjoyable-- oyster platter, peach salad and filet were all delicious!Would highly recommend this restaurant.

Beautiful restaurant established in a great location. The restaurant sits right next to the Bay Bridge, walking distance from the bay front. Picture perfect at anytime of the day. The inside is gorgeous and eccentric. The food is delicious, with unique flavors and fresh ingredients. The service was spot on and attentive. Definitely going back on my next trip to SF.

Bloody Mary Review - If I had a hot date, I'd take them to brunch at Waterbar. I'd also try to avoid ogling the super cute bartenders. But that's neither here nor there. I'd order a dozen chef selected oysters and of course, Te Ultimate Bloody Mary. Your date, my imaginary date, would be presented with a fresh platter of oysters shucked to order and a massive tomato based cocktail spiked with three ounces of Ketel One vodka, two giant prawns, two strips of bacon, a cucumber slice to hold it all together, and a signature house-made Old Bay seasoned rim. Trust me. Why go? Hot date approved. | Price: $24

Forgot ceviche but still a cool experience...Took the scenic walk along the Embarcadero from BART. 15 minutes, but felt like an eternity with the three of us stopping to take pictures every few feet. Originally, we were supposed to come solely for their happy hour oysters, later planning to grab dinner at a hot pot place down by Union Square. Anyways, we went in, mesmerized by the floor to ceiling glass window framing the Bay Bridge. We took about 5 mins as a group to decide whether we wanted to sit inside or out, always a tough decision in chilly but scenic places....we decided on outside which was the right choice. The vista was incredible, the flora was easy on the eyes, and the breeze was actually kind of nice. All the tables were heated outside anyways haha. We sat right down knowing we gonna get the $1 oysters, a ton of them, but some other menu items caught our eyes, like the ceviche, lamb riblets, chips and dips, and an order of 6 bbq oysters. They brought out our food and after we took their artsy yelp pics and ig stories we dug in. The oysters were presented beautifully on a two tier plate with kelp strewn around along with the sauces necessary for the oysters. The BBQ oysters were presented in a similar fashion. One who shall not be named asked if he was supposed to eat the kelp . The ceviche also came out and and was presented in a kind of cylinder shape with tortilla chips. Super annoying when restaurants don't include chips with their ceviche (*cough cough* Parada.) Its like buying a drink and having to pay for extra for the straw. The restaurant wasn't super busy so our waiter leaned up against the wall and watched us eat which was uncomfortable, but we tried to ignore it. We loved the ceviche so much that we decided to add another to our next round along with lamb riblets, goat cheese chips and dip, along with another 10 oysters, bringing our total to 40 or so. They brought out the next round of oysters with the riblets and chips. We didn't realize they didn't bring the ceviche out, which they charged us for, we were already. Overall, a nice time in the city. Would have been nice if they brought us what we paid for....

You know what I love? A good pickle. If a menu has anything pickled, most likely I'll get it. Pickles are great.When I saw that Waterbar had a side dish called "New Pickles", I had to get it. I mean... NEW. pickled? What's new about it? Had to find out. I also had the mussels and the table ended up getting about 60 oysters. The happy hour oysters are still $1.25 and relatively decent. Meaning, I didn't get sick.This 2 star review is for the pickles. What I got was L I T E R A L L Y a bowl of whole cucumbers, sprinkled with brine water.SERIOUSLY.I was going to lose my sh.t. I am shocked some chef in the back came up with his pathetic dish, and someone else approved it. WHY.This isn't amateur hour. If I wanted WHOLE CUCUMBERS WITH LIGHT SALT WATER, I would have driven to Safeway and gotten it myself.No, I'm not expecting 3 Michelin star miracle pickles. But Jesus, you could have at least pretended like you tried.I'm embarrassed for the chef who thought of this "new pickles". Then again, I paid $6 for what I can only describe as an unimaginative and lazy "interpretation" of pickles.My advice is to look up how to make pickles and just follow the recipe. Really, any will do.And for those that say, omg you're so harsh. My 4 stars for their oysters is below (so avg of 3 stars), and like I said in the beginning, I LOVE PICKLES.

The location is excellent right on the bay with a great view of the bay bridge. The food is about average. Coming in for brunch is a great idea as it feels fresh and very much makes you feel like a great start for your day. Night time is also very nice as the view of the lit up bay bridge is one of a kind. The place is spacious and has multiple seating arrangements including outdoor.

Really great happy hour. We sat on the outside patio and had oysters and drinks. Then got the goat cheese dip with chips. The dip is fantastic - an herbed goat cheese with a balsamic drizzle. We also got the cucumber Collins which was so good and refreshing. Highly recommend for a great happy hour spot!

Damn, $1.05 for Miyagi's? I say, Hell yeah!! I came here just for this spectacular HH I've been hearing about. Hell, I don't care what other foods or drinks they have on that menu, all I know is that they have $1 oysters in the half shell! Sure, some peeps gripe it's a small oyster, they want the larger ones. But if you know oysters, size doesn't matter! The Miyagi's are small but the quality and taste surpasses the larger ones. We chose to sit outside and take advantage of the beautiful backdrop. With the Bay Bridge in full view, and clear blue sky, it's quite a setting. Our server was great,she was pleasant and attentive. I'd definitely go back if given the chance!

We came for a work dinner and I was very impressed. The service was impeccable and the food was very tasty. Definitely a seafood spot with limited choices otherwise so be prepared for fish if you are going here with any non-seafood eaters. We were able to sit by the window and look out at the bridge and water while we ate. Really amazing views! Definitely would recommend to others and be sure to make a reservation before!

I came here just for oysters...had 24 to myself! Service is polite but can be a bit slow, however, the oysters were very fresh, and you cannot beat the gorgeous view. You sit right next to the Bay Bridge! I would go back and try other menu items.

This place is uber fancy and most people who dine here probably come for business. It's a fancy seafood restaurant right by the water so you really just end up paying for the view, let's be real.Came here for a business outing with the team. I ordered the white cod with brussel sprouts and some kind of pudding. It was not tasty at all but was VERY bland. I guess I'm asking too much for my fish to house some sort of flavor but nawwww this was as white as can be. At least the raw seafood platter was good! Shrimp was large and sweet.All in all, I would never come here on a whim unless I wanted to impress someone, or shmooze whatever you call it.

ONE DOLLAR OYSTERS?! LET'S GO TO WATERBAR.PROS:- Happy Hour $1.05 Oysters DAILY (11:30 AM - 5:30 PM)- Beautiful view of the Bay Bridge. Indoor/outdoor seating.- Lovely ambiance (cute for a date or a fancy event)- Their fries were delicious!CONS: - Service was slow, but it might've been a hectic day and short staff.- Our waiter was a bit short with us and inattentive - I ordered the Grilled Flat Steak Iron for $23. Food portions were small and tasted okay. My friends also felt dissatisfied with their entrees.Overall, it was an okay experience. I'd only come back here for the Happy Hour oysters, the fries, and the view!

I needed a last minute reservation at a specific time and have never dined at this establishment before. I spoke with an employee over the phone who's name is Pearl. I was so impressed with the conversation, she went above and beyond to help accommodate my needs and never made me feel like it was a hassle rather, took satisfaction that she was able to help! I have dined at some of the nicest restaurants in the bay area but what stands out to me the most is when people are kind, respectful and go above and beyond for a new client. Great job Pearl!! I very much appreciate it!!

3.5 stars. 5 stars for the amazing view but 3 for the food and service.The view: You get to see the bay bridge! It's so pretty at night, and there is outdoor seating. Indoors, there are two standing pillar aquariums that are quite beautiful. Service:Our waiter was nice, kind, and attentive. However, food took forever to come! I don't know if it's like this everyday, but the wait for our food after our appetizers and even for dessert and the bill was crazy long. We ended up staying for 3 hours. I understand it gets busy, they were probably short staffed. Food:I ordered a few oysters, had a mojito, the white fish entree, and split the blueberry bread and lavender pudding dessert. Overall, the food was okay, but for the price (entree around $40) I think I could've spent it better somewhere else.Overall, a great experience. The view was amazing, but the food a bit pricey and service was okay. I would come back for happy hour oysters.

Loved this place! My friend and I were visiting SF for the week and decided to give this place a try. We arrived at 9:30 pm for our reservation. We were greeted by two wonderful hosts. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. It seemed very busy, but the staff took the time to chat us up, introduce themselves and ask for our names, and make casual small talks. The food was amazing, kind of pricey though. I do want to take the time to show appreciation for our waiter Nicholas. I would definitely go with his recommendations. He is the definition of hospitality. Always checking in on us, making sure we have any questions, great enthusiasm, and attitude. He even asked if we needed guidance around town.

As I sit here at Waterbar, I'm writing this review about your Dining Room Manager Jensen. My friend and I were having an amazing time for happy hour at 2:30pm. The general manager of the restaurant was kind enough to seat us immediately outside instead of resorting to inside. That was extremely generous of him. Then we had an amazing waiter who was very attentive to our drink and food orders, and checked up on us often.5pm came around and we received word that 1-2 friends may join our table. We told our server immediately and he said he would put the request in for a larger table. One friend showed up, and I let our server know he was here, so he could determine what we should do. He mentioned he put the request in but it hadn't been looked at yet. He came back around and said it would be okay to grab another chair to add onto our 2 person table while I moved out of the fire hazard way to be against the wall and not in danger of the servers' walkway. I looked at Jensen come by to the empty table and immediately notice her "wtf face" in the fact there was only one chair at the table next to us. Here's where the issue starts. Instead of trying to figure out the history of the situation, she assumed we had just moved a chair without anyone's permission. She came over and told us it was against policy to have more than 2 chairs at a table and we would have to get up from our table and get back in the waiting line to get a larger table. Uhhhhh.... who does that? We were courteous enough to not lash out at her at the time, moved inside at a table at the bar, and that's when our server kindly told us that an outdoor table of 4 was opening up and we could sit there.Note: All it takes is some respect and courtesy of your patrons and we are completely understanding. However, her bitchy assuming approach was just not executed correctly, and it was apparent she had zero experience in customer service unlike everyone else at the restaurant. I'm appalled that someone could be employed there as she straight up lied when I saw a long table of business patrons, and it was apparent they had squeezed in at least 2 chairs to accommodate that party... enough said.

Where do i start... I was conflicted with giving this place either 3 stars or 4. But the view is amazing so I'll go with four. Luckily we made a reservation before coming here so we didn't have to wait. The food was delicious but such small portions for a high price. I ordered the pumpkin pasta and I literally got four pieces of pasta. It was delicious and it made me somewhat full but you should have seen my face when they brought it out. Unfortunately I forgot to take a pic of the portion. We also got oysters and fries ! The service ... kind of slow but they are all super nice. When you're done eating you can go outside towards the water and see the bay bridge super close. Perfect setting for pictures ! #DoItForTheSnap Overall good experience.

Three words: ONE DOLLAR OYSTERS.That's all you need to get at Waterbar and you will be one happy camper. Stopping by for lunch with my sister and brother-in-law, I was stunned at how crazy busy the place was. But after taking a good look around, I could definitely see why. Not only does the restaurant have one of the most beautiful views of San Francisco, but the interior design itself is just as breathtaking. Large cylinder aquariums that reach all the way to the ceiling housed giant groupers and beautiful corals. Bright velvet seats were situated around the bar and beautiful wooden tables were found on the main floor. Because we were only there to snack on some oysters, we chose to wait around in the lounge area for a table to open up. It was pretty packed so we weren't able to get a table until after 30 minutes or so, but once seated we were given clean plates, utensils, and glasses of water. My brother-in-law had also ordered a plate of ceviche and while the fish was unbelievably fresh and delicious, we did feel that, as a whole, the appetizer was very overpriced, especially for the amount we got. But when our tray of 24 oysters hit our table, my jaw dropped open in awe. Wonderfully presented on a bed of ice with a delicate piece of seaweed strewn across, the oysters almost looked too beautiful to eat. ALMOST. But after that first slurp, I basically downed five more without a single thought. So fresh, so smooth, and so refreshing, those oysters were so delicious that I'm drooling about them right now. And at $1 each, it was basically a steal.So while the other foods at Waterbar may be overpriced (and possibly even over-hyped), their oysters are so amazing that not getting those would be a crime. Definitely just stop by for those!
