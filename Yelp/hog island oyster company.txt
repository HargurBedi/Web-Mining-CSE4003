Does not take reservation but oh boy it was worth the wait! The best and most fresh oyster I have ever had. The service was very fast (I guess they are used to being super over crowded) We went on a weekend and the line was 2 hours long. The line was out door so be prepared for weather (It was ridiculously hot when I went). You can buy a drink (or two) while you wait. They have kind of a bar/ cocktail table where you can put your drinks at the waiting line. The restaurant seat people whenever there is a table open. So even if you are at the front of the line and your part has 4 people, and there are 2 seats open first, they are going to seat any party of 2 first before they get to you.We ordered fresh oyster of course and they are amazing. They offer a variety of oyster and all of them were good. We also had mussel dish and clam chowder. Both of them are amazing too. The broth were flavorful and seafood was so fresh. It also fills your tummy quickly too! This is one of the pricier places in SF because it is in one of the hottest tourist attraction (duh) and the business is so good. If you are new to SF, definitely try this. But if I were to live here, once is good for me considering the high price and the super long line

My friend took us here when we went on our trip to San Fran. Came at a good time, didn't really need to wait long to be seated (as my friend said, we got pretty lucky) We obviously had to order oysters! We tried the raw and baked ones. They were great and the view was awesome! We sat outside and it was such a good atmosphere and environment. They provide you with bread before your food comes out, and honestly even their bread was good. This spot is in a good location if you're exploring the city and trying to find a place to eat!

Great service, great oysters, great time! Parking is a pain, as many reviews have mentioned. But, once you finally make it to your oysters it will have been worth it.

A trip to San Francisco wouldn't be complete without dining here!I didn't make reservation this time cause me and my friend spontaneously decided to stopped here before we head out for our flight to LA.Parking here can be a hassle they have valet at the pier, but its not a guaranteed. Your best bet is to uber here if you live around the area. To start off, we order their raw oyster, Superb! Also we tried their famous clam chowder and seafood stew. This restaurant is located on the pier right next to the beach. So the view was beautiful!

Alright, real talk moment. I don't like oysters. There, I said it. But when you're in a group and everyone wants to eat oysters, you just kinda stay quiet and tag along for the ride. "But Jonathan, you just gave this place a 5 star review?"Au contraire mon amie, I've learned that I just don't like RAW oysters and there's very much so more to eat here at Hog Island. Cue the remainder of this review.It isn't fair for me to try to evaluate the huge platter of oysters my friends ordered, despite them force feeding me two of them. However, they did do me a solid and ordered the grilled Worcestershire oysters. These are such a game changer, please for the love of all things delicious, order these! Coming from an avid hater of raw oysters, these opened my eyes to the truth.We also ordered the fish sliders which were a tad dry and not all that flavorful. I'd say just skip out on those and order another round of the aforementioned grilled oysters.

Oysters!!! I love oysters and what better place to get oysters than while in San Francisco! The restaurant is located in the Ferry Building a short walk from the Cupid's Span (giant bow and arrow). Ferry building contains several shops and eateries but also Hog Island Oysters! Having to of tried their clam chowder the previous day at the chowder festival I figure I come for a full bowl and other goodies. I got half a dozen oysters to start. Picked out two of my favorites from the menu. Kumamoto and Island Creek. They were absolutely fresh, sweet, and delicious! Totally should of gotten 6 more. I went ahead with the clam chowder, some old bay fries, and steamed clams. At first when the chowder arrived it looked like a bunch of stuff you were sure if it would be tasty. But it was soo tasty! You can totally taste the hint of bacon and clams in the broth. As a side note if you are used to thinking clam chowder should taste thick like Boudin, it is not like that there. My son loves his Boudin and was very shocked at himself he cleaned out his bowl here! The steamer clams I got were also incredibly delicious. The wine and butter chorizo broth was just perfect for the bread to soak up the juices. Overall I was very happy to of stopped by since everything was delicious. The waiter and waitresses were all on top of their game with removing plates, taking orders and getting your check quickly without feeling rushed at all.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon, after the late lunch hour and too early for dinner. There was a line, but the wait wasn't too long. We were sat very quickly..... LOCATION: Located in the ferry building next to all the amazing little shops, water side of the building.. which also allows you to have a nice view of the bay bridge while you enjoy dinner.PARKING: luckily we found metered street parking across the street of the ferry building. SERVICE: the host and server were both welcoming, very prompt and also recommended a few menu items.FOOD: Oysters! Fresh, delicious, get in my belly! I enjoyed their grilled cheese sandwich and their clam chowder, and of course their oysters!!!!!!This place is a perfect for a light lunch/dinner and is in the perfect location that overlooks the bay bridge. Yelpers loved it so it was definitely worth a try! I loved it!

This place is always packed. Come on off times and you will still have to wait in line. The line up is on the pier side/outside of the restaurant. We walked thru the meat store and then to the outside which was fine. And only had to wait 10 min for a table on a Tuesday at 2:30pm Service was great. No complaints here. She even suggested we do the oyster sampler and we can choose which ones we wanted since we couldn't decided. Delicious also ordered the grilled oysters. 4 to an order and she also said we could split on flavours. We got the traditional Florentine and then the chipotle bourbon. Spinach was good but omg. Chipotle bourbon??? Might be my new favourite cooked oyster flavour! This is a must try!! It's not over powering at all We also had the steamers (clams) and a side order ofFries. Yumyumtym. They were kind enough to split the order for us so we can soak up the sauce and not to fight over it hahaHighly recommend this for anyone!

Boyfriend and I decided to venture out to SF and I always wanted to try Hog Island ever since I was a broke high schooler.We came on Saturday morning and lined up around 10:30AM. I heard the line gets crazy so best to come right before they open and stand in line. (FYI we stood in line at 10:30 and there were still many groups ahead of us).When it hit 11AM we were able to pick where we seated and we decided to sit inside.I suggest not coming with a big group of people. Most of the seating is at the bar.I can't imagine coming with more than 4. We ordered:-Raw Oyster Dozen Sampler-Raw Clams-Clam Chowder-Some beer and wineThe clam chowder seemed popular so we ordered the clam chowder as an appetizer to share with my boyfriend. The calm chowder pictures on yelp made me have high expectations. I expected the soup to have rich big clams but instead we had small little clams. The soup base is rich and creamy but I was expecting more juicy clams. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it though.Next time I could opt without it. (Get more raw oysters instead, heh heh)The raw oyster sampling was great. I didn't know oysters had different taste and trying them really opened my eyes to all the varieties of oysters. I honestly can't remember all of them but the gold was my personal favorite.The raw clams were good, mellow.But the star of the show are them oysters.Next time I really want to order my own dozen of oysters to eat and not share.Had a great time enjoying the views and eating my white wine and oysters.

Very hard to find parking.. we parked on the street a few blocks away. This location is located in the back, the instructions/address provided just states it is in the building. When we were searching for this restaurant it was located right after the meat section of a store. But there is also a way to enter from the back (we did not know that).The waiting area to be seated is also in the back of the restaurant. We did not wait too long.The server assisting us was very helpful, we loved how informative he was and we enjoyed hearing his recommendations. Oysters were very delicious and hey fun fact: we did not know there were different types of oysters to order! Like some may be smaller than others or saltier. It was such a good experience.

There are surprisingly not that many places to get fresh oyster in the Bay Area, and as such it was not surprising there was a long queue to get into this one. That combined with its location in the Ferry Building almost guaranteed a wait. We didn't mind though. We were seated at a long common table, and as such got to know the people next to us who were visiting the area.We ordered the oyster bar mix, a bowl of the clam chowder, and a grilled cheese sandwich. I'm not a fan of oysters, but my boyfriend is, and he even convinced me to try one. I can't say I'm hooked, but it was indeed tasty. He was completely satisfied with the oysters.The clam chowder was so full of clams it was ridiculous. It was truly delicious, and we both really enjoyed it.The grilled cheese sandwich was above average, and very tasty. Excellent choices of cheese inside, and it was grilled so that the excess cheese was melted into a hard crunchy cracker-like piece that was just heaven to eat.Overall a very yummy experience. We will probably visit again!

I can't believe I never wrote a review for one of my favorite places in SF! This is a must eat whenever I go visit SF. Their oysters are super fresh and yummy. The have my favorite clam chowder soup where they use real shell clams. I'm not a big fan of the new england clam chowder because of it being super creamy and thick soup. The clam chowder here is not very thick, super flavorful and not too much overloaded with potatoes. It's really the best. We always get the mix oysters so I always forget which one I like the best, but seriously they are all pretty good. If I didn't have the need to have my clam chowder, I could really eat like a dozen by myself :)

So worth the travel, wait and money (especially if you can get a seat outside.)Located at the ferry building market place, Hog Island is where you'd want to spend a beautiful afternoon enjoying fresh oysters and cocktails. The only issue with drinks is that the straws are paper. Cute, but annoying and kinda gross after awhile. Ask your server about the oysters if you aren't familiar with them. They're all very knowledgeable and happy to explain!Oysters are always fresh, and it's a given that you order some when you're here. I also really enjoy the mussels & the acme bread that they give. Each time I'm here, my party & I ask for bread at least 4-5 times... it's just that good.If you have some time to spare, ask to sit outside. It's dark inside & I definitely spent half my time dining wishing we asked to be seated outside instead! Line may be long but it moves fast, especially if you're a party or 2 or 1.

I loveeee hog island oyster co. Sitting at the bar watching them make the dishes is quite mesmerizing and the oysters are always fresh and tasty!The clam chowder is good but definitely on the liquidy side (not thick like I'm use to). The gumbo (a special) was super tasty and I would definitely recommend this dish! It's loaded with tons of sea food and rice and is just delicious! I never wanna wait in line but it honestly goes pretty fast so I definitely recommend this place for locals and tourists! P.S. the butter (for the bread) is soooo good!

The oysters! We had the grilled oysters - Chipotle bourbon and worcestershire - and they were simply out of the world. We also had the clam chowder, which was ok and the mussels which were good.The line to get seated is quite long, we were here around 1 and had a 30 minute wait. Smaller parties get seated quicker. Service was good and the food is out quickly. The oysters are definitely worth the line and wait. Must go!

Hog Island IS WORTH THE WAIT!! I know some people get discouraged by the long wait outside that wraps a couple times, but trust me you will not regret it! They oysters here are AMAZING and fresh, along with their seafood dishes. I always have to get oysters here and it's great coming in big parties so you can try many things! My friends and I got the sampler platter of 24pc - I typically like the smaller oysters since they're sweeter and creamier but all 6 kinds were still top notch and the best you can get in Bay Area.We also ordered some hot items. The seafood stew was my all-time favorite. The tomatoes and garlic that infused with the clams, fish, octopus, etc. just made my tastebuds sing! The mussels were also delicious (and soaked with butter haha!) Get the fries on the side so you can dip it in the mussels sauce - YUMMMMM! The service is also wonderful, very friendly and communicative staff. I love coming here and I'll never not wait in line to have a seat in Hog Island!

Hog Island Oyster Co is a must visit when in San Francisco. I went here by myself yesterday to enjoy a late lunch. It was the perfect place! Although a bit on the pricey side, the food and atmosphere are definitely worth it.I was fortunate to be able to sit at the bar and watch the fresh oysters being prepared. It was so great! This place is constantly bustling, but they are able to accommodate a large amount of people with not too long of a wait.I ordered the grilled Worcestershire oysters and the corn salad. They also serve an ample slice of Acme Bread company bread with butter. I can say that the oysters were perfectly grilled and had just the right amount of seasoning. They were so fresh, too! The corn salad was also great. It was grilled corn, avocado, arugula and tomato tossed in a lime dressing and topped with Parmesan. The flavor was amazing! The bread was a great addition to the meal, as well.Overall, I highly recommend Hog Island Oyster Co. It is conveniently located in the Ferry Terminal Marketplace and offers fresh, well prepared oysters and seafood.

Delicious oysters and excellent service !! This place is absolutely perfect if you like oysters. First always be prepared for a line outside. We went on a weekday and had to wait 25-30 mins. We tried the 24 oyster combo where we tried two different kinds of oysters. They were fantastic and absolutely delicious. 11/10 We also got the grilled oysters and the sliders which were very good as well. I highly recommend the grilled oysters with Worcestershire sauce and the fresh oysters of the day. 11/10Paired this meal with a glass of white wine which was the perfect combination. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us a few complementary oysters when they found out we were celebrating a birthday ! I highly recommend this place for all !! Must visit when in SF :)

I was nervous first approaching Hog Island Oyster Co. due to the fact that there was a long line at 645 on a nice Sunday evening. Although, I was a visitor and this place was on the marina and had good reviews, the line moved quickly and we were seated within 18min. Food:Food was very good and loved the unlimited complimentary table bread.Oyster Poor Boy was 5* worthy. Oysters were crisp, flavorful, and piled on a nice bun topped with a slaw and remoulade sauce. Served with Old Bay seasoned fries.The grilled cheese was good, not great. With being in local bakery bread and cheese from local creamery I had higher expectations. It seemed to be lacking a little flavor, it was served with a small pickled salad which was also good, not great.Service:For the crowd of people dining it was top notch, drinks constantly refilled. Warm complimentary bread replenished immediately when the previous was devoured.Atmosphere:Cramped, communal dinning outside on the marina. Inside seemed snug as well. Very clean though, and noise was not too loud and made it easy to hear your company.

Ugh, I love Hog Island Oyster. The views are great, the oysters are fresh and delicious (both raw and the bourbon grilled oysters YUM), and the clam chowder is to die for. Service isn't the best but it's so packed all the time they are always running around and can't really pay attention to everyone. If you ever want great seafood and don't mind the wait/crowds then this is the place to go.

Say what you want, but one of the greatest joys in life is enjoying some beautiful, fresh oysters and a glass of rose on a beautiful San Francisco day. If you're of the same mind, stopping by Hog Island Oyster seems like a no-brainer.Granted, it is bound to be considered a tourist trap since it is right in the middle of the Ferry Building. Yes, it also appears in all of the guidebooks and the line fronting its entrance on the bay side will almost appear intimidating. Yet, I would make the argument it is well worth the wait. Even more, I pose the question, could you live with yourself if you didn't at least try it?The oysters are fresh and offer a pretty good variety that are sure to please your palate. If your data plan is running low and you have no idea what kind of oysters you like, just ask. The staff were pretty knowledgable and were quick to provide suggestions and background so you can decide with ease.Now, I come here for one thing: the chowder. It is pretty insanely good and large. It can be a meal in itself if you so desired and the lighter broth doesn't quite overwhelm the clams and the potatoes give you the filling starch you crave. It doesn't quite have that overwhelming sea flavor, but you know what you are enjoying as silence hits your table and all you hear is your party slurping away.I'm not saying the line is for everyone...but it is definitely something to try and say you had as part of your San Francisco experience.

Seafood lovers will not be disappointed!There is usually a line but the wait isn't too bad. They have outdoor seating and get an amazing view. Don't worry about being cold cause they have heaters. My friend and I shared the clam chowder, mussels, and a half dozen of mixed oysters. We were stuffed!Tell them you're sharing the chowder and they will split it into two superset bowls for you. I honestly thought we got two servings since even half was a lot. The clams were great and the soup was not as thick as other clam chowders I've had. I prefer it this way which allows more room for other food! A must get if you love clams and soup. I'm not usually a huge fan of mussels but these were delicious. The sauce was wonderful and I ended eating more bread than anticipated. The mussels were also really large so definitely worth. I don't actually know that much about oysters but the ones that I had were very fresh. I also don't think a play that has oysters in their name will serve bad oysters. The service was also great. I was catching up with friends and ended up staying till the end of the night and they didn't try to rush us out at all!

If you like Oyster, this is the place to go! no doubt at all!They don't have too many choices like other oyster bar, but every kind of their oyster is good!they are really famous for their original Tomales bay oyster, where they have their own oyster farm.If you like more sweet and small oyster, you gotta try their Kumamoto, Ichiban and Chelsea! The food beside oyster is just ok, we ordered seafood steamer with pasta, grilled shrimp and fries.The most important is to choose a good wine to pair with your oysters, they have a oyster wine from NAPA which is perfect for every kinda of oyster and seafood. (you can also drink while you are waiting in line)they also have many kinds of beer on tap and cocktails.Love this place!

Hog Island must have a cult following since its so busy at all times of the day. Perhaps it really is a tourist trap, but their food is quite honestly good. However it can be pricey. My party and I arrived at Hog Island to a 20 minutes wait in line. Theres a small area for people to wait at and they will seat you according to your party's availability. The restaurant itself isn't exactly huge, and probably can stand to have 50 more seats given the crazy popularity of Hog Island. There are seats inside and outside and during the day, its beautiful to look at the bay. I got the seafood stew which was absolutely delish. It had a healthy ratio of seafood to soup and was adequately flavored well. The other members of my party got their chowder which was equally delish. Service was fast and efficient. If the place is busy, you'll find yourself sharing a table with another party. Its not too awkward as they use the salt/pepper shaker and menus as an unspoken border.Overall Hog Island serves up great seafood with the correct atmosphere. Down sides are that there usually is a long wait time as well as premium pricing for food.

This is the place to go for fresh juicy oysters when at Ferry Market Building! The line does get long sometimes, so be sure to get there earlier than you plan. They have very good selections of fresh oysters for a good price! They staffs know their oysters really well and can recommend you exactly what you need. And I also love their Clam Chowder! Very generous with the clams unlike many other places. Creamy and flavorful broth made with bacon, potatoes and leeks. But what I like the most is their Grilled Cheese!! They use the cheese from Cowgirl Creamery and trust me, they are amazing! Just ooey-gooey cheesy toasts! And the toasts also pair really well with the clam chowder as well! :) Staff and atmosphere were really nice as well!

You see that line of people waiting to get their hands on some delicious oysters? Well get yourself in that line or you're missing out! Hog Island Oyster Co was one of my best meals during my visit to SF, and you won't be disappointed when you try them out either. Their oysters were all good - we had oysters with their wonderful mignonette that had me wanting to order more and more, grilled oysters (both Worcestershire & Chipotle bourbon - neither disappointing at all!!), and the mussels entree. My favorite was simply the oysters with the mignonette; they're a must-have, and I'm salivating just thinking of them (sorry for the tmi). I liked the grilled oysters, and I preferred the Worcestershire ones over the chipotle bourbon simply because the chipotle bourbons were sweeter, and the bourbon was a little bit too present for me. And I know everyone else is raving about the clam chowder, and trust me, we considered it, but we were so happy with our decision to get the mussels. Their sauce was incredible, and we didn't order very much so we ended up getting full on dipping the bread in the sauce, which blew my mind. Seriously everything was delicious, and you can't go wrong at this place. And the service, you ask? 5 stars, of course.

Yet another overdue review. We came here for lunch on a Friday, 06/31/17 to be exact. Hog Island is located inside the Ferry Building with amazing view of the Bay Bridge. My friends and I were very hungry after a delayed flight coming from San Diego. We were so lucky to be seated right away, I guess we beat the rush hour for lunch. They brought out complimentary ACME bread with butter.. we surely asked to refill our bread so we can dipped it in our clam chowder. My sister and I ordered half a dozen of Hog Island Sweetwater (pacific) oyster to share.. wow it was so delicious! All my friends ordered clam chowder.. and the clams were so fresh!! You can never go wrong with clams still in its shell. I also ordered Halibut Sliders.. which was okay, it lacked seasoning and flavor. I'll try a different kind of oyster instead. Parking can be horrible! Just uber or lyft. HahaService was excellent. They made sure everything was doing okay and if we need more refills with our drinks or bread. Great place to eat lunch with a view. And mouth watering oysters! I will be back Hog Island for more!!

I always stop by when I am in SF. I love the fresh seafood, the clam chowder and bay fries. We came in around 3PM, hoping to have beat the early dinner rush, we sort of did, we waited in line for about 30 minutes for 3 people. We didn't think it was bad, my friend grabbed us drinks at the bar and enjoyed our drinks while waiting in line. We were seated at the bar, which means service isn't too great.We ordered everything at once, because we knew it would be very difficult to see our server. We ordered our clam chowder, mussels, grilled cheese, po boy oyster sandwich, and a dozen oysters. We wanted to order the special butter garlic clams, but they had already ran out. Everything we ordered was delicious!

This restaurant was everything I expected it to be, and more! I can't rave about this place, enough. I was in San Francisco for work and a colleague recommended this place. I ordered many different items off the menu and all were spectacular. I tried many different oysters and a few of the notable ones were the Hamma ines which were tiny but very flavorful. Also the Capital WA were amazing and so were the Hog Island Sweetwater. I also enjoyed one of each of the grilled oysters and especially liked the Rockefeller! So delicious! The CA Yellowtail Crudo was divine. The thinly sliced pieces of crudo were perfection! This was probably my favorite item I ordered. Lastly, I also had the Citrus Salad since they were out of the Kale Caesar. This salad was really nice, light and fresh. All of these items tasted so great together, as well. You add in that gorgeous view of the water and incredible service (wish I remembered the guy's name, he was great) and you have yourself a 5 star restaurant! Can't wait to come back and I'll highly recommend to everyone.

Best Clam Chowder ever! This review is about a year late, but better late than never right?Literally the best clam chowder ever. It's not like your traditional or Boston-like clam chowder the broth is great with lots of clam flavor. A lot of clams in the bowl along with potatoes. Also got the grilled cheese to go along with the soup, which was also great. The star here is clearly he clam chowder though. Lines can be long, but we got there about 15 minutes before it opened and there was already a short line, but we made it in on the first wave.

Line here is always out the door. But I can understand why. Everything is incredible. Love the staff. Love the vibe. And most importantly, love the food.The oysters are incredibly fresh here. There is a great selection. Ask your server for recommendations. What really blew my mind here was the seafood stew. The broth was incredible and tasted wondrously of fresh seafood. There was a ton of seafood. I loved this. Probably one of the best seafood stew I've ever had. I also tried the oyster po boy and steamers with pasta. Both were very good. Sandwich was delicious, but when there are so many other options on the menu, I would pass on it in the future. The steamers was filled with a ton of clams. Broth was also delicious but not as yummy as the rustic seafood stew.Definitely come here to enjoy some delicious oysters and a nice scenic view of the Bay Bridge.

Skip the line and just sit at the bar if you don't want to wait in the long line - you can order food and drinks there (the wait for tables usually is a long line outside w/ more than an hour wait usually). Must try the chipotle bourbon grilled oysters- its a bit pricy but delicioussss, I kept wanting more! It had a bit of a sweetness to it from the brown sugar but the sauce was one of the best I am now craving. The raved about clam chowder was ok, it had a lot of mussels in it that was overpowering the soup itself for me. Overall, good place to try the oysters and sit outside to people watch by the waterside.

Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - 92/100My girlfriends took me on a city tour and we ended up at Embarcadero to see the beautiful Bay Bridge. The line was short at Hog Island Oyster Co. and we were instantly seated at the bar.We ordered a dozen Kumamoto oysters. Although teeny tiny, the oyster's petite meat is very sweet with minimal brininess. The lemony vinegary sauce on the side compliments the oysters well and doesn't overpower its original flavor. I usually enjoy eating my oysters with shrimp cocktail sauce, but there wasn't any boohoo. I don't eat spicy so I didn't use any of the complimentary hot sauce bottles at our table. I'm a little disappointed in the complimentary bread that everyone raves about. Butter didn't even help with the hard and dryness of the bread. Oh well...Overall, if it wasn't for our dinner plans that night, I literally would have ordered more food! We sat at the counter so we were able to see the chefs cook and push out fresh seafood like no other.

Having tasted many of the best clam chowders in both Boston and San Francisco - Hog Island Oyster Co is definitely at the top of the list. If you're looking for creamy clam chowder, this is probably not your cup of tea - but if you're feeling up to trying something new, this is the place to do it! Definitely a "soupy" type of clam chowder and the price is expensive, but they give you a lot!The key is to keep asking for bread to eat with the clam chowder :) They give you bread and butter to start your meal but since it doesn't come in a bread bowl, you can ask for bread to keep dipping it in the soup and it is simply heavenly~ I ordered a bowl of chowder and steamers with pasta since my friend and I were hungry. Wish I had ordered the mussels instead or something because by the end of the meal, I felt clammy (haha, bad joke). But seriously, this place does NOT skimp out on the clams - there must've been at least 30-40 clams between the two dishes which, in my opinion, justifies the prices per serving. The restaurant was very fast and efficient. I went there on a Thursday afternoon around 7 PM and we stood in line for about 15 minutes before being seated. We were a table of 2 and seated at the two edge seats of a table of 6 (so 1 table with 2 parties) but it was totally fine. I didn't feel like I was too close to anyone / uncomfortable that I was sharing a table with other people not in my party. Our waitress and all the other helper/staff members were very friendly and helpful. Food came out very quickly considering how busy it was. Will definitely be going back with parents (first time here was on a date ooh la la) and after eating you can walk around the pier or go to the Exploratorium, great way to spend the day. Thank you Hog Island Oyster Co! I'll be back for your clam chowder soon enough :)

I LOVE Hog Island!!!! I've been three times now and each time has been amazing. I went this past weekend with a friend around 4pm and there was already a line! But don't worry, the line moves pretty fast since they have a pretty big space and we were seated in around 20 mins. We ordered the Clam Chowder to split, the 12 Mixed Oysters, and the White Apricot Sangria! The Chowder was amazing as always! I tell people that it's a very watery chowder which may be off-putting to some people, but give it a chance! It's packed with flavor and has a little mountain of clams even after they split the bowl for us! There's bacon, potatoes, celery and carrots in the chowder as well. We used the bread they give us (another amazing plus of Hog Island, the bread is to die for), to mop up the rest of the chowder. The oysters were also perfect and fresh as usual! Since we got the 12 mix (they have a 6 and 24 as well, if I'm not mistaken), we got the try one of each on their menu! They gave us a little tour of each of the oysters and told us which one to finish with as well. There was lemon and their own sauce concoction (shallots, cilantro, etc.) to put on the oysters as well as cocktail sauce and horseradish if you ask for it. Each one was amazing and there was no sand and I couldn't ask for anything else. The White Apricot Sangria was so adorable as well! Served with a little dried apricot on a stick and a cute paper striped straw, it wasn't too strong and just on the side of sweet. It was perfectly paired with our oysters and was perfect for the sunny, but windy weather! I definitely want to take all my friends here (ahem Tiffany L.) when they visit the Bay!

Truth be told, I don't eat oysters. Actually I think of them as the vaginas of the ocean. (I'm completely sober while writing this review). But, my mom loves oysters and even though we had plans to eat at Gott's I'm always down to watch her take down a few oysters while I sip and savor the curated cocktails made at the bar in the back (the only place in the restaurant that you can seat yourself, so get ready to wait!) Also, acme bread. The best bread on the planet comes on the table as a small gesture for putting up with all the bullshit of getting a seat in this place.As a non-oyster eater I've enjoyed many meals here, the grilled cheese, all the salads and the clam chowder is not to be missed. But let's get back to the real reason why I never object to coming here... the cocktails. Today, I had a Watermelon Wake ($12) Hansen's organic cucumber vodka, watermelon and lime juice, bitters and Thai chili. Was the best cocktail I've ever had in my life. I've also been to their actually oyster farm in Tomales Bay and highly recommend that to anyone who visits Northern California and loves sea vaginas.

I come here quite often, but this is my first time checking in and reviewing the place. The service is usually quite spectacular. Although this time it was a little sluggish. Our waiter seemed to be a little lazy or just not in a rush to give us service. She was extremely friendly but just not on top of it as other servers have been from this location. She wasn't the worst service I've ever had, just slightly below average. I give the service a 4/5. As for the food, it is always fresh and of the highest quality! My brother and I ordered a 6 oyster plate of hog island oysters, and they were extremely fresh and massive. We also ordered the grilled cheese sand which, which is by far the best grilled cheese sand which I have ever had. I haven't had a lot of gourmet grilled cheese sand whiches but that is my favorite. Food is a 5/5 in my opinion! Overall I give this place a 4.5/5.

The clams were oh so yummy. The Seafood stew was fantastic. This dish was heavenly. The tomato broth was so flavorful. A great amount of seafood and they were awesome.

We were walking around and decided to stop by for a quick Saturday night dinner. They don't accept reservations and there was a line but it moved pretty quickly. We were seated within 5 minutes. And what a pleasant experience that was.I love the idea of the communal table. It's fun to sit next to people from all over, all enjoying their oysters on a beautiful summer night. We went with steamed mussels and grilled squid salad, accompanied by some delicious sauvignon blanc. I was in heaven - the food was fresh and delicious, sitting outside by the water couldn't feel better, and the service was very pleasant and efficient.

When guests fly in from out of town, you get to go and do many tourist attractions. It's great because you get to discover new places and create new adventures together. This trip back to the Bay Area, I had several unexpected guests fly in. It made the trip very memorable and lots of fun. During our day in the city, I took them to Hog island Oyster Co. They are easy to find in the Ferry Building off Embarcadero and it's a must do when you're in the city visiting. We arrived off hours and luckily had no wait which was perfect. This place doesn't have Happy Hour so try to go when there isn't a long line because this place gets very busy. We chose to sit at the counter but we should have sat on a table. Water was dripping on me from the ceiling while we dined. There was a leak from a pipe or from the ceiling. I asked for napkins but our server forgot and didn't bring me any. Service here was average, nothing spectacular. We could also see the staff since we sat at the counter and they were goofing around which wasn't very professional. This didn't deter us from doing what we came here to do which was eating some legit oysters. We ordered the Oyster Bar Mix which is a selection from all the fresh oysters they had on their menu, Littleneck Clams and the Citron Grilled Oysters. I downed it all with a Bloody Mary. It wasn't that great and the paper straw it came with made it very difficult to drink. Not something I would recommend or order again. It was great they had a variety of fresh oysters you can choose from. Every type was so good! The Citron Grilled Oysters were legit, just wish they were healthier so I could eat more lol.

This place hands down has the best oysters. We ordered 2 plates of the grilled oysters (Worcestershire and a brown sugar chipotle) with 2 clam chowders. The oysters were grilled perfectly, fresh, lots of juice and full of flavor. The clam chowder was just as good and full of clams.

Me and my boyfriend had such a great experience here last month for our vacation. We love seafood and we heard their Oyster's were awesome so we had to try it! The line is a hit or miss and I'm glad we went early before 11am and got great seats of the view of the harbor and a great server as well! (Wish I recalled what his name was!) We ordered one of each of the grilled oysters and each of them were very flavorful and tasty esp the sauce that comes with it. Very freshly served! I recommend to get there early and explore the ferry landing. Such great place to take pictures as well. It's also great to try some dessert places before or after eating here. If you love sea food! DEF a food place you must try! Highly recommend!

If you're somewhat pressed for time, this might be your ideal choice. Long lines tend to wrap outside the building. Luckily my dining partner and I found two spots at bar. Same menus too! We ordered the stone fruit salad with arugula and candied walnuts and added shrimp. We also started with half dozen oysters which were perfectly sized, just Enough brine with a hint of sweetness. The salad was lovely in terms of presentation but it definitely lacked in the greens department. Despite the few greens, the stone fruit and candied walnuts paired well together and with the shrimp. Now, the shrimp to our surprise was served as a side. Which was a little lackluster in terms of presentation. But mostly importantly it wasn't deveined. I'm pretty sure no one wants to have to devein their shrimp before eating them... unless your in Europe or ZoeThing. Aside from that the meal was satisfactory. Our server was really accommodating with our order and had us out the door so we could make it back to the office on time.

We tried several different oysters here that were pricey, but they were really fresh! This is as fresh as it gets, which is what I expected considering the restaurant is dockside. I loved their clear sauce and wish I knew what was in it. We sat right at the oyster bar where we could see two chefs de-shell and prep the plates in front of us. This is important to me because I did get food poisoned once (different restaurant) and I think it's because the oysters sat out for too long before it was served to me. I didn't have that problem here. It does get crowded sitting inside but there's also outdoor seating with an ocean view. Would love to revisit.

I came here today for Father's Day lunch. The place opens up at 11, we got there at 10:45am and there was already a line. The group right in front of us wanted to sit inside but just missed the last inside table so had to wait or sit outside. We brought my dog so had to sit outside, by 11:15am we were seated. We ordered the grilled cheese, seasonal salad, mussels w fries, clams w pasta, seafood stew, bourbon oysters, clam chowder & the yellow tail appetizer. The food was PLENTY for a group of 4 - we were stuffed. I've heard great things of this place, as you can see from the reviews, and it was pretty good but not as much as the hype sounded. The clam chowder came out on the cold side, we told the waiter and he kindly brought us back another bowl which was piping hot. The presentation was great, the Clams were topped onto of soup. This isn't your typical clam chowder, t was thin and had bacon in it. I liked it, but def wasn't a traditional clam chowder. My family loved the bourbon grilled oysters, mussels & seafood stew (I didn't eat them). The grilled cheese was good too - they use the cheese from Cowgirl creamery which is my fave! The complimentary bread is pretty good as well. Overall it was a delicious meal, I'd recommend coming by if you were visiting from out of town and by the area.

Wow. I have passed this place for years and it's always seemed like an elitist, overpriced sham. I was woefully wrong! We ordered tons of food and everything was a homerun. Oysters? Perfectly brainy, bright and delicious. Squid salad was incredibly smoky and perfect the tender instead of chewy. The baby back ribs also had excellent char with a bright sauce on them. Muscles, fish stew, melon salad, fried and chill bees, fries - - everything was positively excellent!Of course, it wasn't cheap but compared to similar restaurants, about average. We ate like crazy and it ended up being about $70 per person. Expensive but not outrageous considering the quality, the scenery and the freshness. This will be my new place for fresh, delicious seafood!

The BEST clam chowder I've ever had! It's creamy and rich but light at the same time. They are incredibly generous with the amount clams they put in the chowder as well. There are potatoes and some meat in the broth too. The dish is pretty filling with the potatoes and adding bread to soak up all of the creamy chowder just makes it a million times yummier. With it being only $14 it's totally worth it. I would pass on the fried brandade ($14). For that price you get 5 croquettes that are about 2 inches in diameter. The fish was stringy and dry on the inside. They give you a dipping aioli but it still felt like the dish was missing something. The breadcrumb shell was crispy so that was good. I will always be back for the clam chowder!

This is by far my boyfriends favorite oyster place in San Francisco. I have never had oysters before but they were very good, fresh, and had lots of fresh ingredients provided.Another major plus to this restaurant is the amazing view and plethora of outdoor seating. We had the pleasure of visiting with another couple that was sat next to us. My advice for this restaurant is not to go in large groups unless reserving a table. It's very crowded, loud and pricey. It also is not the best for intimate conversations if you are trying to be secluded with your partner somewhere for a romantic dinner.

Popped in for lunch here on my last day in San Francisco. We were lucky to snag a couple seats at the bar and avoid the line that forms outside the restaurant. We shared half a dozen oysters to start that were fresh and sweet. I ordered the stone fruit salad with candied walnuts and greens. I was surprised at how few greens there were but the fruit in the salad was great. I asked for no cheese and they were happy to accommodate. We also ordered a side of the shrimp that come head on and unfortunately are they were not deveined. They were also astronomically expensive for their small size. They were decent, but not worth the work (we deveined ourselves) or the price. A nice place for lunch that offers a view of the bridge and some great exploring before and after.

We came here based on recommendations and after reading reviews. There was a line but it wasn't too terrible. There was a slight confusion in regards to seating because it was our big party and another. Not a big deal, but the staff here went above and beyond to fix the situation. Our party of 7 ordered a simple salad, halibut, grilled cheese, clam chowder and 4 dozen mixed oysters. The clam chowder was amazing! Perfectly balanced and not too salty. The clams tasted very fresh, I would have preferred bigger slices of bacon, but no big deal! We got the grilled cheese for my son which he said was ok. I'm thinking it was the mix of all the different cheeses that he wasn't used to, but I liked it. The oysters! Super fresh, clean taste. We ordered the mix which included a variety of different local oysters. I can't remember which was what but some were sweet and one was a little salty. I wish they would of provided crackers but again, not a big dealThis place definitely lived up to the hype! Every time I come to SF I will for sure be making a stop here!

A restaurant that specializes in oysters and is located right at the pier? Count me in!!I was pretty impressed by Hog Island. Location is very nice (albeit a bit hard to find; you have to go in the building and make a left once you're on the other side outside) and service was nice. Because it's at one of the most popular tourist attractions of SF, you're gonna have a tough time finding close parking. Now let's talk about the real deal..Oysters themselves were oh so sweet and succulent. They have a plethora of different kinds to choose from and each one has a subtle difference but juuuuust distinct enough to taste the uniqueness. But the one I remember the most was the grilled burboun oysters. Mmmmmmmohmygod. Melted in my mouth (see picture attached)I ordered some fries to eat with the oysters but they came after we had finished the oysters... Wish they had brought them all out together since I like eating them with each other but oh well. Fries were good though.I also got their clam chowder item. Now, we all know clam chowder as being chunky but theirs was straight up SOUP. Now, you may like that but I personally thought it was weird. I like my chunky clam chowder. It's mixed with a bunch of clams/mollusks which are fresh but still... I guess I'm just weird like that lol

Came here on a Sunday around 1pm, and there was a long line outside. The line moved quickly though, and we were seated at a long share table outdoors.After being seated, it took awhile for the waiter to take our orders. We had some oysters, beef short rib, and the clam chowder (split into two bowls). The oysters were delicious, though you can never really go wrong with oysters. The short rib however, was dry and mediocre. My boyfriend enjoyed the clam chowder a lot. I thought the chowder was tasty, but wasn't as thick as I would have liked. It had an ample amount of clams and small pieces of bacon, and was served with bread. The ambience at Hog Island is nice to sit outdoors on a sunny day, but it doesn't take reservations and appears to be busy often. Service was average. Based on the food, I probably wouldn't come back.

Been here enough times to know that Hog Island Oyster Co. is definitely a place to bring my family and friends to. Whether it's for a birthday or just a girls night out; this place hits the spot. PARKING:Forget about it. If you come here at night, you can probably snag a spot on the street (metered)but other than that, I suggest taking BART and getting off Embarcadero. I parked 2 blocks away and meters were at $6/hr. RESERVATIONS ? HOW LONG IS THE WAIT? They don't take reservations and if you don't care where you sit, it won't take too long to grab a table but still, you're gonna have to wait in line either way. I suggest taking a look at the menu and knowing what you want prior so you can place your order in ASAP. They do provide bread (ACME) with some yummy butter once you get sat. SERVICE:Consistently good service. Friendly servers and hosts are always nice and accommodating. FOOD:MUST HAVES: chowder, grilled cheese and fried oysters. Chowder: delicious and creamy. Dip your table bread in it and you won't regret it. Grilled Cheese: comes with pickled veggies. Big pieces, definitely enough to share. What diet ?? Fried Oysters: $3 a pop. Coated in cornmeal batter, you're gonna want to order 3 minimum. Get these as an appetizer. The menu isn't extensive but that's okay because anything you get here will not disappoint your taste buds. OTHER INFO:-No bathroom within the restaurant. There are 2 located on opposite ends of the ferry building-For the chowder, they cannot take out the bacon since the bacon is marinated with the veggies.

This is the spot I always take my non-SF friends who really want the full tourist experience! It offers a nice view of the pier and the freshest seafood you'll find in the city. Prices are a little more on the higher end (still affordable!), but you really get what you pay for. First of all, they don't take reservations. Everyone has to line up outside (no paper waiting list either) and wait to be seated. However, they do have a bar inside where you can purchase drinks and take it with you to the line outside to kill time. The wait is generally 30min - 1hour, not too bad once you get a couple of drinks in haha. I'm not really a fan of raw oysters, but my friends really enjoy them. They have a wide selection of them from different parts of the country. The Oyster Bar Mix is a good choice if you want to try one of everything. I really like the grilled cheese sandwich which comes in 4 pieces. It's a good idea to share this since it can get really filling! I also really like the steam mussels (add the fries for $3). The clam chowder is more on the watery side (none of that Boudin stuff) but still very flavorful. The servers are always very friendly and attentive. PS: don't get full off the complimentary yummy bread and butter!

I moved to San Francisco in 2013 and Hog Island Oyster was one of the first meals I had in the city. I returned last weekend and it was just as good as I remembered. I grabbed some Blue Bottle and lined up outside right before they opened at 11 PM. The line was long but it moved quickly. I sat at the bar and the staff was super friendly and attentive. The complimentary bread and butter is delicious. I ordered the Old Bay Fries and the Clam Chowder which is my favorite. The open kitchen is fun to watch and the view of the Bay Bridge can't be beat.

Hog Island has become a regular stop for my trips to San Francisco. The location in the Ferry Building is beautiful and lends itself to a really wonderful, unique experience. One thing I really like about Hog Island is that a lot of their ingredients are locally sourced and many are sourced from other vendors in the Ferry Building. For example, their bread is from Acme Bread Company and the cheese and butter is from Cowgirl Creamery. They also farm their own oysters nearby. My go to order is the clam chowder with potentially oysters and/or grilled cheese. The broth is much thinner than normal clam chowder, but it is still rich and full of flavor. The flavors are incredibly dynamic and there is a generous amount of clams throughout. It's different, but in a good way, so definitely be open to it. My only complaint is that I do often feel like there are so many potatoes that they overpower everything else sometimes. The selection of oysters is also a huge plus and I enjoy both the sweet water and the cooked oysters. I brought my vegetarian friend and she also loved the grilled cheese, so that option is always open.TIP Put butter on the bread and dip it in the clam chowder (or oyster stew). It is AMAZING and a huge reason I go here. It is an incredible combination. The Oyster Stew isn't on the menu anymore, but they will still make it for you if you ask!

So glad I was able to make it on my last quick SF trip! Came here on a Saturday night and made it right before they cut off the line! Only waited for about 10 minutes and got seated on the patio. The seat were a bit crowded but the view was breathtaking! We ordered the Chelsea Gems oyster, Oyster Po Boy and Clam Chowder. Boy, those were some of the freshest oysters I've never had! Chelsea Gems are small oysters packed with juicy flavors. The Oyster Po Boy was beyond tasty considering I normally don't like fried oysters and the Clam Chowder was filled with more than enough clams!I wanted to order more oysters but because we got there so late, I didn't want to be one of those customers who order last minute! Kind of wish I did though. I would recommend anyone to come here if you ever stop visit the city. I can't wait until my next trip because I already crave their oysters!

Get it: A dozen bar mix oysters ($38), chowder ($14) and grilled cheese ($13).Came here with the beau for dinner on a week day. I'm sure the wait is longer during the weekends but it's worth the wait! We were only staying in SF for a few days and heard so much about Hog Island Oyster so we strolled along here one evening about an hour before closing time. There was already a line so we were going to turn back to go elsewhere but I saw people dining outside literally digging their faces in to the plates, which convinced me to stay. We enjoyed the sunset while on line and was ready to order by the time we were seated in the middle of the restaurant nearby the area where the magic happens. I watched the guys shucking oysters right in front of me like it was no one's business. The view of the Bay Bridge was also amazing when it got dark outside and it lit up.The dozen bar mix oysters ($38), chowder ($14) and grilled cheese ($13) were perfect to split between the two of us. The server even brought out the chowder divided into two bowls for us to share. In the end, the bowls and plates were licked off clean and I'm pretty sure our server was impressed when he came to collect them off the table. This place is a must for seafood lovers. If you're not a fan of seafood, nooo problem. There's a lot of non-seafood options for you to choose from the menu like.. the grilled cheese. Oh my goodness.. It was heavenly when eaten with their pickled sides combined with a spoonful of their chowder. As for their oysters, I don't think I need to say much. Besides how amazing and fresh they taste, you also know that they're aphrodisiacs so you knowwww you and your partner are guaranteed to go home quite.. Happy :)Will I be back? Of course. The only downside to this place is the wait but it wasn't thattt horrible. I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in SF to try some of their other dishes. I'll probably order the same stuff again but will wear stretchier pants so I can maximize my seafood intake and order other things on top of it as well.

I come to California a few times a year for work/family, and any time I can visit this Hog Island Oyster Co., I do.Located in the Ferry Building, Hog Island has beautiful views of the Bay Bridge. If you can hit it at sunset, Hog Island is a great place to sit outside, enjoy the scenic sunset and watch the light show on the bridge. I've never actually sat inside, because I just find the outside patio so lovely. On weekdays, I've never had issues getting my desired table, but than again, I come later in the evening to avoid the standard dinner rush. Oh, and FYI, no reservations here.Love the fresh oysters and the nice cocktail selection. On my most recent visit, my friend and I split the Squid Salad and the Seafood Stew. We loved the Seafood Stew- the broth was so delicious, we could've just drank it. I wouldn't order the Squid Salad again. Not much flavor to it, and you can really only eat so much plain grilled Squid before you start feeling queezy. Luckily, we had a nice bevy of oysters to offset it! The oysters were huge, came out quickly, and are more delicious every time. Hog Island has my San Francisco heart!

Good service, very pricey but understandable considering the freshness of the seafood. The Gumbo will be a hit or miss!!!! This dish was unique in the sense of all the mixture! I was not a fan due to the taste and seasoning. However, by the taste of it, you can definitely tell that the ingredients were fresh. Just wasn't good enough for my preferences. The dish definitely on the southern food style. So expect it to be on the saltier side with variety of meats. Oysters were fresh!!! Worth the splurge.

Oyster lovers must try this place by the ferry! They have a huge queue outside their front doors. The whole line and probably the majority of the restaurant was filled with tourists. Since I was just with my husband, we got inside in Less than 10 minutes because they use the bar when there are long waits. The bar was fun to sit at because you can watch people chucking oysters. The clam chowder was on point. It's not as creamy as I thought and was more of a broth base. Try the oyster combo so you can get different kinds of oysters. It's pricey but the oysters of so fresh!

If you're reading this, it's likely that I've already told you that I love you deeply.Now that I got my personal feelings out of the way - I'll get to the main points as it appears there are over 4,000 reviews for this place. From what I was able to observe, arriving early is as crucial as chewing your food. The line starts about 45 mins to an hour PRIOR to opening. Is this Black Friday? Jordan XXVI release? Vacation giveaway? No, it's Hog Island Oyster Co., folks. That being said.. with an early arrival, you can choose to sit either inside or out. Complimentary bread and (now that we've exited the California drought) water is served. Naturally, being in San Francisco and all, my girlfriend and I ordered 2 clam chowders to start us off on the right foot. If you're familiar with the 'restaurant serves bread' concept, a bread bowl is not necessary to order with your clam chowder.. unless, of course, that's your thang baby girl. The clam chowder was creamy and buttery with hints of pepper, lightly chewy clams that were delightful and miniature chunks of what I plan on eating on my death bed, bacon. Overall, it was one of the BETTER clam chowders I've had in SF - maybe top 3?Onto the oysters. Oysters have and always will be a mixed bag for me. We ordered - Hog Island Sweetwater (Pacific) Raw which were mouth wateringly scrumptious! They were rinsed and chucked to accordingly, meaning, it didn't necessarily taste like I jumped in the ocean and served myself oysters. They were a mixture of refreshing, tantalizingly sweet and packed a light kick with some Tabasco. Overall, if raw oysters could be rated out of 5.. the HI Sweetwater Oysters are a 5.What I've never had, and would go back here or anywhere else that serves these.. are the GRILLED OYSTERS. The Chipotle Bourbon Oysters were grilled to perfection and are easily the best tasting Bivalvia I've eaten during my short lifespan on this planet we call Earth. There's something about that flame grilled taste that you can't get anywhere other than.. a grill, of course. The bourbon and brown sugar provide a sweet yet luscious twist while the chipotle throws you a slight heated curve which I thoroughly enjoyed. These were more than a 5/5, for sure. They're served in 4's. That means more than one order of these bad boy's will be absolutely necessary. The service here, despite HEAVY crowds, was on point, attentive and gracious. We were checked on frequently while our cups of water always maintained their fullness and our bread plates were never bare. Hog Island Oyster Co. showcases the Northern Pacific Seafood scene with flying colors and I'd HIGHLY recommend those grilled oysters to those that remain hesitant towards clams, shells and seafood all around.

I've been to both locations, their Ferry Building restaurant and out at the ocean for some real time shucking. Nothing better on a beautiful day.

Love this place! From the food to drinks to scenery! My boyfriend and I came in the evening and sat outside on the patio, where you could see the bridge light up in a distance and water surrounding it.. Sighhh it was so romantic.. Loved it... We came on a weekday and the wait was only about 5mins for outdoor seating. We didn't mind at all. It was more chill and quiet outside anyways. Inside was very busy and chatty. The oysters were aahhmaaazzingg!! Soo fresh and juicy and sweet! Oh man I could eat them for days! Also, the clam chowder was sooo good!!! Real shelled clams in a hearty broth on a chilly night with my baby was magical! Haha Use the bread that they give you at the beginning to dip in the clam chowder you won't be sorry! Yumm...I def recommend this place if you're ever in town! Have a seat outside on the patio for a more intimate time and wonderful scenery.

One of the best seafood meals I've ever had. Unfortunately, there was a long line for Saturday afternoon, (prob should have waited well over an hour) but our party of three got seated in no time! -- We knew we wanted to try the oysters but didn't know how to order them so we got the mixed plate and each one was fresh and perfect... and I need to emphasize that the vinegar sauce for the oysters was absolutely ahhh-mazing! I dipped my bread in the leftovers, it was THAT good! We also ordered the chorizo mussels, clam chowder and seafood stew, all perfection! I highly recommend this restaurant and the best part was sitting outside with the beautiful view of the bridge in the background.

VEGETARIAN REVIEW --Came here with my seafood loving friend since it's a great place to show visitors the Ferry building and sit near the water. There is quite the wait...we probably waited 30-40min for a group of 8 for dinner Sunday at 5pm. If you are a smaller party less than 4, wait is significantly shorter. But come before you are hungry! But the food came out quickly.There are 3 veg options: two salads (one is more of a side salad) and the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese uses all local cheese and bread which is cool but I was craving something healthy and light and went with the corn salad which was really tasty! I also shared some YUMMY old bay fries with friends. The drinks were amazing. All of the alcohols looked hand picked, orgranic, curated, whatever buzzword you want! I got the watermelon wave (watermelon, cucumber vodka, and thai chili).

Still fantastic but the bread on the weekends shows it's age. Kudos for the non alcoholic shrub and ginger beer non-alchoholic cocktails. The shrimp are to be missed, I mean stay the program shuck it or pass.

Best oysters I've ever had in my life. Was there on a weekday. There were 2 of us and we only waited for about 15 minutes. Awesome service and awesome food! This place has no become a must-visit restaurant when in SF to us.

After an awesome afternoon touring Alcatraz (note: it's a long walk, but totally doable! It's worth it, promise), we decided to head over to Hog Island for happy hour. But to our disappointment, they no longer offered it. But nevertheless, it didn't damper our evening and was determined to get our oyster fix. Lucky for us, we were seated next to the kitchen so we got to see all the food coming out! Every dish that came out looked delicious.Food:6 Oysters $18 5/5We were able to choose half Hog Island (CA) and half Henderson (WA). Between the two, we definitely enjoyed the Hog Island oysters more as they were meatier and plump.Grilled Oysters $14 5/5An order comes with 4 grilled oysters. Available today, we chose the Chipotle flavored. It was slightly smokey and buttery good! Make sure you save some bread for sopping. Just wish there were more! Little Neck Clams $2 each 5/5If you never had clams on the half shell, this is the place to try as it was so fresh and delicious! Not sure if this makes sense, but it was very clean tasting. Chowder $14 4/5They only offer this in a bowl, which is great for sharing. The soup wasn't as thick as I would have liked, but the flavor and creaminess was great. Definitely loved the presentation as they included a generous amount of clams in the shell. Remember to save some bread for this! Although a bit expensive, the seafood was super fresh and we all very much enjoyed it. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!

I got a lot of recommendations for places to eat in SF, but only one single place was recommended to me by multiple friends who all have different tastes in food: Hog Island Oyster Company. "Go to the Ferry Building", they told me, "and eat oysters and be happy."Despite the hype? Despite the lines? Despite the tourists?Yes. Go.So I went. And I want to give a shout-out to the hostess who seated me at the bar and then kept the seat next to me open for over an hour because I had no idea when my boyfriend would be released from work and able to join me. While I waited, I ordered the clam chowder, which several of my friends recommended in addition to the namesake oysters. It came out REALLY fast, because they are just constantly cooking this chowder as I could see sitting in front of that particular part of the kitchen.It was also the best clam chowder I've ever had. The flavors were phenomenal, and I actually quite liked that it wasn't thick like New England-style chowder tends to be. It was a great stew, awesome for dipping my bread in, and I just... man, how am I supposed to eat clam chowder anywhere else now???The oysters were also really yummy. They didn't have quite the same impact on me as the chowder (I was also less hangry by the time I was slurping them down), but they were delicious. If you have your heart set on specific oysters, you'll want to check because they do offer different oysters every day depending on what they have and what's fresh. While I ate, I watched the cooks grill a bunch of oysters in front of me, and the dungeness crab was very popular as it was the end of the season. Everything looked and smelled really delicious and everybody looked really happy with their meals. The prices are on the steeper side but with this level of hype, you have to expect that.TL;DR+ Delicious clam chowder, $14 price tag+ Great oysters+ Expect lines but not a crowd (hence lines)
