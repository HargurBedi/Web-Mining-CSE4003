After you've fulfilled your seafood cravings in San Francisco, the next thing is to venture out and try other foods! Well, thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, I searched some places and found that Carmel Pizza had a super high rating. My initial thought was to skip this joint and go for more seafood, but decide to give it a try.....and boy was it worth it!! What a lovely little relaxing place in the middle of Fishermans Wharf!! On Jones st near the pier, there are several food trucks that really are a must. This one is one of them. When you enter, you really feel like your in a little happy village away from the hustle and bustle. Ordering is a breeze and in no time, pizza is served to you at your table or you can take it out in a box- whichever you prefer! Although I thought that I have had my fair share of pizza and this one would be A-ok....I was wrong. Let's just say that I have never ate a whole pizza in my life....until I ate the pizza here. First off, the crust is crazy super thin so you eat more toppings than crust. The toppings are so fresh it really provides so many remarkable flavors that you forget where you are and you seriously sink into pizza oblivion. If we were staying in SF longer, we would for sure return to this amazing place. Thanks Carmel pizza for the once in a lifetime experience!!!

This place oozes with San Francisco charm. Think lots of cute permanent food truck type places lined up by Fisherman's Wharf. They have a heated seating area that's really cute.I can understand why they're on the list of best pizza places in San Fran. The crust was amazingly good and I polished off almost an entire pizza. Definitely pricey but delicious.

This is an absolutely nice pizza place around Fisherman's Wharf. You order and pay first and the ambiance is just delightful.It's like an upgraded food cart with a thoughtfully designed and decorated patio that is cozy and welcoming. Pizzas are about $12-15 and one serves one hungry customer or two if they are not as hungry.Take your time to enjoy the details in the decorations and of course, enjoy your pizza. The Bianca is perfect. Win-win.

We came here right after the airport and we were starving.The place is very nice and service is good.We order Quattro fromagio pizza (pictured). It's wood fired oven so it has a good taste. I wish they put more cheese because I didn't feel like it was a real four cheese pizza.They also have some drinks like coke, water, etc.

So its a shame but this place would have gotten five stars based on its food!!! However lost four stars due to costumer service, they were very rude, my daughter who has dairy and gluten allergies could not eat what we were eating and grabbed a couple of tacos from the food truck beside this one. Except they refused to allow her to sit and eat with us. There was no other customers in the Resturant at all, we were the only ones! This is a shame, when I told the young man of my situation he did not even care, just stood by his rude disposition and this just made me madder! Will never return due to this!!

Fresh, wood fired, Neapolitan pizza. My wife and I were strolling around Fishermans's Wharf looking for a lunch spot and we came across Carmel Pizza Company. The entire place is outdoors except for the food prep area which is sort of like a trailer I guess but you can clearly see the wood fired oven while ordering. Wanting something light we opted for the Margherita but I threw a twist in and got anchovies on my half. These things were so fresh they were still swimming. I figured being just outside of Fisherman's Wharf...why not. The pizza was excellent and we couldn't have been happier we chose Carmel Pizza Company.

Margherita Pizza was quite good.Why the two stars? Poor customer service and a bad attitude. I called ahead of time and the guy on the phone was curt and very impatient. He was mumbling, not listening, and seemed completely disinterested in taking my order. Secondly, there was an akward attitude by the cashier while I picked up the pizza.

First I should start by saying I'm not a huge fan of most pizza. They seem to always over compensate by having too much of something or everything. We stopped here while exploring a new portion of the city and figured we would take a chance. We chose the simple Margarita pizza and i ate half of it, eagerly! I could eat this more frequently than I would ever own up to. Staff was kind and cheerful, the 'oasis' sitting area is comfy and cozy, and the entire experience was exceptional. Bravo and thank you, Carmel Pizza Co!!!

We ordered a white pie and a marghretti. I was a little disturbed at first cause the white pie had been burnt but thats what you get from a brick oven. First time I also had garlic in every bite. Next time I will ask being allergic to alot of things. The service was good and if there's no room they do accommadate. Soda's were alittle pricey. I had a water on me being it was hot day. An it was not frowned upon so thats was excellent as well.

The pizza was amazing. More of a flatbread almost with the super thin crust. They advertise it as a New York style and it definitely delivered, with a California flair. We had the Quattro Formagio with added sausage and it was just big enough for two without getting over full. A bit greasy with all the chess but not overly so. It is sort of a hole in the wall off the main touristy area of fishermans wharf but I definitely would go back next time I head down that way.

This is a hidden, quaint permanent food truck. Not a lot of seating so I imagine it could get pretty crowded at lunch time. The staff was nice enough. They welcomed us in just to sit if we needed to. (We'd planned on eating here anyway.)The pizza was quite tasty (Bianca + sauce + mushrooms). Not too much sauce and cooked just until toasty. I love thin crust pizza. Wish there was oregano/garlic/etc. for the table. House-shaved parmesan for a dollar. For some, the portions for pizza and salad may be a tad small but I think it's just enough not to overeat.

Here's why the one star review: I walk up and ask for a pepperoni pizza. They tell me it will be $17 and change. No idea how big or small the pizza is. But in this tourist trap area (fisherman's wharf) the price doesn't surprise me. Fine. I then ask for a cup of water. They proceed to tell me that I can purchase a bottle of water. I ask "So, you can't give me a cup of tap water?" Their response was "We don't have cups."Really? Well then get cups. Forcing people to purchase bottled water is BS. Especially when I'm paying $17+ for a pizza. Stop gouging the customers. No tap water in a food service establishment? Not to mention SF has some of the best tap water around. Doesn't matter how good the pizza is, I won't be back.P.S. No restrooms either.

This place is so cute! At first the heated temp was too warm for me, but it got cooler after I sat down. It's a mini garden! Kind of relaxing. They sell beer and wine, along with flavored Pellegrino, Honest Tea, etc. from their self serve fridge. Yelp check in provides $1 off a pizza =) Two 6 slice 10-12" pizzas weren't enough for seven people so we ordered a third:Capriccosia: applewood smoked ham, artichokes, olives, and mushrooms with mozzarella, not bad ($18)Margherita: mozzarella & basil, simple ($13)Crudo e Parma: my favorite! Each delicious bite of that non fatty, less salty prosciutto left me craving more. Arugula baked in the mozzarella! The shaved Parmesan was the cherry on top. I could've eaten this all by myself. ($18)They have this special chili oil imported from Italy; supposedly packs a punch, but it merely added more flavor to the Margherita. Folks should definitely try it. I can't handle spicy but I liked it! Mopping it up with my last bits of pizza over here ...Pizzas were thin crust (bonus points!), resulting in quick baking. My only complaint was the burned patches around the crust. I guess it adds to the charm but with frequent reminders to avoid charred edibles from entering my temple, it kind of turns me off. Workers were nice, informative. I'd go back for the crudo e parma and end with dessert next door from Baked Bear.

Walking around Fishermans Warf and we decided we wanted pizza. Knowing how great the Italian food is in San Francisco I wanted something good. So we found this placements n YELP and it was only a two block walk so we decided to try it. Glad we did. The Pizza was very good. I like the Margarita. Wood fired, great flavor and a crispy crust. We ordered two pizzas with 2 cokes and a beer. For my kids and me. Might have given them 5 stars but on a $50 bill they wouldn't break a $100 which was all I had. Shocked since they give a discount if you pay cash and it was lunch time. Honestly think the girls at the counter just didn't want to make change. All around good experience and we enjoyed the food.

Overpriced even for the area, when you look at what you get. Crust is decent but toppings are minimal. As in literally nothing for a $19 mid-sized pizza. The bottom and edges of my pie was severely burnt. Char-coaled black, and that's all I could taste. I mentioned it to server who acknowledged it but didn't bother to offer an apology or compensation.

Good portion size too. Perfect for just one person, or if you get two different kinds, you can share (or not!)Cute and cozy vibe. They have outside heater lamps too.In the fisherman's wharf area so a lot of tourists, but this is your best bang for your buck if your craving pizza.My man friend raved about this place too and he comes here all the time, that they gave him a stamp card!

I came here and ordered 1 pizza on July 4th at about 8.30pm. I knew there would be a bit of a wait because it was busy. I waited 30 min and started to notice other people who ordered after me receiving pizza, so I asked how much further until mine would be ready, and was told they hadn't made it yet. I asked for a refund, it was given however I was also short changed.Being busy isn't an excuse for poor service. I don't recommend this place. Go up the road a little further.

The VegeGregian Review:Very popular for the hip families ;) Located on a strip of what seems to be a permanent food truck park very close to the wharf. Cute outdoor seating area with a limited number of tables but people seem to come and go pretty fast. Order at the window of the food truck and they are super speedy with your food!! I feel like we only waited maybe 5 minutes for our food. Definitely check out the fridges to the left of the window where you order for tasty bottled drinks (not just your typical sodas either, they have some healthy fruit juices). PIZZA TIME!Romantica ($17): Mozzarella fior di latte, arugula, Heirloom tomato, Balsamic glaze, Parmigiano reggiano.Delicious thin crust, fresh toppings, slightly charred but not burnt, moderately generous with the toppings, and decent sized pizza for the price. Came here with my mom and dad (3 people). We shared 2 pizzas and it was just perfect for us. Tip: Check in on Yelp and you get $1 off any pizza!

I'm not big on bread. I've been known to eat the inside of a sandwich and leave the bread behind. On big doughy slices of pizza, I'll eat the toppings and leave the entire crust behind. But I do have a weak spot for thin crust pizza. Especially a soft crust with a nice chew. I'll eat an entire slice of that. Crust and all! Carmel pizza company has the type of pizza I'm looking for. On Saturday, September 12th around 1:45pm, Rodney H and I stopped by for lunch.We shared the Diavola ($17): mozzarella, arugula, asiago, pepperoncini picante, salame piccante. Let's start with the crust. Thin, but not cracker thin, so you still feel like you're eating something substantial. The crust held up the toppings well. Spicy, melty with a nice freshness from the arugula. And I loved the chewy crust. Wash it down with nice cold beer and you have a great pairing. I opted for Anchor steam beer.CPC is outdoors, but it's actually enclosed pretty well. On a chilly day, you don't feel the wind or cold much. They've done a nice job with the space.Great pizza in a fun casual atmosphere. Who knew this existed in a touristy area?! I think I now have a reason to come to here more often.

Found this place on yelp and had no idea it was a food cart, being from Portland, this was a pleasant surprise. We got there apparently 1 minute before they closed but we had no idea until they started closing things up. They weren't rushing us out at all! We asked if they wanted us to take it to go but they insisted we stay and enjoy! Super friendly people. The owner, I assume, came out and was tossing dough out on the street. He put on a kind of fun little show, showing off for a tour bus. Just great welcoming atmosphere all together.The pizza was very good! The crust was done perfectly! I had the 4 cheese pizza and my husband had the tomato and arugula pizza. We both loved it. It did remind me of pizza I've had in the Mediterranean.As we were leaving and thanking them, the owner, again I assume, came and made sure we enjoyed it and were content. Wonderful experience!

Hidden away in the busy tourist trap of fisherman's wharf, Carmel Pizza Company is a true hidden gem. If you are looking for an authentic wood fired pizza this is the spot! Very tasty and local with friendly staff and very very fast service if you are hungry the pizza comes out extremely fast. It is a little expensive but the product you receive reflects the price. There is no indoor seating but the tables that are there are covered and there are heaters too. If you are looking for a good wood fired style pizza and are in the fisherman's wharf area, this is the place to go.

For us, the pizza lived up to the hype (all those 5-star Yelp reviews)!Such a cute, casual place... plenty of heaters to keep you warm, cute plants and decor. The service is also very casual and friendly/homey. We ordered one Margherita pizza with added ham and mushrooms to share, and an order of the garlic cheese bread. It was a perfect amount for the two of us! The crust is thin, crispy, and wasn't soggy - like other wood-fire pizzas we've tried. The sauce and cheese combination was delicious --- comparable to the best pizzas we've had in Italy!
