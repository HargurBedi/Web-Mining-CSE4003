I've been here several times now and each time have found it to be solid. One of my colleagues has labeled E&O as her favorite restaurant in SF, and while it doesn't rank as high as all that for me, it's a good place for a tapas-style meal. I've had many of the non-seafood items on the menu, with highlights below:-Wood-Roasted Edamame Beans: I mean, yes, it's edamame...maybe it's the Maldon salt on them, but they're really good.-Lamb Naan: The.Bomb. The lamb is marinated well, tender and juicy, and balances well with the naan. Frankly, I was surprised that somewhere as overtly fusiony as E&O did this well, but I ordered a few of these and ate them all myself!-Beef Short Rib Sliders: These are OK but not mind-blowing and I think the particular pickled veggies they use totally overpower the dish. It's like, "Oh, here's some pickled radish and...is that...essence of beef?"-Chicken Lettuce Cups: My favorite thing on the menu. Okhthanksbye.-Crispy Chicken Spring Rolls: I like that these are actually heavy on the veggies. Really nice and light every time. I've found the service here to be super hit or miss. The last two times, flagging someone down required a bit of work, although the staff were pretty friendly when you could find time. Note that it can get pretty loud in here, especially on weekday nights, but that's sort of par for the course for a restaurant like this one.

TLDR - My favorite sit down experience in the union square area!Well shoot - I have to say this place is next level. I have no idea why my sister rated it 3 stars but she is a dummy!The sliders, burger, and the satay are next level bomb! Sliders are amongst some of the best i've ever had. They're succulent and a dope treat.Naan for the appetizer is legit. Lychee martini is great.com as well!

I have been to E&O twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch and I have to say that the quality of the food and service is great at either time. When you go in for dinner, make sure to make a reservation because there is usually a wait. When we went in for lunch, there were quite a few people there but we were sat right when we walked in.The hosts and servers were very welcoming and warm. They were able to give us their opinion and preferences on the food and drinks available. The setting and atmosphere was nice and decorated just enough.For lunch we ordered the three course meal and shared it. We added on the corn fritters as an app and it was as good as it was the first time.Corn Fritters - They were nice and hot right out of the fryer. They were very crispy and had a nice texture to them. The sauce that accompanied it was right.Butternut Squash Dumplings - The dumplings were cooked well and had a little chew and bit to them. The filling was a great mixture of sweet and salty. The curry based sauce was a great addition to the dish.Pork Ribs - The pork ribs went nicely with the coleslaw. They were tender but not overcooked. Not quite fall off the bone, which was great because it gave it a nice texture.Definitely a fan of E&O and will be back for lunch or dinner anytime I'm in The City.

This review is for the restaurant's Happy Hour. I've been here 3x now for happy hour and have always left happy and full. Their HH starts at 3pm (including weekends)! My favorite things to order from their HH menu are their $1 oysters and $1 butternut squash dumplings, and corn fritters. If I'm feeling extra adventurous (and hungry) I go for their pu pu platter.Also, a little birdie told me that this restaurant is great at accommodating tables for large group dinners!

This review is only for their happy hour menu. Coworkers and I came here on a Friday around 5:30pm with no reservations. Bad move on our part. However, we decided to stay in the back table even though we weren't going to get those dollar oysters. Right when we were about to go to our table, another hostess was very nice enough to get us seated for happy hour! It was super nice of them to accommodate to our party and make sure we got our happy hour orders on time because we literally had only 5 minutes before it was over. Recommendations:- Green tea vodka- bourbon if you like the strong drinks- corn fritters- pu plater- OYSTERS!!

Visited E & O Kitchen before heading to a comedy show up the street at The Shelton. The restaurant is rather large by SF standards, housing multiple dining rooms, a lounge in the front, a balcony with more seating, and an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant. My date and I started off with a Tequila Tamarind (mine) and E & O's take on an Old Fashioned (his). Both drinks were strong, although we ordered two rounds and the drinks had different garnishes each time, which I thought was kind of odd.The menu leans towards Asian-fusion with a few oddballs thrown in. Appetizers range from $9-$15, while big salads and full entrees range from $16-$30. I opted for the chow mein at the suggestion of our waiter, which was very good. For $17, I got a big bowl of garlic and ginger noodles with sauteed mushrooms, snow peas, cabbage, and a lot of chicken. I couldn't finish the whole thing, and I was hungry. My date went with the pad thai, which was also tasty but had a pretty serious kick. Overall, we could have done with smaller portions at a lower price point. The absolute star of the night, though, was the butternut squash dumplings served with a creamy coconut curry sauce--absolutely not to be missed! Service was gracious and attentive, especially given the size of the restaurant. Definitely a great spot to go if you have other things to do in Union Square.

We had a company dinner here so the menu was fixed. Everything was excellent but the stars of the evening where the appetizers. Sobo noodles, corn fritters, lamb meatballs, shrimp satay all were out of this world. The lemon grass tofu as an entree was beautifully prepared. If I could make tofu taste that delicious, I could easily be a vegetarian.

When asian fusion tastes funky it tastes really funky.Super dry Nan bread starter. Worse than from the microwave.The E and O burger that I had was undercooked and raw not once but two times so I sent it back. The weird part is they still couldn't get it right and the waiter apologized but I still got another raw burger in the end.The ahi tuna tartar was one of the worst I've ever had. Bland and it didn't taste fresh. Like it was sitting on the counter at luke warm room temperature.The ginger cookie dessert tasted like it was from the $1 store and the line in coconut Panna Cotta was bitter and didn't even taste like coconut.And $9 for dry cold green beans was also a no go.....This was a total waste of money.

Came here with a group of friends the other night and got the Indonesian Fried Rice. The fried rice was decent, but definitely overpriced. I would recommend coming back for Happy Hour as I've heard those prices are better. The restaurant itself has a really nice and modern ambiance and is a cool place to bring a group of folks.

We were drawn in by their Happy Hour menu while waiting for the Chinese New Year Parade to start. There wasn't space in the bar area, so we sat with three other parties in the front lounge area. I remember they had decent happy hour cocktail prices. I liked the idea of the Char Siu Black Cod $27 I ordered. It had a nice sear on it and the the texture of the fish was excellent. Sadly the fish was too salty. When I tried to eat the side of greens to help, but the greens were even saltier. The Fritter Burger $18 was a cute but became a huge mess when the corn fritter "buns" fell apart. You gotta eat it with a knife and fork. The Happy Hour $1 butternut squash dumplings were okay. We were mostly ignored and had to ask for utensils after some of the food was brought out. We had to request refills on drinks also.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!Great service. Even managers sharon and ace was on the floor passing out and picking up plates. We came for happy hour and had fritters, ahi tartar, chicken and steak satay, ceviche, oysters, dumplings and it was all yummy. My only wish is that I could've ordered the steam buns but server said it was only during lunch hours. But all was great.We came a month later and service was great again. Umberto the bartender was friendly and awesome. We had green beans, lamb naan, spare ribs, and ginger cookies. It was good size portions for small plates. This place has good food and great service. And it's a very clean and intimate place. We love it!

Came here for happy hour - the food and drinks were great and came at a good deal!I just stuck with a Pilsner beer and my friend tried the green tea vodka cocktail, which definitely tasted like both green tea and vodka. My personal favorite dish was the dumplings in red curry sauce - so, so good! I only ordered 3 because I wasn't sure how a butternut squash dumpling would taste, but next time I go back I will make sure to order 8 or so. The $1 oysters were pretty good, as were the corn fritters. Chicken satay was a little bit dry and bland, but otherwise passable. My only criticism is that the food came out at different times, so I was almost done when my friend's food came. The restaurant did not seem overly busy so I felt that it could have been timed better. Overall, the food's quality makes up for it.

Made a reservation for 5:45pm just in time for the Happy Hour menu. We got here a few mins early, but they still happily seated us.PARKING + AMBIENCEIt's SF, so unless you want to pay an abysmal amount of $$ for parking garages, public transportation is an efficient option. The restaurant is a short walk from the Powell St. BART station. The restaurant's ambience is perfect. The dim lighting and stylish dining decor greet patrons with a truly enjoyable dining experience. The noise level is loud, with everyone chatting away, but not too loud that it overpowers any conversations to be heard at your table.FOODE&O's Happy Hour is 3-6pm (Mon-Sat) and it was a great value! Cheap prices and good portions, you could have a whole meal just off the happy hour menu. Butternut Squash Dumplings ($1): the texture of the dough was notable, but the sauce was savory and flavorful. 4/5 Oysters ($1): They were okay. Not the best, but it's $1. 3/5Indonesian Corn Fritter Bites ($3.5): I didn't like these, flavor was dull and bland. Maybe I just don't like corn fritters. 1/5Ahi Tuna Tartare ($3): Delicious! They gave a portionable amount of ahi tuna, we ordered them twice. 5/5Beef Short Rib Slider ($4): Came with taro chips. The meat tasted like stew beef, the sliders are filling. 4/5As for their main menu, we weren't impressed. Food was just average and not worth the price. Portions are large, but the food quality was missing something. Indonesian Fried Rice ($17): Flavors were okay, but it tasted just like average fried rice, nothing outstanding. 3.5/5Pad Thai ($18): Not your typical authentic pad thai, and that's not a positive attribute. The flavors of the dish were meh. 2/5SERVICEFriendly customer service right from the beginning. We were seated immediately since I made a reservation in advance. Our waiter was delightful and attentive, he asked us for any last calls from the happy hour menu, which was a nice gesture. Great hospitality!CONCLUSIONIf you decide to come here, make sure to take advantage of the happy hour menu, it's a great value. The main menu dishes were not worth the price, too expensive for mediocrity. I would only come during happy hour.

Although I didn't make it in time for HH this is a solid place to grab Asian food w/ a twist. I enjoyed the ambiance of this place. It's basically 3 floors but the top/bottom are mainly for events while the entrance floor is for dining. It does get pretty packed even outside HH times so I recommend reserving a table beforehand. WHAT WE GOT: - Squash dumplings- One of my favorites of all the dishes in addition to the ceviche. They let you order in a serving of 5 or 6. The dumplings were filled with a load of squash and the wrapping tasted fresh. The sauce was very flavorful and went well with the dense dumplings. GET THIS! - Ceviche - My second favorite dish. Unlike normal ceviche this one has a coconut kick which is a. Ice twist. Also A-1 presentation on being served in a half coconut shell as well! On the sides they also lay out thin taro chips that paired great with the ceviche. - Drunken Noodle- The noodles had a great texture but I think it was hard to eat for me because of how salty it was.- Roasted Eggplant - can't go wrong with eggplant. Great flavor and roasted well. Nothing too spectacular about this one though. - Corn Fritters - it seems like this was something everyone tries so we ended up getting them too. They give you 2 per order. The fritters are HUGE and composed of tons of sweet corn. I enjoyed eating them since they added a nice mix in texture with all of the softer dishes we got. The sauce they pair it with is tasty as well. I docked a star because service was meh. We felt rushed to order/eat and also a little pressured to buy drinks. When we didn't we were overlooked - con of looking young I guess? For all the above we paid around $85 for 2 people outside HH. A little on the pricier end but I'll be sure to make it before 6PM next time.

I'm usually not a fan of anything fusion, but my date said he loved it. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. We had the calamari, chickpea fries, egg rolls, and the prawn salad. My favorite dish was the salad, and I loathe salad. This salad was like a party in my mouth! The salad had prawns, cucumber, mango, mandarin oranges, cashews, mint, cilantro, and maldon salt. The salt complimented all of the ingredients perfectly! I may have to come back just for the salad. Oh, the lime in the coconut cake was fantastic. The cake was moist with bits of coconut flakes and a hint of lime.

TLDR - Solid Asian fusion, nothing amazing but they have a great HH for foodCame back here for happy hour and thought it was one of the best HH deals for food I've had in SF. They have $1 oysters and dumplings and other bar bites for $2-4, or you can order a whole platter sampling most of the bar bites for $24. My friend and I got the Pu Pu Platter, 2 oysters and 2 dumplings, which was plenty for a meal and only $28 before tax/tip!Food wasn't necessarily amazing, but I'd definitely recommend if you're looking for a more affordable HH. They have drinks for $6 too.* PU PU PLATTER ($24) - 4/5[fritter bites, 2 sliders, 2 ribs, 2 chicken satay, 2 ahi tartare, taro chips & pickled veggies]Good value and good if you're like me and enjoy sampling a little of everything.- INDONESIAN CORN FRITTER BITES - Fried and greasy but not bad- BEEF SHORT RIB SLIDERS - Pretty meaty but a tad dry and lacking a little in flavor- TAMARIND & HOISIN PORK SPARE RIBS - 1 was tender, 1 was a little chewy. Flavor was sweet and tangy/citrusy- CHICKEN SATAY - Pretty tender chicken. Plain on its own but there's a peanut dipping sauce to go with it. Or pair it with the red curry sauce from the dumplings if you're getting those.- AHI TUNA TARTARE - Basically your classic tuna poke.* DUMPLINGS ($1) - 3.5/5[butternut squash, red curry sauce]Meh, the overall texture of the dumpling was too mushy and doughy. I did like the red curry sauce though, which I'd recommend saving to dip your taro chips or chicken satay in.* OYSTERS ($1) - 4.5/5[local variety, kim chee cocktail sauce]Fresh! Loved the unique cocktail sauce. The kimchee gave it a little kick.--------From a previous lunch visit:* PRAWN SALAD ($16) - 3.5/5[gulf white prawns, cucumber, asian fruit, cashews, onions, fresh chilies, thai basil, mint, cilantro, lemon oil, maldon salt]Crisp and fresh ingredients, but a little disappointing in flavor. I was expecting sweet and spicy from the fruit and chilies, but the chilies didn't have any punch to them. The prawns were big and well cooked but few in quantity.* INDONESIAN FRIED RICE ($17) - 3.5/5[gulf white prawns, char siu pork, vegetables, egg, chilies]We got the fried rice without the chilies and it honestly tasted like any other fried rice, just greasier and saltier. Maybe it would've been more interesting with the chilies.* DRUNKEN NOODLES / PAD KEE MAO ($16) - 3.5/5[broad rice noodles, ground pork, chinese broccoli, chilies, basil]Not bad, but again not very memorable. The noodles and pork were cooked nicely, but the dish was definitely on the greasy side.

This is like a global-fusion with dishes from all over the world. Day or night, this place is full of energy and laughter and puts a smile on your face.Very modern upscale interiors with booths n high chairs, with matching interior brightness to outside light that keeps the atmosphere relaxed and natural.Service is ok. Staff is very polite and accommodating but not that attentive. Gotta earn their attention to even get a glass of water.I have mixed feelings about their food. I really liked the presentation of their ceviche. It was served on a cracked half of coconut on a bed of yuca fries. The sweetness of the yuca chips balanced (or tried to) the tanginess of the ceviche. It was a creative idea, but failed in execution. Ceviche was a lil too tangy and i wonder what they do with all those coconuts? Pad Thai tasted funny but their fried rice was really good. So, in my opinion instead of putting too many items on the menu from all over the world not getting them right, they could just focus just Asian food and get it right.I will go there again because its a fun atmosphere and food isn't that bad.

This is one of my favorite places to go for a relaxed, slightly higher up than casual, dinner. I'm usually pretty skeptical about asian fusion but for the most part, E&O handles it really well. If you're coming around dinner time, especially during happy hour, I would recommend that you make a reservation because it can get really busy. There's also a bar here so the ambiance is quite noisy. However, they tend to have dim candle light so it doesn't actually feel like you're in a bar.Their small plates are probably my favorite part of the menu. The corn fritters are a must get in my opinion! I like them alone but the corn fritter burger was a delight as well. The ahi tuna tartar is another one of my favorite dishes. I will say that their food tends to err on the side of salty especially their ribs and sliders so just be aware. If you're looking for a sampler, the pu pu platter is a nice 2 person sampler plate for $24. You won't be very full off of it but it's great if you're not that hungry.

My girlfriend took me here on her lunch break. I had a wonderful time! The restaurant had the perfect ambiance as far as lighting and seating goes, and it definitely had that modern upscale touch. Service speed was moderate at peak SF lunch hours. I had the fried rice which had to be the best I've ever had. No disrespect to my mom, but this killed all the fried rices that I've had in many moons. I was so impressed with the amount of shrimp that was in my bowl too. Don't sleep on the lettuce wraps either! Those are my girlfriends favorite! Have them as an appetizer or you can even make that your entree and it will be more than enough. This place is great.Warning: I felt rather underdressed wearing just a T-shirt. Make sure to come with at least a button up :)

I've been to this place many times, all of them being business meals. Food is delicious and more fulfilling than you think. I don't like leaving food on my plate, but I had to do it every time I ate at E&O. The atmosphere is better for a dinner rather than lunch. Lighting is somewhat low, and table are super close so careful what you say :)My biggest complaint is about waiters. They come literally every 3 minutes and ask if everything's OK. First 3 times are fine. However, when you're in the middle of a conversation and someone keeps interrupting you when you haven't eaten anything since the last time they asked it starts to get annoying. Please let me eat and enjoy my night with my guests!

Great happy hour menu. They have six dollar drinks and wine. Also very cheap finger food. Ordered a dozen oysters (much regret) and two ahi tuna tartes. They were probably the worst oysters I've ever had. The oysters had either broken shell or sand in every single oyster I ate! It was so gross and really annoying to eat.Despite the bad oysters, the bartender was kind and helpful in selecting drinks. I also tried the prickly tequila, which consisted of prickly pear, tequila, and lime. Very interesting drink! I really liked the prickly pear, considering I have never seen any other bar offer this before. Really nice place to go for happy hour, despite the horrible experience I had with the oysters.

I've only been here for happy hour, but this is truly one of the best happy hours in all of SF. It's one of the rare ones where it actually feels like a DEAL, rather than the usual scheme of SF happy hours where the portions are just smaller but the price actually doesn't proportionally get decreased and you end up paying more. No, this place actually has legit $6 drinks (their maple old fashioned was excellent) and great food deals, with their corn fritters for $4 being the main attraction. The bartender was very on top of things and made excellent drinks. Definitely going to be my go-to HH destination from now on.

The aroma at e&o is intoxicating! I ordered their popular Indonesian corn fritters, recommended by Brian Boytano from Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. But it was okay. I couldn't get the GMOs off my head . 3 star solely for the over-hyped fritters, but 5 stars for decor, cleanliness, and staff pleasantries. I'm visiting and have 2 more restaurants to hit up tonight but did not tell the waitress. She didn't even bat an eye but lite up when i ordered only one thing that cost $10. Good job, San Francisco lady, ure awesome. Keep up the good work!

We hadn't been here for several years and decided to give it a try. Hosting friends from out-of-state, we wanted a restaurant that was unique, as well as delicious. E & O fit the bill on both counts.Although there were many interesting dishes on the dinner menu, the reviews of the Happy Hour menu were so glowing, we had to try it. (Note: be sure to mention your desire to eat from the Happy Hour menu when you make your reservation. If you are seated in the 'restaurant', you can't get it. Even though the tables in the 'bar' are just as nice, and literally right next to each other. Go figure.)We ended up getting two pupu platters, which provided a huge variety of appetizers--enough for a meal! We ordered two of these for four of us and had plenty to eat. The platters were $24 each at Happy Hour, included everything from chicken satay to tuna sashimi, corn fritters, and lots of other goodies. Totally worth it!!Also, during Happy Hour, wine (and Champagne!) was only $6 a glass. Many wines, beers, and cocktails to choose from.Go at Happy Hour and enjoy!

Came here last Friday for their happy hour (Mon-Sat, 3-6 pm) and had a great time!When I got there, I asked for a table for two and they sat me in the back. However I didn't realize this was the dining area, so when I asked for the happy hour menu, the waitress told me happy hour was only served at the bar and at the high top tables in the front area (some private, some communal). Keep that in mind if you're there for happy hour!My friend and I tried the following:Butternut squash dumplings with red curry sauce ($1 each): the dumpling itself tasted a little bit sour to me, but I really enjoyed the light curry sauce it was served inOysters ($1 each): this is what we came for, and it did not disappoint! I forgot where our server said our oysters were from, but it was somewhere off the Washington coastIndonesian corn fritter bites ($3.50): each order comes with 3 small pieces and they were SO good. This was probably our favorite hot small bite. Definitely get this if you like sweet cornAhi tuna tartare ($3): I'm usually not a huge tuna person, but this dish had been liberally smothered with sesame oil and came served on a nice crunchy chip, so I really enjoyed itTamarind and hoisin pork spare rib ($3): This was okay, but my opinion is probably biased because I'm not huge on the taste of tamarind. I got this so there would be some actual meat in this (otherwise light) mealMushroom satay ($2): each order comes with one skewer with a portabella mushroom slice. I love portabellas so I liked this, but thought it was a bit pricey at $2/skewer.We each got a drink as well, but neither of us particularly liked our drinks. I had the sutter punch (vanilla bean infused rum, pineapple gum, lime) and my friend had the daily white wine.This happy hour wasn't as cheap as I thought it would be...we each ended up paying around $34! But overall we enjoyed our food if not our drink so I would like to come back again sometime.

Let's be honest - "Asian fusion" is almost always a total miss (typically in the form of a mediocre Indian menu with chow mein thrown into the mix). However, I was seriously impressed with almost everything we ate at E&O given the diversity and range of the true fusion menu. The casual yet ambiance with great service is the icing on the cake. We started off with the butternut squash dumplings based on our waitress's recommendations - these are a must. The flavorful and tender dumplings in the rich red curry are a unique and memorable combination. Entrees we went with the steak satay and lamb naan. The satay wasn't anything particularly unique or memorable. That being said, very well cooked steak with a great hint of seasoning - as straightforward as it gets. When it came to the lamb naan, I was honestly surprised with how much my Indian palate enjoyed it. Ground lamb was excellently seasoned, the bread was soft, and the raita yogurt sauce was an awesome complement. Also ordered a side of eggplant and tofu. It looked great, but was honestly pretty flavorless. Dessert menu looked bomb, but I'd already sinned with a double scoop of Ben & Jerry's earlier in the day. Hope to be back soon to try them out and get a second crack at the fantastic fusion dishes! (Also, the happy hour deals were super compelling).

Come here for happy hour at this in the Asian fusion place. The ambience is quite dark inside - better for later dining than lunch. For happy hour:- miyagi oysters are quite good but there is shell in the oyster so be careful when eating them or requesting the person shucking it to not leave any shells inside the oysters. - butternut squash dumpling is put together well but I am not a huge fan of sweet dumpling (from the butternut squash). Go for the savory ones on the main menu- spare rib is a fantastic deal. Get as much as you want (they are pretty large). Skip the cabbage on the side.I also had the Indonesian corn fritters here which are quite good and original. NON-HAPPY HOUR:- crispy chicken spring rolls. Done well here. Solid. Recommend- chicken lettuce cups - bland. Skip. - roasted asparagus - bland. Not a fan.

Came here on a Friday night. Felt bad because I recommended it to my husband and had really bad service. The restaurant itself is nice and the food is good but our waitress tonight was horrible. She only came around to drop off our order and never checked on us. I literally had to shout out for her to get her attention as she passed us. I understand it was busy but I also saw other servers being attentive to their tables. Very disappointed.

Great atmosphere and fantastic service!We sat up at the bar and Andy the head bar tender was a class act. He had put together some of the best cocktails I have tasted and his personality lit up the entire bar. What a class act all around. I would highly recommend coming here any night of the week.

You ever have a long, and rough day from work and think to yourself, "man I need a beer." Go here. Their happy hour will get you out of you post-work day slump. Here's the cure: bring a co-worker and order a Pilsner & the pu-pu platter to share. This will make your day a lot better. The pu-pu platter is a smorgasbord of Asian fusion bites.-Chicken satay: juicy chicken on a skewer paired with a peanut sauce-Corn fritter: fried corn with a special sauce-Tuna tartare bites: raw tuna on a small round chip. (I ate this in one bite & it was delicious)-Pork spare ribs: sweet bbq ribs, the meat pretty much falls off the bone-Beef short rib sliders: a bit dry, but dip it in the corn fritter sauce and that brings it back to life. -Taro chips: less guilty version of potato chipsJust some snacks to eat while you discuss how much your work day sucked (:

We went for the happy hour. We ordered 10 oysters ($1 each), tuna tartare, chicken satay, and mushroom satay. All the dishes above were excellent. The sauce for the oysters were a kimchi oyster sauce that was very special and easy to eat.The chicken satay was very soft and tender and was dipped in some peanut sauce.The tuna tartar was placed on a crunchy tortilla like chip and it worked perfectly. The mushroom satay was also really delicious. Overall, a great happy hour dining experience.

Great value for HH.So what I love about their HH is they have a good selection of cocktails/appetizers. The only issue is that I did not love the actual taste of the appetizers, which is why I probably would not come here to eat. Definitely would continue to visit for drinks!Place gets pretty packed in the evening, if you're here for dinner, I'd definitely suggest calling ahead.FYI, all the HH portions are small so it'd be redundant if I kept repeating that-Dumplings- these were fine, don't think I'd order again. Maybe as a palate cleanser, though?Tuna Tartare- this was good! Definitely left you wanting more.Oysters- yay, $1/piece. Fine, but like most places when they're producing them in this variety, they definitely tend to get lazy on the shucking so slurp wisely.Chicken satay- probably would avoid ordering this againFritter bites- didn't take a stab at these myself, other friends seemed to be satisfied by themPrickly Pear cocktail- On the sweet side! I didn't order this one but the bar accidentally gave it to me, haha. Not my first choice off the menu.Vanilla infused cocktail- This was fine, almost feels night-capy so be warnedGreen tea cocktail- This one was the winner off the cocktails on HH for me.

They need serious help in Asian cooking...When my server presented the chef's special fried chicken, I was at one point confused that it might be some huge samosas instead. The skin was somehow ripped, mixed with too much flour, and put back to cover the chicken. It was the hardest and thickest fried chicken skin I've ever had! And I can't really eat with hands! My friend kept apologizing because it was her idea to order it and share.Now I can only picture some chefs making up dishes with their smatter asian cooking knowledge and their own twists in the kitchen......So please, do not come here for decent Asian food.

Three words: CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPSAbsolutely delicious and tasty! Cost about $16. The lettuce is cut and served fresh to order and the chicken was bursting with flavor. Made with ground chicken, water chestnuts, shiitake mushrooms, and topped with pine nuts. The dish is more than enough for two people to share and feel free to ask the server for more lettuce. I did, haha just cause we had more chicken than lettuce which I thought was a great thing. To get the whole experience, don't forget to try the sriracha sauce on the chicken lettuce wraps. It added the perfect amount of heat for each bite. If you're not a hot sauce fan, this dish is very appetizing on its own. Literally, I have nothing, but good things to say about this.I also ordered the Satay Your Way $17 - it was a mix and match of 4 satays of your choice: pickled vegetables, rice, chicken, shrimp, beef or mushroom. It was my first time, and I ordered one of each which was recommended by the server. The chicken, shrimp. mushroom was cooked to perfection and the meat was very tendor. She also shared with us the new drinks on the menu, one of them was lyche and the other was prickly pear. Both were very refreshing and you will definitely enjoy it to the last drop.

On a Friday night, we were able to sit down right away and enjoy an excellent meal. The mushroom dumplings were amazing! The sauce was a soy, plum gravy that was so good you will want to lick the bowl! We also enjoyed the Japanese bop and portobello satay. The flavors all complimented each other and we topped it off with some ginger beer and a "not a colada"!

Overpriced, mediocre Asian Fusion food. Came here for my best friend's birthday and we were sorely disappointed. The ahi tuna tartare is one of the worst I've ever had - bland and flavorless. The tuna tasted old and was served room temperature. The salt and pepper calamari tasted like cardboard with a dry crumbly batter that had an unpleasant powdery texture. The chickpea fries, while an interesting concept, fell flat in the execution. They should be crispier on the outside while retaining their creamy center. Instead they were limp, mushy rectangles of pureed chickpeas. The kennebec fries were the only thing we ordered that was edible. We were so glad we started with shared small plates so we didn't have to suffer through more. We ended up going somewhere else after for a drink and appetizers to get the bad taste of E&O Kitchen out of our mouths.

E&O was a bit of a mixed bag. Some dishes were amazing while others missed the mark. Service was also spotty... started out strong but then forgot about us for long stretches of time. It truly is Asian fusion with dishes ranging from India to Cambodia. Successes were the tartare which is poke style, Indonesian fried rice, and the ginger cookies. I was not as impressed with the satay, steak, or corn fritters which seemed too fried. The place was packed so it must be popular, but for that price you might as well head to The Slanted Door!

I honestly try and avoid crossing the bridge and paying toll unless it is unavoidably necessary. This place could have been avoided. My sister and I came here for her friend's birthday dinner. The ambiance and vibe of this restaurant is one of the few things I liked about it. The restaurant is dimly lit and had an air of relaxation circulating. The crowd age ranged from mid 20s to late 30s. I really enjoyed just being in here. This could be a good spot for a stereotypical date, with a casual feel. I know that there is an issue when I eat somewhere and feel the need to get food from another place when I leave. This was, unfortunately, the case after I left here. The 3 stars is for the food. I paid $30 for food that I did not enjoy. I ordered the butternut squash dumplings with chicken skewers. The dumplings dish was the best out of the two, but it only came with about 4 dumplings. It came in yummy coconut sauce. The chicken skewers was a really bad decision. It was poorly seasoned and a regretted every bite. This appears to be a good place to go to for drinks. I chose not to drink adult beverages, so I ordered the House Made Ginger Ale. Yummy! You could really taste the ginger. I would come back I here for drinks and good company and most likely avoid the food.

Asian cuisine at it's finest in the heart of San Francisco! I had never even heard of this place before my 1st visit here. Large space with beautiful high ceilings just the way I like it. Pleasantly greeted by our host right away. I told her I was new there and I'd like to check this place out before being seated so she let me go upstairs for a peek and there were plenty of tables as well as private rooms available for guests. Good to know!Water was offered right away because the area where we were seated felt extremely warm especially for it being such a cold night out. Our waiter helped me pick a cocktail and I stuck with it for the rest of the night because it was very refreshing and delicious. I got the "Vodka Thai Basil"... I didn't take a picture even after ordering it multiple times! Super fail.The food was great! I went with three friends so don't think I ate all of this by myself :)*Starters*Short ribs -melt in your mouth, I wish I got this as my main dishFried Calamari - so crispy but still felt so lightPork dumplings - wouldn't mind bathing in this dumpling juiceTuna Tartar- very fresh fish. loved it!*Main Course*I got the Pad Thai and I don't remember it saying it was going to be spicy but I was pleasantly surprised that it was "make your nose run" kind of spicy.No dessert for us and we all had plenty of leftovers to take home. Which probably happened because we over-ordered on the appetizers.

Haven't been to E&O in years. Was so excited to go back. Service was meh. Took way too long for drinks and in between courses. Food could've been prepared better. Very greasy. And too much filler (think green onions, cilantro, cabbage shreds, etc) it took away from the dish we ordered and in my opinion any dish over $16 should not be primarily filler. They should be "garnished" not filled with it. Prices were so incredibly high for the dish. We were having a family birthday celebration, and then they sat a baby in a high chair right next to us. And the tables are tight. All we heard all night was baby screeching, and overly busy parents right next to us. So we could not relax and their volume and movement became such a distraction from our leisurely dinner. All in all not a good night.

Eclectic pan-Asian menu. Had the lamb Naan and their take on Nasi Goreng. Both were very nice. Creative cocktail menu too. I had two Gin Rosemary cocktails which had a bright citrus flavor but not much herbal taste. Price was... San Francisco, which is to be expected.

It's best to reserve a spot by calling them ahead of time during busy hours for this restaurant. We came here a bit early for our reservation today, but they were kind enough to let us sit around and seated us really quick. We were expected to get those high tables, but since we came a bit early, we were being able to be seated at the regular table. The setting is really dimmed and I laughed at my friend who use her phone flashlight to read the menu. The sever is really sweet, asking if we enjoyed the food. We decided to do family style and here's what we ordered:Small-Indonesian Corn Fritters (Highly recommend! It comes with the special sauce and it's super crunchy) Rolls&Dumpling-Butternut Squash Dumplings (it's ok, nothing special, taste like curry) Rice&Noodles-Indonesian Friend Rice (pretty delicious , also recommend getting this)Drunken Noodles ( there were so little noodles ,'it's ok ) Meat&SeafoodWood Roasted Char Siu Black Cod (NOT WORTH THE PRICE, although it taste good, the portion is so small...good if ur ballin$) Overall, Price sucks for the portion size, but it's not bad for the taste

1:30 pm on a Monday for lunch and they were out of three items including all burgers and gingerbread cookies- both of which I was looking forward to trying. Kind of unacceptable in my opinion. They did have a decent lunch deal which included choice of an appetizer and entree for $24. Three of us split two orders:Appetizers:green papaya & cucumber salad- refreshingly light + sweet and sourbutternut squash dumplings- definitely a highlight of the meal, incredibly rich so you don't need more than 2 or 3 per person, would order these again in a heartbeatEntree:chicken satay- def needed extra peanut sauce but one we got that it was pretty flavorfulpad thai- tad bit spicy for my personal taste but still deliciousWould have loved to finish the meal with a gingerbread cookie which was highly recommended from someone who previously dined here but they ran out. Still bitter.Also, our server was a bit inattentive & awkward, we had to flag him down multiple times anytime we needed anything. Maybe it was just a fluke considering how many great reviews this restaurant has.

OMG ... this place is truly good. Stumbled upon it late one night famished after a long flight. Returned 2 days later to more fully experience all the flavors its menu had to offer. Was not disappointed. Its fusion of myriad Asian flavors is a food dream come true. It's on my list of go to spots in San Francisco. Has a really nice cocktail list as well. The wait staff are friendly, attentive, and helpful in making selections that compliment one another.

WONDERFUL FOOD AND AMBIANCE BUT...Chose this place to celebrate my daughter's birthday b/c it's one of family's favorite restaurant in the city. We are big fans of their food - unique, tasty and nice presentation. Their corn fritters, poke (fresh), lettuce cup, plum edamame...just to name a few of their dishes are always enjoyed by all of us. I've been going there for 18 yrs. now. I would have given a five star for our recent visit, but as a Mom, I was disappointed with the service for our special birthday event. The Service was ok. Don't get me wrong, their staff is very polite, but our waitress (still polite) was not attentive. There is a difference between being polite and knowing how to be effectively attentive to customer's needs. For example, I told the waitress about my daughter's birthday before dinner started and also when I made the reservation. I had to still earn her attention to even order a cake with a candle "way" after our dinner dishes were taken away. And, this is a small gripe, but when it's a birthday celebration, I think the restaurant should have a standard courtesy serving cake. We had just attended another birthday celebration at Water Bar last week and they were very attentive about the event and served a wonderful complimentary cake to my girlfriend's daughter and paid extra attention to her throughout dinner. And, we both spent about the similar amount ($400+). Net...I'll continue to bring my family here, but not for special events.

I've wanted to try this spot for almost a year now when I first noticed it nearby my dentist office. Each time I've passed I've been in a hurry but today I had some extra time so seized the chance to try a new happy hour spot. The ambiance is nice with dimmed lighting and modern fixtures and decor. The more casual seating creates a more laid back vibe where you can feel comfortable coming when you're a little more dressed down. The wait staff as well as the hostess were friendly and attentive. They have a solid variety of food options ($4 and under), a handful of $6 mixed drinks and wines, $4 beers. I ordered the mushroom satay, tuna tartare, and corn fritters from the happy hour menu. The mushroom satay was flavorful with a good portion size and at $2 I would order again. The corn fritters ($3.5) were a good portion size with three included, they were fresh and tasty, would recommend this dish. However, the tuna tartare included one golf ball sized bundle of chip with tuna on it. Even at $3 I was disappointed in the serving size and wish I had instead ordered another mushroom satay. Overall, good location + good service + mostly good value. I would happily come back again if in the area during happy hour.

Was really excited to try this place as the vibe is really cool and offers a nice sit-down lunch environment.Was very disappointed with my meal though, quite possibly the worst pad thai I've ever had. The dish was way to salty, the entire dishy was oily and overall flavor was that of too much salt and oil. The dish advertised "prawns" but that was not what I got. I got literally the tiniest shrimp I have ever seen. They weren't even 1/2 inch. Not sure how they can call that prawns. Several weren't even cooked through, one was completely raw.Needless to say, I didn't finish the meal and hope that the rest of their food isn't that bad.

I came to E&O with two of my friends for happy hour! We saw E&O had really good happy hour deals so we were pretty excited. We got there at around 5 pm and it wasn't crowded at all. The interior and ambiance of the restaurant is super intimate and the lighting is dark! Very nice for a happy hour with friends or date night. :-)We ordered 30 oysters ($30) and the pupu platter for two ($22) and added on another person on our pupu platter for $10! The pupu platter comes with a variety of their appetizers- ahi tuna tartare, beef short rib sliders, pork spare ribs, corn fritters, chicken satay skewers, taro chips and pickled veggies! We thought this was a good deal because we got to try multiple items from the menu. I would say my favorite app was the corn fritters!! I love corn and anything fried so it was basically those two together haha. The chicken satay skewers were also realllly well cooked/juicy and went well with the peanut sauce. We actually got two rounds of oysters (split 15/15) and the first round was pretty small, but the second round ones were huge!! Also loved the kimchi cocktail sauce!I didn't get a drink but my friends got beer and a cocktail, and they enjoyed their drinks! Maybe next time for me!I wouldn't mind coming back for HH but their normal menu items do seem a bit pricey. The service was awesome though! Our waiter was really friendly and was always checking up on us.

I don't know if I am having an identity crisis at this age or if they are. This place really is a true definition of Asian Fusion as the menu items range from naan breads to kimchi potstickers to pad thai...Came here for the happy hour with coworkers, so I can't speak for a true dining experience. However, I do have to say I think their happy hour deals are pretty worth! We actually got everything on the happy hour menu. My memory is little blurry combined with the drinks, but I do remember we thoroughly enjoyed the dollar oysters, dumplings, corn fritters and sliders. Only thing on the menu we didn't like was the Ahi Tuna Tartare as the tuna seemed not fresh.As for drinks, they were just okay, but can't complain about $6 cocktails in downtown/fidi.Recommended? Definitely! Come for the HH M-F 3-6pm.

Sadly, I missed happy hour when I went but we still ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The beef short rib sliders were so flavorful. Meat was not dry and they were served with fried taro chips. You get 3 sliders which is average for an app. The sliders had pickled veggies and cilantro atop the short ribs. So delicious. For entrees we ordered the Shaking Beef and Japanese Bop. Shaking beef had a nice kick to it and the sauce would have gone great with rice. Beef was very tender but it was not serve with anything else. I wish it came with a side of something so you could really utilize the sauce. The Japanese Bop wasn't my favorite. I definitely prefer the traditional Korean dish. I felt this dish was only made to look nice presentation wise rather concentrating on actual taste. It was just ok for me. I would not recommend it. And for the price, you could order something else worth your while. A thin block of pan fried white rice starts the bottom layer, then its topped with pickled veggies, spinach, a fried egg, and some seaweed and sesame seeds. The egg was a little underdone, I don't like when an over easy egg has most of the whites runny. The drink I ordered was really good, but for the price it was a bit small. If I come back to SF I would like to check other places out first. This place is good, but not great.

This restaurant was right around the corner from my hotel on Bush street, so I decided to stop in one night for a quick bite and happy hour drink. I ordered the squash dumplings ($1 each during hh), naan and mushroom satay. I was a HUGE fan of the dumplings. I ended up ordering 4 more (8 total) because I couldn't get enough! The naan was naan, nothing special. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavoring on the mushroom satay. It tasted too much like sauce and didn't have well-balanced flavors. I also ordered a glass of wine. I enjoyed it, but the bartender replaced it when I was nearly done because another patron had complained about his. Two glasses of wine for the price of one?! Don't mind if I do!I thought about those dumplings all day the next day, so when a coworker asked me to find a spot for the two of us to eat dinner, I suggested E&O Kitchen. Although we couldn't get reservations (6:30 on a Thursday night), we decided to walk in and try to get a spot in the bar area. We lucked out and were immediately seated at a shared table. I ordered the full order of squash dumplings (much more expensive outside of happy hour pricing but still just as good!) and the corn fritters (amazing! especially with the sauce). He ordered the pad thai. He said it's the best pad thai he's ever had. He even raved about the bits of tofu (and he's not a tofu kind of guy). He is still talking about his dish a week later. It was that good.Do yourself a favor and check out E&O if you are in the area! You won't be disappointed!

I visited E&O Kitchen with three lady friends. (I'm not bragging, Ok a little.)And we shared several dishes family style.The Panir Naan was great. The wood roasted Edamame not so much. There was little flavor.The Indonesian corn fritters were great but very oily. The crispy chicken spring rolls were perfect. We had a couple others I cannot recall because they were ok not great.E&O is hyped up to be more than it delivers.

WAY overpriced, very average food, below average service. Pad Thai tasted far from authentic, Indonesian rice was okay but overall a very mass America/Cheesecake Factory feel. Servers charged us for an extra dish, and when we asked them to bring a birthday card out for a friend's bday, they forgot and left the card under a plate of asparagus. Smh.
