I've been here a couple times and the wait is ALWAYS long. HOWEVER, the food is sooo bomb. Omelette, sandwiches, french toast, pancakes....orange juice!! Everything is a must try here. I also really like looking at them make the food when you're in line. The display of the food is so aesthetically pleasing that I forget that I just waited for two hours for brunch. Haha! If you're visiting SF and you are only going to have brunch only once... this is where you should go. I know the wait is horrible, but the food is really good. Also, after eating you can walk around Washington Square park and North Beach to walk off the food.

Bookmarked for a while! This was worth the 1.5 hour wait on a Sunday!Ordered:- Dungeness Crab Benedict with fresh baby spinach $27.95- Monte Cristo $13.95- Orange Juice $4.95 L- Mama's Smoothie $6.75Tina's Travels and Tabloid- So let me tell you about my adventure, I ran to the BofA ATM since the window says "No credit cards," technically, they aren't lying, but apparently when we got to the front of the line. We come to find that they take debit cards. Boo, but yay for my morning 0.60 miles work out. ;) On another board, it did state debit cards. Oh well. - Early AM, one of the workers were passing out water since it got hot real quick! Pretty considerate to care for us! Hahah. - How does this work? So they open 8AM and close at 3PM. Wait in line, old fashioned way. - You get to the front is when the gentleman asks how many? You tell him how many people are in your party then you proceed to another line next to the front of kitchen. - The lady at the register was really nice - she's in charge of taking your order, charging you, and relaying the message to either the staff/waitress of how many people you have or telling you where to sit.- One gender neutral restroom in the back through the washing station down the stairs, super tiny one single stall. - The wait wasn't too long for our food, but when it came. All eyes on the monte cristo and benedict! - One taste of the Dungeness crab, it melts in your mouth with the buttery taste. - I cannot say that they aren't popular with the monte cristo, but that dish is well made and I can see why! I was tempted to order a French toast order as well. Glad I didn't since this is like a fusion of i with the delicious roasted turkey breast, honey baked ham, apples (which I couldn't taste), Havarti and cheddar cheese served with homemade jam! The jam with the toast was perfecto! Not overselling here, but this made me full and I only had two pieces along with one egg benedict that I shared. - Can I get another order though?

I went on Saturday around 1 pm and wait for approx 2.5 hours. This is my 2nd time to Mamas and still in love with the Monte Cristo!! We also order the apple crumble, it was super delicious!!Ordered french toast and the egg benedict, both were okay, but definitely for sure you should get the Monte Cristo 10/10!!If you don't want to wait that long, come around 2.30pm. The line was shorter!

Sooo, you wanna call yourself "Mama" huh?Well, let me tell you somethin' "Mama". If you was my mama, and you cooked up a meal like THAT...?! I would not be telling anyone that you were my Mama! Yep... that bad! I call this a classic edition of an "overhyped Yelp restaurant". Overhyped and overrated to the max! Shall I proceed?! Yes, indeed!It aaaalllll started when I reached North Beach. I don't really frequent this part of the city too often because it's always overcrowded and packed with tons of tourists. If I was a tourist myself, I wouldn't have minded so much... but this girl right here has road rage and a bad case of impatience, so I try to avoid areas like this most of the time. I had just hiked Land's End and decided that since I was already in the city, I might as well see what the hype was about. I had bookmarked this place a while ago, but hadn't been in the area for a little while. I trekked my way through the city streets to North Beach and was actually able to find a decent parking spot. I got there right around 1:45ish and waited in line. This place is known to have a line, so I expected it. I figured that it would be worth the wait since it had a high star rating in Yelp and from friends.I had to use the restroom while I was waiting, and the owner (I think?) told me that it was behind the kitchen. This place is TINY... I know it's San Francisco, but when he said behind the kitchen, I didn't think that I'd be all up IN the kitchen with the cooks, body brushing to get by. After squeezing in between the cooks, I walked down stairs outside to a portable sized restroom. I was shocked. For such a busy and popular establishment, I couldn't believe that THIS was their bathroom! If you're claustrophobic, you might want to hold it! I'm just glad that it was clean and that there was toilet paper. I went back up and noticed that the line had gotten longer. As I waited, I struck up a conversation with a family that was visiting from the south. I overheard someone saying that Mama's was cash only. At this point, I had been waiting for a little over 20 minutes. I freaked out because I didn't have any cash. The nice family behind me held my spot while I went to a nearby ATM to get cash. But, what baffled me was that there was no clear sign that said cash only in their window. It would have been helpful to see it beforehand! I got back in line and waited for another 15 minutes until I finally made it inside. Since I was inside, I assumed that I would be getting seated. Nope... what they do is, you order at the register, and then stand there and wait until a table opens up. How awkward! I decided to order their crab cakes Benedict special and banana smoothie. They finally sat me at a table about 10 minutes later. But damn... it was the most uncomfortable feeling ever! When I looked up, I could see the people standing and waiting there just staring at me. People just waiting to see when you'd be done eating. But not just the people waiting... the cooks and servers too. I hadn't even gotten my food yet, and I already felt like I was being rushed.My banana smoothie came first. It was decent, definitely made with fresh banana, but not work 7 dollars. My crab cake Benedict arrived next... and what a disappointment it was! First off, the portion size was SUPER small! Two small ass benedicts with maybe 6 or 7 potato slices. Um, WHAT? If I'm paying you $25 for breakfast, you better FEED ME damnit! I cut into the Benedict... and I was appalled. No runny egg yolk... at ALL! These eggs were completely overcooked! To top it off, it tasted horrible. Bland and the crab cake was just nasty! I started to wonder if they had served me bad crab. The potatoes were mushy and cold. One of the biggest lies that I've ever told occurred here on this day... when one of the cooks asked me if it was good. My heart was broken, but I did not want to break his heart after what was probably a long work day for him. I just nodded and smiled. What was perhaps the most disturbing element of this entire experience was how the owner/manager continued to let people in while his employees begged him to stop. They looked drained and tired and I overhead him say that he would make them serve people until there was nobody else left at the door. I understand from a business standpoint, but these people have lives and families. It lightweight sickened me, and I started rushing to get out of there because I was so uncomfortable. I also witnessed how they completely forgot to make an order for one of the family's children and then just ignored the mistake. Not sure if this was an off day, but there was just way too many bad vibes in there for me to ever consider going back at this point. 2 stars instead of 1 because of the hard working staff and the friendly owner (he was friendly to the guests at least).

Getting to sit down and eat here was totally a journey...being from out of town, we weren't sure where to park. Confession: we first parked illegally at the gorgeous church next door but soon moved because of Catholic guilt. We ended up valet parking somewhere nearby. Mama's is a small restaurant and there is apparently a wait just about anytime you come. Honestly, waiting outside the restaurant for more than an hour in the sun while tired, hungry, and slightly hungover is not very fun. It was my first time here but my friends had been before and raved about it, so I kept my complaints to myself. Now, although there is a long wait, the family who owns the restaurant is super friendly and will come out and chat with the people in line, explain the menu, answer questions, etc. When you get inside, you can place your order but then, at least in our case, you may still have to wait for a table. Thankfully, the cashier (also a member of the family) chatted us up and helped pass the time. So... customer service is a huge plus! FINALLY, we got a table and relaxed to wait for our food. It came and it was AMAZING. I had an incredible French Toast that was lemony and sweet and perfectly cooked. It 99% made up for waiting. I was still thinking about that French Toast days later. I would LOVE to go back and hopefully will...I feel like it would be a good idea to bring along a packable chair (only half joking)!

Honestly - hands down the BEST breakfast spot in San Francisco. It's a family owned restaurant since 1968 and now running by the sons! Thank god I only live few blocks away cause the line will be ridiculously long. I got there around 7:15ish and got in within an hour which isn't that bad. Service was great and especially the food. BOMBDOTCOM. I will definitely wake up super early and roll out of bed to eat at this delicious breakfast spot. It's something to die for - not gonna lie ha! Also their pastries are always made fresh so you need to try that too!Things I ordered / recommend:- Northern Italian with Pancetta (Italian Cured Bacon), Mushroom, Fresh Basil, Tomatoes and Garlic Jack Cheese- Our Famous Monte Cristo with Roasted Turkey Breast, Honey Baked Ham, Cheddar and Gruyere Cheese battered in Egg and grilled, served with Homemade Jam (MUST GET!!) Those are the only things I've tried but it helps to share plates with friends so you're able to try other dishes!

Their Monte Cristo is some next level shit! It was so damn good, I can't believe my SF native ass never tried this place. Service is definitely off the charts. Everyone who works there knows you've been waiting long and genuinely appreciates your business. They take time to explain their menu and make conversation. Great little brunch place to be if you ain't in a hurry and got time to wait. My friends and I came here around 12:20PM on a Saturday, and we managed to order about an hour later. So not awful, could be worst. Onto the food - highly recommend the Monte Cristo. I don't even know what a Monte Cristo is supposed to taste like but I can't imagine any other places making it as good as Mama's. We also ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and Cranberry Orange French Toast. I ain't a fan of fruits so the French Toast was a no go for me, though my fruit loving friends did seem to enjoy it. Very tart and every bite you take is bursting with orange hinted cranberries. The crab cake benedict had their egg perfectly poached. Got food porn written all over it and their hollandaise is yummmm. I would recommend as well though a bit pricey. Also please note they DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARD. Debit card okay. I think the couple who waited in front of us didn't realize until they got to the front. Yikes. Restroom is a bit tricky. Near the exit, through the kitchen and out the door. It's the large white box looking thing immediately to your left. When in use, you won't even notice its a door because it doesn't have a knob. Would love to go Mama's again though I think I'd wanna come right when it opens. No more 1 hour waits por favor.

holy crap this place is so good! I've been to many brunch places in SF but they don't compare to here! There's so many delicious brunch options here it's so hard to choose! My boyfriend and I got here on a Saturday, 30 minutes before it opened and the line was soooo long already. We waited about 1.5 hours for this but it was so so worth it!! You order first before sitting down so know what you want before getting to the front. I got the monte cristo, my boyfriend for the omelette, and we shared the French toast. Everything was delicious as we expected! The food came out fast! Definitely worth the wait! Long waits but cheap brunch options and delicious food. Great service as well :)

The food was amazing! The owner recommended the Dungeness crab omelette over crab egg Benedict because you can better taste the flavor of the crab meat. He was right!! The omelette was filled with pure and fresh crab meat, creamy avocado and melted havarti cheese. The dish retained the unique flavor of each ingredient yet combined it in a harmonious way.We also got the cranberry orange French toast too. Cranberries and oranges created the right amount of sweetness and sourness. Went well with their homemade jam.Worth the 1-hour wait. Will come back to try mor dishes!

Oh my word... what to say about this place... everything is amazing! From the service to the food!!! The downfall is the wait to be seated which is normally a minimum of an hour but it is totally worth it! You must get the monte Cristo sandwich... It is mouth watering! The omelettes are good but I prefer their sandwiches. And you can't go and not try out their buttermilk pancakes... light, fluffy and so tasty! My new favorite brunch spot :)

Love, love, love this place. Went here on a Saturday morning and waited 2hr 45mins in line. My friends warned me so I was prepared to wait. Not really lasted 1.5 hrs then took a break in a near by church even crashed a wedding... FocusThe aroma was amazing. I felt a little overwhelmed by the menu but I got a preview in the line. You have to order then you will be seated. I was worried bc of my indecisiveness that I would have to make the awkward journey to the front. Luckily my waiter said he could make modifications and add one. The food took a bit to come out but when it did it was amazing. The French toast is on my top 5 best of the best. Chicken apple sausage was amazing... Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection.The restaurant is quite cozy and small but it has a family vibe. I would probably not go on a Saturday again but on a less busy day like Tuesday.

Made it to Mamas!This place is a great little spot to eat breakfast or brunch/lunch as it is only open from 8am to 3pm. All our food was yummy. Only reason why it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because I think it is a little over priced, but service and food is on point.

The line for this place is always long and not completely sure if it's worth the wait but if you have some good buds with you then the time just flies by! You'll mainly find typical brunch foods here at Mamas, some dishes they are known for are the fresh toast, benedict, and pastries they make in house. The portions are massive, service is fast, and the food is good.

Not sure if the line is worth the wait, but I would definitely come back for the cranberry orange French toast! You can get one piece for $4.95 if the sweetness seems too overwhelming. Pairs up well with something savory like their omelettes- a big thumbs up for their portions!! I would suggest coming with a party or no more than 5, since the place is small and the wait might take longer to accommodate your group. The food also took a fairly long time to get (~20 mins), so make sure to set ample time aside for your mamas experience!

I came on a Wednesday morning ~10:10am and finished my food here at noon. The wait (outside line and inside line for register) was about an hour total. It was worth it considering the high quality to price (easily under 20 per person) ratio here. 1. Staff was super friendly and willing to chat with you about recommendations, most popular stuff to try, history of the place, etc2. The French toast was amazing! I had a single piece of the cranberry-orange. It was not excessively sweet. Tart, refreshing, soft.3. The northern Italian omelette has a huge amount of prosciutto, tomatoes, and cheese. It was very rich and savory! Would love to come back and try their crab cake egg Benedict and monte cristo

It was a long wait as everyone says but we arrived at 7:45am and there was already a lineup and to top it off they were late opening too, 15 mins late! I know they're a hot spot but that's a little unprofessional. They only let about 15 customers in at first as there is limited seating, once inside you line up to order and pay. If no tables are available you wait until the cashier asks for your order. It's a system I've never experienced before but seems to work ok for them. Plus the lineup adds to the hype! So was it worth it?? I ordered the Farmers omelette and my husby ordered the French toast sampler special. Both were very generous proportions, mine also came with potatoes and a choice of toast with homemade raspberry jam. Everything was fresh and fillings were enough, nothing super special but the combination of fillings is what makes them good. The French toast is superb! The bread is basically decadent 'loaves!' Dipped in egg and topped with fresh fruits and maple syrup. If you love French toast this is the place to go! The eggs bennies also looked really good. Next time I'm skipping the omelette. The coffee was also a good medium roast and service was basic but also good.

There is always a long, long wait outside of this brunch spot for good reason. It's one of best places (if not the best place for brunch) in the city (and Bay Area in general). No reservations. Either show up super early before opening to beat the crowd or really late right before closing. We started waiting for a table for 2 at 2pm today for brunch on a Saturday and had our food on our table at about 3pm. For comparison, I've showed up closer to prime brunch time before and have had to wait closer to two hours before. Be prepared for a wait. The brunch is unique and unparalleled quality. I also love that it's a family owned place (homemade jam, fresh picked berries and fruits from the farm). They even make fresh pancake batter every 30 minutes! As for food, you must try the Monte Cristo sandwich. This is the most popular item on the menu and they serve about 80 of these a day out of 260 or so total orders. I also love the French toast sampler. I think the ones that are included changes each time, but today I had the cinnamon, lemon berry, and the banana nut. The cinnamon was closest to the traditional French toast, while the lemon berry and banana nut were more like the thicker baked breads turned into French toast. Smoothies are great here. Mimosas are made with fresh squeezed orange juice. You just can't go wrong!

Breakfast all day long, what more can I ask for? Portions are fairly generous, we got two dishes and split with the kids. Omelets are tender, and French toast was delicious. Topped it off with a Bellini, we left energized to climb the Nob Hill. Make sure to bring cash, as you order and pay at the cash register, but there will be some table service that you might want to leave a tip for. One star off for high price, location premium?

Yes there is a wait, expect it, get over it or get out of line. Once inside you stand in front of the kitchen and get your last minute to decide what you want to order and pay in cash, NO CREDIT CARDS. We started with smoothies, one banana and one mamas berry. Both were very good and served in mason jars so they aren't small. We also had a blueberry sour cream crumb cake that was warm and delightful. Following that we had the crab Benedict and monte cristo. Both were incredible! It was totally worth the wait and we can't wait to come back!

The lines are always out the door no matter what time you come, but the food is worth it if you can wait! No credit cards, cash or debit (over $15) only. You pay at the cash register for the food, be sure to have cash on hand to tip your server before you leave. Most people get their famous Monte Cristo: turkey + ham + cheddar + gruyere cheese in egg battered white bread, with homemade jam and a side of potatoes. The homemade jam makes it extra special! The dish is not cheap at almost $15, but it sure is yummy. I love this place and I love the food, but I really hate the way they manage the seating of guests. You're only seated after you order and pay. There was a party of 5 in front of us (party of 2), and we had to stand in line and couldn't order until they were seated even though there were plenty of small tables available (that had no way of seating the party of 5 even if they were moved around). The wait is expected and understandable, but I felt we were penalized just because a larger party was in line in front of us.

I didn't think Mama's was all that great the first time I came here. I ordered one of the french toasts selections and felt that it was just average, definitely not worth the lengthy wait (~1.5 hours) on a chilly morning in San Francisco. However, I decided to give it another shot since my friend wanted to try for the first time .. and I have concluded that Mama's is now my FAVORITE brunch spot in the city. We came around 2pm on a Saturday (they close at 3pm) and only had to wait for about 30 minutes!!! We ordered:Monte Cristo - This was the dish that made me change my mind! It was a delicious savory ham, turkey, and cheese sandwich with the fluffy and crunchy texture of a french toast. I am drooling while trying to describe it. The homemade jam adds a wonderful kick of flavor! Dungeness Crab Benedict w/ Spinach - I'm not really a fan of crab meat but my friend liked it a lot! It was also kinda pricey, almost $25! I am excited to come back (some time around 2pm of course) and try the omelettes that everyone else is raving about!!

Heard about this gem on Yelp and could not wait to try! Went on a Friday at about 1:00pm and had a reasonably short wait of a half hour to get to order. The Monte Cristo was beyond amazing and definitely one of the best meals I have ever had. The French toast sampler was so delicious! The portions were perfect - not massive and not too small.We loved it so much, that we tried to go back the next day (a Saturday) at about the same time. The line was massive and we decided not to wait. But it was definitely worth it if you've never been!

My honest rating for this place is s 3.5. I honestly think it's overhyped because the food and service fell a bit flat for me. Dropped in on a random weekday around 1:30 pm. Thank god there was no ridiculous line out the door at this point. However, there was still a line at the register. So at this place you basically go in, order at the counter, and then wait for a table to clear up while your food is being made. When I first walked in, no one greeted me or even told me how this set up worked. The waitress at the door began talking to the next party and I had to wave someone else down to ask how this worked since it was my first time here. She explained the process to me and I went ahead and got in line. Their menu is displayed on the wall, but you can ask for a menu card if you'd like. Getting a menu card also proved to be difficult because I had to flail around until someone saw that I needed help. Once we did order, the food took SO long to come out. And this is when the place wasn't even crowded. I'm pretty sure waited at least 35 minutes for food. Vegetarian options (if you eat eggs) included omelettes, benedicts, french toast, pancakes, quiche, the california sandwich, and the quesdilla. Foodwise I had the quesadilla without sour cream because I was not feeling any of the sweet options. It came with avocado and salsa on the side both of which were good, but not really anything special. I also had a side of the roasted potatoes. So the quesadilla was good, but was it great? Nope. I know, I know. I decided to get a quesadilla and they can only be so good. But if I'm paying $11.50 for a quesadilla, I expect it to be amazing. I was most sad about the roasted potatoes. They were lukewarm, under salted, and just a bit flavorless. I love potatoes and I wanted to love these, but alas they were just sad imitations of real breakfast taters. The confusing ordering style and service combined with the lackluster food move me to give it a 3.5/5 rating.

Been this place b/c of I saw pplAlways wait there since that place is very small not enough room to seat ppl. I pick a weekday instead of a weekend day, however it still a long line. I did some research about this place, from the picture the most attract me is their toast, it looks very delicious. After 1 hour wait I get into the inside, very small, looks like you stay a very old days home, which make you feel warm, anyway it makes me feel like I'm missing my grandma. I order their toast, and a porch egg. I really really like their toast, for the egg it's ok. I prefer scramble better than other style. If you guys came to SF, this is one of the breakfast place for you to try if you don't mind wait in the line.

Was really excited to try this place and they did not disappoint. Its in the cutest location. Right in front of a park in little italy, facing outwards towards the street. We came at the right time because there was no line at all. I love the old school vibes this place had. All the decor and seating made it all feel home and cozy. What we got: French toast sampler: had fresh berries and bananas with a side of syrup. Oh my goodness it was delicious!! Fluffy and flavor was great. The best part was the berries because they were so fresh!Their famous monte cristo: absolutely loved it. Devoured it all. The jam went really well with the sandwich. Really complimented it well. CoffeeFresh squeezed lemonadeEverything was great. The only thing i would say that sucked bout the experience was the seating. Fairly small and limited. But everything else was awesome. One thing to add, if you want to tip and don't have cash, you can tell the lady at the front as you pay you would like to add a tip so she can incorporate it into your total. Thats the only way. They don't accept credit card and only debit card with a $15 purchase. But you're obviously going to buy more than $15 anyways, so its no biggie.

Be sure to order something you like. I'm not a patient person, and I refuse to stand in line for restaurants (especially when the sun is beating on me), but WOW. The wait was about an hour, arrive early to try to beat the long line as much as possible. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon instead of ham and it was amazing. The Orange juice was fresh and added a good touch to the sandwich. Def worth the wait.

Oh Dear Neptune, where have I been all my life? I freaking loved this place! Please be advised - CASH OR DEBIT ONLY!!! Also be advised - WAIT CAN EXCEED 2+ HOURS!!!My friend and I came around at 10:30am on a rainy day. We thought "oh it's raining and it's cold and it's windy, no one would want to get out of the comfort of their bed and wait in line for this". WRONG. Everyone was carrying umbrellas in the line and we didn't get our food until almost 12:40pm. At this point, you may be wondering "well, is the wait worth it?". If you have never been here ~ then yes! If you have, then it's debatable. The food is really really good, and I think waiting under a hour is so worth it. But when the wait is 2-3 hours, my stomach starts complaining. And when it complains, I start losing patience.On to the food!We ordered the French Toast sampler (which consists of a bananna, cinnamon raisin and cranberry bread French Toast topped with bananas and strawberries). The toasts themselves are already super sweet, so I didn't add the maple syrup. We also ordered the dungeness crab egg benedict with the spinach, with a side of potatoes. Overall, the food was a little on the heavy side. We also got a glass of hot chocolate. Perfect for rainy and cold weather, yumm! The food, service, and ambience here are all a definite 5/5 for me. The downside is the ridiculous wait and no parking.

Mama's is the best breakfast place in San Francisco!! There's almost always a 30-45 minute wait but it is worth it (I hate lines with a passion and it is still worth it). The best time to go is right before they open or later in the afternoon (2:30ish - they serve breakfast all day). My favorite thing to get is the Benedict Paissano (yes it's a secret off the menu item) and it is glorious!! Also their fresh squeeze orange juice and jam (for toast) are incredible as well :) Mama I love you

Homey feel, small space, excellent food. The monte cristo special was to die for! Definitely get this if you come here- it's what they're known for. Worth the two hour wait on a Sunday? Maybe not. But I'd come back very early on a weekend just to get this. The French toast sampler was solid as well- I liked the cranberry orange French toast because it was just the right amount of tangy without being sickeningly sweet.

Hands down my favorite place for brunch. I've been a handful of times, yes there is a huge line with around an 1-2 hour waiting (depending on when you go) BUT it is so worth it! Their Monte Cristo has to be the best thing I've ever tasted. They have the best French toast too!! I've had their banana French toast and chocolate cinnamon, both phenomenal choices. Staff members always so welcoming and friendly. Mama's is a must when in the city!

Unique menu, at least for out of towners. Monte Cristo and Salmon scramble were delicious. Large portions, may be want to take some home. Cool atmosphere, and creative waiting line- order while waiting for a seat allows this cozy place to serve a large crowd without feeling cramped. The outside waiting line could use some shade though, can get pretty hot.

My friend and I arrived on a Wednesday at 11:50am and were seated in half an hour. Since we came on a weekday, I unfortunately couldn't order the Dungeness Crab Benedict that I was really looking forward to. I didn't realize that it was only served on weekends. Derp.To me, out of all the the popular brunch spots in the city, Mama's vibe is the most inviting and homely. Anyone's frown will surely turn upside down upon gazing at all the breads, fruits, and pastries on display. More importantly, the restaurant's logo has hearts on it and its name reminds me of my mom. Call it an unfair advantage. I will surely take mother dearest here next time she's having a bad day.// Crab Cake Benedict ($22.95) - 4 starsSince I couldn't order my Dungeness Crab Benedict, this dish was the logical fallback. It was featured on their specials menu, and I'm definitely glad I ordered it. The crab cake was delicious and the muffin had a nice crispiness to it. Yummy!// Our Famous Monte Cristo ($13.95) - 4 starsI didn't expect the bread to be so soft and chewy when I took my first bite, but I actually kinda liked that it wasn't really crunchy. Came with homemade jam that added a hint of sweetness.ProTip: No credit cards. Debit cards accepted with a $15 minimum.

Arrived for Sunday breakfast at 7:30 for an 8 am opening. There was already a line forming on the side of the building for the doors to open. Make sure you get there early!Food was amazing. I ordered the Northern Italian omelette and it was very filling! My wife ordered the Cranberry Orange and it was very sweet. Recommend ordering one slice instead of the regular plate which is 3 large pieces.When we left, the line was longer and a 2 hour wait. We left around 8:30-8:45.

This place is always busy. Expect to wait about an hour or more. So if you don't like to wait I suggest to really come really early even before they open.But this place is worth the wait... the food is really good and freshly made when order. So much flavor on every bite of the food. If you come in san francisco I suggest and recommend to really trying this place. You wouldn't wanna miss this opportunity to try 1 of the yummy food in san francisco. The wait is so long I remember when we get in the long was long and when we are done it seems like the line never ending that's how good the food is. People are welling to wait just to try this place. That says alot of this place. It's a small place but it has a good and nice feel of the place. The staff is really nice.

The best part of my trip to San Francisco. Yes the wait is very long, but it's worth it. Monte cristo. This is a must. Drooling already. The French toast sampler was also a great choice. It's a good idea to buy a couple of dishes and share because it was all just so good.

Very much worth going for breakfast or brunch. It's an experience but plan to be very early if you don't like waiting.First you have to find parking. Be careful if you're new to the city because the towed signs are easily missed on the side of the pavements. There is an old brick building parking garbage one block south of this corner joint. Second, you wait VERY long in line. ( you most likely would meet a new friend or 2) The food portions are filling but not too big. My wife and I shared a meal actually. Everything is said to be delicious!!!!! We had the California egg special.

After going once, probably won't go again because of the wait but it was really good! The homemade jam they have is actually pretty good! The waiters are super friendly and the place itself is nice.

My friend and I woke up at 730 AM and decided we were determined to eat here. We scurry over around the corner and surprise, surprise, there is a GIANT LIZARD line already formed at the door. The concept is easy: wait in line for an hour or two, order at the counter, be seated, and the food is brought to you. I have noticed that people are mindful of the lines so they don't linger longer than necessary. It happened to be my birthday and the guy at the counter happened to catch wind of that fact, so of course the entire restaurant sang to me. Humiliated or not, I ate it right up! We ordered the salmon benedict and the Monte Cristo. The salmon benny was delicious but the Monte Cristo was out of this world! The man at the counter also sent over free French Toast on the house in honor of my birthday. So. So. Delicious! I understand why the lines are so long even at 745AM on a Saturday! Go check it out!

Waited in line for 2 hours for Sunday brunch, was it really worth the wait? Maybe once to try the food. I ordered the French Toast platter and my friend got the Monte Cristo. We both thought the food was really good, but definitely not worth the wait of 2 hours! The main reason why the wait is so terrible is because there is no proper system of how guests are seated. There is no sign in sheet so you have to wait the entire time around the block of the restaurant in a line, AND once you're inside, you're seated at any empty table. My friend and I noticed so many people sitting in a table for 5 or 6 with only a party of 2! And that was exactly how we were seated! I felt bad that we were using up a large table for just a party of two but I guess that's why the line is 2 hours! The party of 7 behind us had to wait an extra 30 minutes inside until a table opened up for them. I suggest coming on a weekday to try the food, not worth the long wait!

Get there early with cash or a debit card handy! I had the crab cake Benedict, so good! Huevos rancheros were good too! The wait is long but worth it! Great views of Washington park while you eat. Super friendly greeter who guides you on food choices before you walk in the door. He is attentive to any food restrictions so when you walk on to order, you are confident it's what you want and need. Loved this place and neighborhood

After numerous recommendations, I finally willed my way to waking up at an ungodly hour in order to have a chance at eating breakfast at 'Mama's'. Every weekend morning before the restaurant opens, a huge lineup forms right outside. As mentioned, the process is interesting: everyone lines up and orders before being seated. The restaurant itself feels very home-y, albeit, the furniture and decor feels kind of old I came here with a group of five others. The seating lacks some leg room, and the chairs are fairly uncomfortable, but that may also be due to a sore back from a lack of sleep. The food itself was amazing; I ordered the Classic Benedict and shared the French toast sampler with 3 others. The Benedict came with slightly too much hollandaise sauce for my liking, but besides that it was made to perfection; the egg yolk was a perfect combination with the hollandaise sauce, and was topped off perfectly with the english muffin and ham. The French toast was also very enjoyable; there were three separate flavors: cinnamon, blueberry, and cranberry. Overall, this was a good experience, but one that should be reserved for occasion, it was truly a huge effort to get up early enough, and I will look back on this moment with a smile.

We got here at 7:30 AM before it opened and we're first in line. I'm glad we did because it got busy very quick. Once inside, we realized how small and quaint this place was. We ordered Swedish French toast and cinnamon French toast. We had a chocolate crumb cake as sort of an appetizer before meals came. One tip: definitely get here early. It gets crowded and the line goes out the door. But, the wait is certainly worth it. The food is very good and very filling. Also, you cannot use credit cards here but you can use debit cards or cash. Keep that in mind upon arrival.If you're ever in San Francisco and looking for a very very good breakfast definitely swing by here. You will not regret it!

My first "wait in line" brunch experience in SF! My friend is awesome and did most of the waiting, so I can't comment on how long she waited.We were a group of 4 and after a bit, got sent inside where we placed our order and waited to be seated. Note this place is cash only or debit card. We managed to get the cute booth in the front corner.I shared the egg white omelette, chicken sausage, and coffee cake with a friend. I also got to try the French toast. I don't usually go for sweet items for breakfast but everything was delicious. Glad I got to eat here!

3 years ago today I introduced two of my friends at Mama's for brunch and now they're getting married. If that's not a great brunch, I don't know what is. Get ready to stand in line if you want to eat here, we waited almost two hours and started cannibalizing the other people standing in line to hold ourselves over. The food was delicious but 2 hours is a long time for anything.

As we walked up to Mama's, we were introduced to a long line of hungry customers. We expected to wait in line, so it wasn't a huge deal. Food servers checked in on the line every so often, offering coffee (to purchase) and cups of water. Also, bring cash or a debit card. No credit cards are swiped at Mama's. Make sure to ask for a menu so you can study the options as you wait. As soon as you defeat the long line, you're expected to know what you want and order prior to being seated. We waited 45 or so minutes outside. Now onto the food (the reason people wait down the block!) As you wait to be seated inside, fresh baked coffee cakes, carrot cakes, and apple crisp stare at you with an "I dare you not to order me to go" look. We ordered one of each, and I definitely encourage everyone to do the same. Once seated, I ordered the Petaluma Eggs breakfast, cooked to my choice with potatoes and bacon. I also had to try Mama's pancakes and a fresh squeezed OJ. Bottom line: I loved the environment. I loved the options. I may have ordered wrong, as we overheard people saying the monte cristo sandwich is the way to go. The eggs were good, the potatoes were good, the bacon was a bit cold, and the pancakes weren't anything over the top. It was a solid breakfast, but I expected to be "wowed." Everyone should try it. It's a fun place to eat.

I have been wanting to go here for a LONG time. The last time I was here the line was too long. We just got off a plane and we're starving!!! We got there around 9am and the line wasn't long. We waited about about 30-45 minutes, which is understandable because the food is amazing!!!! Plus that isn't long at all if you think about it. When you go out to dinner you end up waiting that long. Just don't go hungry because you can see other people eating. I had the cinnamon french toast with a side of potatoes, and it was amazing! My boyfriend had scrambled eggs, sausage, and Canadian bacon. I took a few bites when he wasn't looking and it was all SO good. Especially the Canadian bacon!! The service and the employees were all so nice and helpful. Great service! I will definitely be going there again whenever the next time I'll be in the city!

The food here is so good and it's worth to wait!I went there alone on a Friday noon. First, I waited outside to get in. And after I got in, I had to wait in another line to order. And then be seated. Although there was much people there and before me, I still spent half an hour to get my brunch But there won't be anything else to say after I got mine! That was amazing! It's like franch toast with ham and egg inside. It teases so good so milky so cheesy. There are four pieces of them with some potato , fruit and a I am not sure what kind of jam. When I had it with the jam, it teases totally different. It is so fresh! That's really amazing!But the only problem is I can't finish all four of them by myself. I was so full with three. I definitely will be there next time and with friends so that I can try more.

No clue why people wait 1-2 hours for this place. I suppose their French toasts are slightly unique, but otherwise it's a pretty basic breakfast. Sooo many other places to go in the city. On a personal note, I could not eat the food there: Once you are inside at the cashier, you watch all the men in the open kitchen. They do not wear gloves to make the food and, after watching all of their hands repeatedly dunk into the vat of egg batter, and all over everything, I became super grossed out and couldn't eat. It felt really dirty to me. I realize some people don't care, but I had no appetite after watching their hands all over my food.

We got into the line outside around 10am and didn't get into the restaurant till about 11-11:15 to order our food on the inside line. The staff was very nice when we ordered our food, but we still had to wait a bit to get seated, but kind of expected that. After being seated, we got our food after about 10-15 mins or so. I got the Chocolate Cinnamon French Toast with a side of eggs and sausage and while the food was good, I would say personally not spectacular and definitely not worth the long wait. Definitely try it, but not some place I would stay and wait for.

Saturday morning. Arrived at 9:06, seated at 11:13, left at 11:54. After nearly spending THREE hours to have breakfast, we felt full but empty at the same time. The food: Monte Cristo, the best thing on the freaking menu. French toast sampler, the lemon blueberry was the best- next time just ordering the plates of those, the other two on the plate were bland. Washington square omelette, the pepper and sausage had great flavor.North Beach Benedict, the idea of prosciutto on eggs Benny was brilliant but it was chopped up into very small pieces like shredded carrots which made the texture of the delicate prosciutto tough. Coffee is priced per cup apparently which I found strange, but the waitress filled up my cup more than once. The service was great but the wait was a bit outrageous. Total time of THREE HOURS from start to finish... That's a bit extreme.

Everything we ate we loved! We waited an hour and would do it again. We had the Monte Cristo which honestly was the best version of that sandwich I'd ever had, the crab Benedict which was just as outstanding and the French toast! They bake the bread they use for the French toast daily and it works! Try Mamas you won't be disappointed!

Just ate here and the wait is long but omg is it worth it. I had the kugelhopf which was really like regular French toast and hindsight I would've ordered something else BUT my bf ordered the monte cristo, the classic, and boy was it amazing and worth the wait. Hurray for bfs and them letting us eat their food!! So I will definitely come back despite the weight and the Montecristo will be mine!

After reading all the reviews, I was preparing for an 1 hour wait. Luckily, I waited only 30 minutes. Score! Mamas is a small quaint restaurant on the corner across the street from Washington Square Park. Big surprise right?? There are windows around the restaurant giving you a nice view of the square and street/people waiting in line. Great for people watching. After you wait a while while trying to catch Pokemon, you will be asked to enter and order at the register. Make sure you bring cash because only debit cards are accepted if the bill is $15 or more. Afterwards, you'll be seated.Montecristo sandwich - turkey, honey baked ham, cheddar and Gruyere cheese battered in egg, grilled and served with homemade jam. I thought the sandwich itself was okay. I did love how the bread was super soft like a cloud. What really gave the sandwich that flavor was the homemade jam. Holy crap was that jam fantastic!North Beach Benedict - prosciutto and grilled tomato. I like tomatoes, prosciutto, and benedicts, so naturally I'm going to enjoy this entree.

This was such an amazing breakfast to start our day!! Granted we experienced no wait because we got there 30 min early on a Thursday morning and were first in line... glad we had a coffee in hand while we waited! But a line did start to heavily form at about 15 til 8. Ordered quickly. Cash or debit only. Monte Cristo is a MUST, grapefruit mimosa husband got the Blackstone eggs Benedict. Perfect. Got a carrot cake to go and that didn't make it very long in the car ride to Muir Woods. Go here.

Yelp 2017 100 Challenge:2017 Review 16/100Being from LA, I'm used to the hype and waiting for things; but with the amount of hype and waiting- I am that much more expecting of the food and quality.We waited about two hours in line. Once we got inside the small restaurant, the process was unexpected where we got to a counter, order and pay for our food. We got the popular Monte Cristo, pancakes, omelette, and Benedict dishes. Honestly for the price, the food was mediocre. The monte cristo dish was very very good, but the only thing good. For the food and especially the wait, it is not worth it. I would not come here again if I had to wait to pay for overpriced mediocre food.

Disclaimer** - came in a party of two around noon on a Thursday and waited for an hour and a half. YES. It was worth it. I would do it again. 5/5. My cousin, who is a local, recommended this brunch place to me. It was fantastic!!! I will now recommend this place to anyone and everyone who is local or plans on visiting the bay sometime soon!I ordered "Mama's Monte Cristo" which was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. The dish is served with a side of potatoes and some fresh fruit. The grilled (not fried!) French toast-esque sandwich dipped in their homemade jam was truly something else!! If you're like me, brunch is where the money's at because breakfast is much too early and there are way too many things to do when traveling to stop for lunch! I would highly recommend this Monte Cristo sandwich or their other one, "Our Famous Monte Cristo!" --not only is it better than Disneyland's...but it is also approximately $6 cheaper!! (ha ha HA)My friend ordered the Washington Square Omelette with egg whites. Something worth mentioning: it costs a little extra to sub for egg whites. But yoooooooo...the Italian sausage in her omelette was SO flavorful. We initially wanted to share a slice of one of their delicious cakes out on display but were glad that we didn't after our meal. The portions here were perfect for brunch.One more thing to note! They do not accept Credit Cards! However, they do accept Debit Cards with a minimum purchase of $15.10/10 would recommend!!!
