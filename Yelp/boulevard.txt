WHATS UP YELPING YELPERS,My name is Kyle, and while I am fully capable to write a review on the deliciousness that was my Scallop + Risotto creamy, gooey, perfectly cooked indulgence, this post is not about the food at Boulevard. This review is about Gabriella our waitress. She IS an incredible human being. From the warm and authentic greeting to the laughs and sincere space all the while a sound professional in the restaurant realm, my business/life/lunch partner and I ended that meal by embracing Gabriella in a hug. She truly has a gift and this review goes out to your entirety. Gabriella is a BEAMING light to this world and I write these words with immense humility to the dining experience she shaped for us last Friday. Thank you for being you. I would encourage (if she wants to) that the Boulevard team receives a training on customer satisfaction from Gabriella, she crafted a memorable experience at the Boulevard that we are hungry for more, and perhaps some more risotto too.Rock on,Kyle "I would like gnocchi, risotto, scallops and more risotto" Edquist *carb Loading; next week is a salad...

Came here for my birthday dinner. It's actually one of the boy's favorite restaurants. That says a lot because he's totally a Taco Tuesday over bougie fine dining guy. We had reservations at 6pm, arrived around 5:30pm -- table was ready whenever we were but of course, we grabbed drinks at the bar first.Our hostess led us to our table and handed me an envelope that had a Happy Birthday card inside. I've never been to a restaurant that did this -- usually it's just a 'happy birthday!' or dessert on the house, which I rather prefer, but it was a very sweet touch to the dining experience.We ordered:Sea Scallop - really delicious and flavorfulFrutti di Mare Ravioli - not my favorite, a filling was a bit mouth dryingBerkshire Pork Prime Rib Chop - SO BOMB. It's one of their most popular dishes. Literally saw plates and plates of it coming out at the front kitchenLamb T-bone - I'm not sure how I feel about this one. I love the tenderness and flavor of the meat, definitely no gamey taste at all. However, I really didn't like the hummuses it was served with. I tried a bit and I couldn't. I moved the lamb to the side of the dish so it wouldn't touch the hummus.Wish we ordered:Maine Lobster & White Chanterelle Risotto - this had been a huge recommendation from our friends but I don't know how I missed this. Would choose this over the ravioliAngus Filet - would choose this over the lamb t-boneDessert:Butterscotch Pudding - I couldn't stop eating this. I loved loved loved the little truffles, rice crispies, and chocolate marshmallows. Highlight: As much as this makes me sound like a peasant, the bread and butter was so. ridiculously. delicious. Hory Mory. Service: I've been to restaurants with better service. Our server didn't seem to care much for our table and often looked distracted talking to us. Normally, this would have thrown me off but my night was going good for the most part and I didn't particular need anything either.Price point: Yes, it's four $ signs but it's comparably much more worth it than other high end restaurants.

I like to mark every 100th Yelp review of mine with a Michelin-starred establishment. While Boulevard no longer has a star, it's still a solid place to dine, whether for lunch or dinner, and it's a good way to mark my 2400th review. Particularly at lunch, it's not really expensive when compared to more luxe places elsewhere in the West Bay. Salads and other apps are reasonably priced given the portions and ingredients, as are the entrees. Even the more expensive ones at lunch ($30 or over) are bona fide seafood entrees, while the burger is quite reasonably priced for an upscale establishment at $15, and decently hefty and juicy at that.Service is engaging and professional, as befitting a classic, lively restaurant. While the decor and the interior aren't the newest, you can tell that this is a venue that lots of people have enjoyed and still do. A solid experience overall.

My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary last month. It was a wonderful experience.Atmosphere:This place is dimly lit, perfect for a romantic evening. The gentle hum of jazz and other romance-inspiring sounds mask the murmur of voices chatting over their meal.The service:Our server was phenomenal. She was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, and her timing was always perfect with the delivery of each new course.Menu:The wine list is daunting, plenty of options, and a sommelier to answer your every question or pairing curiosity. The food options each sounded amazing; we wanted to choose so much more than just 2 of the entrees! We ordered the duck, steak, and chocolate mousse for dessert. Every single bite left us wanting more! (We left full and satisfied though - it was just THAT delicious). Price point:Our meal for two that included a bottle of wine, appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert rounded out to about 350$ after tip. Definitely a "once-in-a-while" kind of dinner for us, but considering the special occasion it was certainly worth it.

Went there in 2015 for my birthday, it is nice, but small table, crowd space. The environment is ok, food is good, we had steak there. Service was great. Easy to get reservation, which is a plus for downtown. Pretty relaxing.Right next to Bay bridge, beautiful scene.

Boulevard was good! I came across this restaurant while looking on Utrip. After doing a little research about it and looking up photos I thought it would be a good place to try. My husband and I meet up with one of his friends that moved out here 2 years ago. I called and made same day reservations. Our reservations were at 8:15 PM and when we got there we were immediately seated. The staff and waiter was nice.We started our dinner with appetizers. I ordered the Beet Salad. My husband ordered the Spanish Octopus with Calamari, and his friend ordered the Ahi Tuna. The appetizers were the bomb dot com!! Amazing! My salad was so light and refreshing while so good. It had mixed greens, beets (they seemed pickled), walnuts, blue cheese, and vinaigrette dressing. Everything played well together to create a nice flavor and wonderful salad. My husband's appetizer was very good as well. It was Grilled Octopus and Fried Calamari over a small bed of risotto. It was all cooked and seasoned well. A very nice combination. His friend's dish must have been good as well because he cleaned his plate. Lol. Next for our entrees. I ordered the Sole set like the Halibut. This means I ordered the Halibut dish but replaced the Halibut with the Sole. It was Sole over a bed of risotto with Asparagus and mushrooms with a fried mushroom on top. It was very good and light. The Sole was cooked perfectly and tender. The fried mushroom was a nice addition. The asparagus was cooked perfectly as well. An overall good dish. My two only suggestions/complaints for this dish is it could have used a tad more seasoning. Also, the risotto was a little more on the runny side. I like my risotto to be a little thicker. My husband and his friend both ordered the Lamb T-Bone. My husband said the lamb was good. I didn't try this so I don't know but I take his word for it. We ended our dinner with desserts. I ordered the Carrot Cake and my husband's friend ordered a scoop of their Roasted White Chocolate Ice Cream. The Carrot Cake was very good. Light but still had all the hearty goodness like cream cheese frosting, walnuts to add the perfect crunch, and the cinnamon cake itself. My dish was served with a scoop of the Roasted White Chocolate ice cream as well. The ice cream was very good. My dish also had a carrot crisp on top.Overall, Boulevard was good and I would recommend them for others to try. I also really loved the portion of their dishes. Not too small but not too big either. I also liked that I could end my dinner with a nice dessert. I hate going to restaurants and everything is good then you get to dessert and it sucks or their menu options for desserts are lacking. Not the case here.

I finally figured out why this place lost their Michelin star in 2016. This was the worst dining experience in my recent memory. I chose to celebrate both me and mom's birthday here and deeply regret it. The night started off fine, but I will just fast forward as to why this place deserves zero stars.For the main course, we order 2 Kurobuta porkchops and 1 Pacific Corvina Sea Bass. Our server Tim H., misheard us and only brought out 1 porkchop and 1 sea bass, which was fine as we let him know and he placed another order for us. Within 10 minutes, the second pork chop was served. After we cut it open, we realized it was pink and obviously undercooked. We waived Tim down and he took a look at the porkchop and immediately brought it back to the kitchen. He came back and changed our plates and utensils as they have been contaminated. Again, we were understanding about it...mistakes happen. I was hoping he would at the very least address the situation and apologize but NOPE. He continued on without saying a word and pretended as if it did not happen. Just when you think it could not get worse, it did. He had the audacity to bring the same porkchop we cut open 5 minutes ago after shoving it back in the oven for 5 minutes. We were shocked that a restaurant of this caliber would make such a rookie mistake. We all looked at the porkchop and it was unappetizing to say the least. After 5 minutes, Tim saw that we did not touch our food and asked if he should just take it away. I nodded. Even then, NO APOLOGY. Needless to say we were both upset and disappointed. I can't help to think that if I was not a young Asian female, the server would have apologized or at least addressed the situation instead of shoving it under the rug. Negative million stars for this. Even without this fiasco, the food was not amazing nor worth the money to me. There are so many amazing restaurants in San Francisco, I would advise to dine elsewhere. There is a reason they lost their star. Never coming back. EVER.

Food is stellar. Setting is beautiful though loud. Mostly, we were just sort of shocked at the mediocre service ~ slow and disinterested. Slow to take drink orders. Slow to take dinner orders. Slow to bring water. Slow to check on status. Slow to bring bill at the end of the meal. At $100/person minimum, not ideal.

I personally believe that Boulevard should have been placed on a Boulevard and not a street, just kidding. Otherwise, this place was nothing short of perfection.My best friend and I came to San Francisco on a mission. To eat good, and have fun. We wanted to at least go out and have one 'boujee' night on our trip and after looking at several Michelin Star Chef restaurants, we decided on making reservations at Boulevard and we were certainly not disappointed!To start things off, Boulevard has fantastic customer service and such a unique vibe to it. It's a very relaxed yet high end restaurant with beautiful floor tiles and intimate lighting. They also have coat service and bar service while you wait.When my friend and I were seated we were immediately tended to by our waitress who took our drink orders. My best friend was pregnant, so my friend notified our waitress and our waitress made sure all of my friend's food was thoroughly cooked, and even so the food was amazing.We ordered the Scallops for the appetizer, and even though they were fully cooked, they had such a buttery melt in your mouth taste! It was perfectly seasoned, we just had to make every bite worth it. For our entrees I got the medium rare Lamb T Bone, and my friend got the Halibut. The Halibut came with this phenomenal cream sauce. That sauce was no joke. I need a lifetime supply of it so I can smother everything in it the way people obsess Nutella with desserts! And the Lamb T Bone? Don't get me started. My stomach still growls over it. I cleaned the plate! I vacuum sucked that food straight to my stomach. (Just kidding I actually tried really hard to not eat so fast because I wanted to savor every moment)! It was cooked to perfection. You can still see lots of pink which I love, the seasoning was amazing and everything just blended so well. There was a perfect amount of savory to sweet and some starch from the Yukon and some crunch from the veggies. I would have to say that was one of the best plates I've ever eaten. I actually even helped my friend eat all of her food because I couldn't get enough of it!Finally we knew that no matter how full we were, we had to get dessert! We ordered the Peaches and Cream sundae to share which was incredible. Layers of fresh peaches, storm fruit, bruleed Toffee and cake bites. It sounds overly sweet but the tart from the fruits really brought it together. Also I must add that one of the staff members that was cleaning our tables I believe his name was Josef and he said he was from Mexico was super awesome. He was extremely friendly and attentive. He had many customers to work with but still managed to make each one feel special and that is a difficult feature to uphold. Overall, Boulevard wasn't just that one crazy night that my friend and I said "TREAT YO SELF". It was actually very memorable and I think all of the staff had very high standards to make it that way for each and every customer and I applaud that. San Francisco really wasn't my personality, but I would definitely come back just to eat here. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip!

I'm gonna be honest here. To me, everything about Boulevard screamed of... well... oldness. Not necessarily in a bad way though! It's just that this restaurant attracts a more mature crowd, is decorated with aged wooden furniture, and even smells of old money. It's the kind of oldness that's actually cozy and comforting. I would compare it to sitting down in your grandfather's leather couch in front of a red brick fireplace. Imagine that you are also reading a very scholarly book and drinking a glass of Blue Label. Oh, and that you are wearing a monocle as well. Gotta have the monocle.// Sea Scallops ($24) - 4 stars// Chiogga Beets, Cana de Cabra & Hazelnuts ($16) - 3 stars// Brent Wolfe "King" Quail ($39) - 3 stars// Lamb T-Bone ($39) - 4 stars// Kurobuta Pork Chop ($39) - 5 stars// Dark Chocolate Caramel Mousse and Hazelnut Praline 'Tart' ($12) - 4 stars// Butterscotch Pudding ($12) - 5 stars

I came here with 3 coworkers for dinner on a Wednesday night. We were unable to get a suitable reservation for Tuesday night, as they were booked until 9:30. When we called on Tuesday they said they only had openings at 5:30 and 8:45, but we checked again the next morning online, and 8 pm had freed up, so we took that reservation. The restaurant was absolutely beautiful, even more so because it was decorated for the holidays. There really was a very charming ambiance that's hard to capture with words; I just know I loved being there. When we arrived, it took them a few minutes to seat us because they were so packed. We were seated right behind the hostess podium; I would have loved to have gone farther into the restaurant to see more of the decor, but it wasn't too bad where we were. The restaurant was actually quite large and appeared to go really far back, even though it was completely packed. I really had to scoot in since there was so little space between our table and the tables around us. Since the restaurant was so popular it was really, really loud-- it was hard to carry on a conversation.For an appetizer, we got the burrata cheese, which was really tasty. I ordered the steak, while all 3 of my coworkers got the halibut, which they described as melt-in-your-mouth, almost like butter. My steak was tasty and done just as medium rare as I wanted. The potatoes that came with it were so, so good and flavorful; I honestly liked them even better than the steak. We also got a bottle of red wine to share; the server was able to help us pick one from the frankly overwhelming wine list.I didn't pay so I don't know the exact cost of the meal, but my steak was about $50 and the halibuts were about $30-something each. My boss, when paying for the next night's meal at an upscale Italian restaurant, joked that our Boulevard meal was about double the price (although we only got 2 glasses of wine at the Italian place, rather than a whole bottle, which would have contributed to the price). Overall, I'm glad I got to try such a well-reviewed and beautiful restaurant, but the price, crowding, and noise level knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars for me.

I came here for an anniversary dinner and the experience was alright. We had reservations and it took us 30 minutes to get seated, only to get a table right next to the door facing, not the Bay Bridge, but the street parking lot. Food - Some plates were great, others were decent. I hate to be blunt, but I can see why this restaurant no longer has a Michelin star. All in all, the food was good considering the price per plate is not that expensive (Ranging from $20 - $40 per plate).What we ordered:Appetizers -- Dungeness crab - Light and refreshing taste. (4/5)Foie gras - Probably the best foie gras I've had. (5/5)Entrees -- Lamb - For "the best" entree on the menu, I was disappointed. Not too memorable. (3/5)Halibut - The halibut didn't melt in my mouth as I had hoped. The side vegetables were meh. (3/5)Dessert -- Chocolate "Pie" - Don't be deceived, the chocolate pie wasn't really a pie. It was more like three chocolate truffles, with a scoop of ice cream. Pretty average selection. (2/5) Carrot Cake - I love carrot cake, but I never knew how much better carrot cake can get. Hands down, best carrot cake I've had. (5/5)Service - Our waitress was great. She gave us good recommendations and was very personable. However, the service of the bartender and the two hostesses seating us was subpar.

I have been here so many times but realized I never left any notes for myself for the future visits and I think it's time to boil down my dining experience over the years and leave a note for the future me.Ordering appetizers and splitting main course halibut was amazing idea. Foie Gras was nothing specialSoft shell crab was a deep fried mistakeThe truffle tortellini were loved by everyone at the table. The crab meat rolled in the cucumber skin was very delicate.Service was polite and prompt,When I ordered wine he poured the last drops from the bottle with all funk on the bottom.With the price tag, I think it's 3,5 stars for me. But it's not bad.

Food, service and decor were all wonderful. I do have to say that comparably for the price, there may be better restaurants out there - but Boulevard is definitely a great spot for a celebratory dinner. The ambiance is lively, there's great energy and noise but you definitely feel like you can sit and chat for quite some time without feeling rushed. Service is impeccable and our waiter was lovely. I had let the restaurant know ahead of time that it was a going away dinner and the waiter knew exactly what to do, was super helpful such a charming gentleman. The food is delicious but in terms of wow factor, I don't think I was blown away by the dishes and flavors, it felt safe and solid so no complaints, but if you're looking for the extra oomph, I might suggest some other also high quality restaurants in the bay area. Drinks: We tried some of their specialties like the hibiscus moscow mule, cucumber gimlet and dolores swizzle - all great choices and provided an excellent atmosphere to start off and went fine with all our orders. Appetizers: We ordered the sea scallops, as well as the sweet white corn and dungeness crab ravioli for our starters. The scallops were delicious and very flavorful - highly recommend. The ravioli was delicious as well, but smaller in portion than what I expected.Entrees: Halibut with fingerling potatoes, brussel sprouts and lobster mushrooms. This was wonderfully cooked and seasoned but again nothing that will blow your palette away. The Lamb T-Bone was delicious medium rare with eggplant stuffed burrata. tomato and basil (I really enjoyed the stuffed eggplant!) and lastly one of my friends ordered something that was like a pasta dish with truffle and I really cannot remember what it was called, so sorry! Again, everything was tasty, but just didn't blow us away. Desserts: We got the strawberry icecream bonbon which was really yummy! I don't normally like strawberry ice cream, but it was matched so well with the white chocolate hard shell covering it made for a such a scrumptious bite. We also ordered the peach and vanilla tart and it made for a wonderful closer. It wasn't too sweet and topped off the night just right.Overall, great experience, atmosphere, friendly staff - did i mention views of the bay bridge? location is great if you want to walk around along the water, and even stop by the ferry building area after I would say that it's definitely a worthwhile place to visit but set your expectations accordingly! ~chow!

My boyfriend took us here for our anniversary and I was blown away. I consider myself a foodie but I had never heard of Boulevard so when this was our surprise dinner spot, I didn't know what to expect and didn't have a chance to research online or on Yelp. My first impression when walking in was how BEAUTIFUL this restaurant is. It reminded me of some of the Gaudi buildings in Barcelona. It was dim and very romantic with bowtied waiters and well-dressed patrons. I am used to nice restaurants in SF being full of people in jeans but here, everyone was in cocktail dresses and many men were in suits. A felt underdressed in a collared shirt and a pair of grey chinos. I will say that I was wearing heels and the floor, especially next to the kitchen and bathroom, was a bit slippery and I was worried about my heels getting stuck in the tiling so just a warning.Anyways, we were sat for our reservation at a two-top with a great view of the kitchen and were given our menus and the wine list. The wine list at Boulevard was extensive and, to celebrate, we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir (it may have been the cheapest on the menu but shhhh). We were brought bread which was delicious and crusty and proceeded to order our meal. We ate:-Chilled Dungeness Crab ($21)-We shared this appetizer and I loved it. It was light and had a nice tang. It was a good size to share and primed us for our main courses. A wasn't necessarily a fan of the grapefruit in the dish but I definitely think it is worth ordering. It didn't pair well with the wine we ordered but, of course, that's on us and not Boulevard.-Quail ($39)-This was my main and it was delicious and served beautifully. The flavors went well together and it was perfectly comforting on a cold, SF night. It was savory with a touch of sweetness and was perfect. The Quail was cooked really well and I was quite happy.-Kurobuta Pork Chop ($39) - This was A's main and it was HUGE. Easily double the size of mine but he had no issue polishing it off. This was delicious and I couldn't stop sneaking bites. The meat was cooked well and the flavors were cozy. A was very happy with his choice as well.Since we were celebrating, we also ordered dessert even though we didn't *really* need it. We had the Chocolate Silk Cream Pie ($12) which was FANTASTIC. Whoever is the pastry chef at Boulevard deserves Kudos for this delicious dessert. It was rich but the texture was airy. We devoured it in 2 minutes and, if the environment were less fancy, I think we would have wanted to lick the plate. In addition to the wonderful food at Boulevard, the service was great. A lot of nice restaurants have stuffy service but we felt like the service here was friendly and unobtrusive. Our water glasses never were empty and we received a second serving of bread without asking. I think it's a quality of a nice restaurant to have great service where the wait staff reads your mind on what you need.The final bill was pretty reasonable for the restaurant of this calibre considering we had 3 courses and a bottle of wine. Obviously we would never come here for a random meal (too expensive for that) but both of us would love to come back, especially since their menu changes regularly. I don't know why this place lost its Michelin star considering it was a better experience, to me, than other 1-starred restaurants but rest assured, a meal here is a real treat and if you get the chance, it's worth the visit.

Came here recently after a baseball game. It was still early, so we had to wait at the bar for about 30 minutes until the kitchen got going. After a refreshing cocktail it was time to sit at the chef's counter. The restaurant filled up quickly, but the staff was still attentive. It was really interesting watching the 10 or so different staff members cook and assemble the plates. Good harmony and flow for a busy Sunday evening. The FoodOur group shared a the scallops 5/5 and seafood raviolis 4/5 for appetizers. Everyone seemed to enjoy those. I had the salmon 5/5 for my entree and it was fantastic. The others ordered the signature pork chop 3.5/5 , the halibut 4/5 and the lamb tenderloin 5/5 A++. The halibut was great, the lamb was some of the best I've had and I didn't try the pork chop, but my dad said it was on the dry side. That's unfortunate because I really enjoyed it the last time 5/5 eating there and I recommended it to him. He raved about his beet and fig "salad" though, so that was good. Overall, I thought it was Boulevard was excellent. I'll be back if I'm down there

When we lived in the city this was our go to spot. I don't know what all the fuss is about in previous reviews.Make a reservation! They book quick for dinner so get on it! Their menu does change seasonally. If it's a special occasion let them know when you make a reservation.Bar- they have a great little bar area, one hell of a wine menu and they make killer cocktails. We always go here for a drink before dinner.Dinner- food has always been top notch the numerous times we've eaten here. Appetizers are a little small so I'd suggest getting 2 and sharing. They do serve bread w amazing butter and sea salt so don't fill up! I've gotten the filet mignon and duck confit both were outstanding. Their desserts are on another level. Do get the bon bons ... yes I said bon bons. Service- we've always had incredible service. I'm one of those people that thinks you're treated the way you're treating the server ... so be nice and understand that everyone makes mistakes once in awhile even at nice restaurants ... big whoop. Location is great. It's right on the Embarcadero so if you're visiting as for a 2 seater on the bay side. :) Great spot for a fancy night out or special occasion

I was always intrigued by Boulevard's classy and old time-y exterior, so I booked reservations for Mr. Joy's birthday once. It still took a while to get a table. While we waited around the bar, I did some people-watching. The dining area was dimly lit and intricately decorated in somewhat of a French-Louisiana style. Even though we were only a couple of minutes late, we weren't seated until about half an hour later. When we finally sat down, we were definitely ready to eat.Angus Filet - w/ sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes & corn, red peppers, & roasted beef jus:The filet mignon was excellently cooked to a nice medium rare, a little pink on the inside and quite juicy. It seemed a little on the small side. The accoutrements were also tasty.Kurobuta Pork Chop - apple fritto, apple miel poppy seed spaetzle, brussel sprouts, bacon, squash & roasted sage pork jus:Pretty good chop, I'd say. There was a lot going on with the sides, but the flavors seemed a little lost, with the exception of the double smoked bacon, of course. Perhaps I'm not a fan of spaetzle.Dreams Never End Bon Bon - rye whiskey & pear ice cream, almonds & cocoa nib:This dessert was overflowing with sweetness. Mr. Joy enjoys liquor-flavored sweets, but I find them to be too much for liking. The whiskey-flavored mousse was especially strong. The bon bons were the best part for me, because they resembled little bite-sized truffles.The meal ended with a birthday surprise dessert, so we definitely had our fill of sweets. It was a candle in what looked like a serving of semifreddo, accompanied with rolled-up crepe cookies, and a white chocolate rectangle, piped with "Happy Birthday!" It was cool and refreshing compared to the cloyingly sweet previous dessert.Service was excellent. Our server was very friendly, sweet, and chatty, albeit at times, a little too chatty. We left feeling full from the food and full of knowledge about the waitress's life story. Overall, the meal was great. The filet and pork chop were delicious, but I wasn't a big fan of our desserts. Compared to the plethora of dining options around, I didn't find the menu selections very unique or exciting, but that's not exactly an issue since they serve mostly classic dishes.

Hands down on fabulous service, went to Boulevard for a business luncheon; mentioned to the organizer 3 mins before it stated that I'm on dairy free diet. They made my 3-course lunch completely separately DAIRY FREE!! Very impressed and satisfied. #michelinstandard

Lunch Review:Eeek. This place was super disappointing. We ordered two apps and two entrees. Both entrees were underwhelming - one was served cold. For mains we ordered the scallop risotto entree and steak sandwich. Each meal cost $28 and $24 respectively. I could have easily made better food at home...that's not something someone should say eating at a restaurant. The scallop risotto just tasted bad. It was also plated and served with a huge streak of risotto climbing the plate almost to the rim...my dining companion and I looked at each other and laughed. Who expedites, sees this on the plate and thinks "this is ready to be put in-front of a customer". It would have been more funny if I wasn't paying for this meal. Commentary made during the meal:"the apps really were better than the entrees""with food like this I would never gamble on a dinner here""the service is amateurish given the price point""why does this place have the reputation it does given the quality of the food."If there's one thing SF has going for it is that we have a wide selection of decent restaurants. Save yourself the disappointment of this tired place and go somewhere that actually tries to earn your business.

boulevard screams old nyc which is one of the many reasons i love it. the cocktails are well made and the dishes are fantastic- highly recommend the lamb, it completely melts in your mouth. dinging one star, maybe should be more, because i found a hair on my plate and mgmt did not do anything about it!! mgmt if you're reading this contact me - thats just not acceptable for a restaurant at your price point.

There are times where bad service results in an overall terrible experience but this time wasn't it. I was with two others and had dinner on a Saturday night. We ordered the soft shell crab and the tuna tartare as our starters which were both fantastic, then a long delay for the entrees was not the greatest but when we brought to our waitress attention they actually responded like they cared and were great in dealing with the situation. Just a side note - I was a third wheel so I had extra time to analyze every detail of everything. Shoutout to the NBA on TNT guys in the building.

This restaurant is obviously popular and crowded- but it's resting on perhaps undeserved laurels- apps fine - but 3 of 5 of the dinners - lamb- was ice cold-2x!!Very inconsistent and not worthy of the accolades in the earlier reviews.

I met a co-worker for dinner on a Saturday night and as expected it was extremely busy. Service was excellent and the food was very good. The portions are quite small which is why I rated it very good, not outstanding. I felt the value for money was a bit light. I had the lamb. It was excellent, and would order it again. It is still a place very much worth visiting.

This is a very unique classic restaurants that I feel could be featured in a movie. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and located at a corner. Not much valet but that's all of SF too. The food is small in quantity on big dishes just as all rich highly overpriced restaurants do. But thankfully for me that night I wasn't very hungry. There's a lot of wow factors about this restaurant. The view for one side of the restaurant you could see the bridge. The very extra but classy way to go to the restroom via elevator or stairs. The bathroom itself. And some of the food.We had a ravioli mushroom type of appetizer and it literally made me and my boyfriend say wow by the first bite. It was funny cause some person to the left of me did the same reaction to some other dish. Main dishes were good but if that appetizer was bigger in size I'd stick to that.I think the best part about this restaurant is that they have this bread crumb scooper that servers use and it's just so useful and a fun additive to a big establishment.It was our One Year Anniversary and our server gave us a little treat for dessert that celebrated that. Aside from the food being obviously overpriced though it's to be expected for any type of 4+ star restaurant, there were two main issues that made me mad about this place. My boyfriend made a week in advance reservation to be a surprise and sit next to the window with the view, the hostess apologized and said she gave us the closes she could and it was a complete joke of a table. We thought maybe it's because they only allow bigger parties to sit there but not we saw an older white couple sit there later on. Maybe they were more "deserving" of the table. But then our table was sticking out of the corner of this fence they had. I felt like people would've knocked food over David or just run into him cause that was a main passage way. No food was knocked over, but people were hitting him cause we were sticking out. Maybe I'm thinking to much of this, it's possible. But for such a high praised place I expect the best, and it was close but not there.

I heard great things about this place and was very excited to try it. It is a large restaurant down by the water in the financial district. Very romantic setting and this lighting greets you as you enter and take your seat. The kitchen is open and a bar wraps around it. There is an extensive wine list but not much for craft beer fans. When you come here, know that this is not a cheap meal. My husband ordered the Quail and I went with the Halibut. Quail was a hearty dish, filled with winter crops and harvest flavors. My halibut was seared perfectly and it flaked away with barely any pressure of the fork. It was creamy and light served with a Blueberry Jus with Tarragon. I did not get much blueberry flavor at all though which was disappointing. The portion sizes of both dishes were appropriate to finish in one sitting. This place is meant for you to slowly enjoy a meal and lose track of time. For the price though, it may be best to enjoy a small plate or appetizer here and find a different spot for your main meal. Our entrees were good but they were just not that memorable. Compared to some of my favorite spots and the hype I had heard about this place, I left wanting more. It was worth stopping in to see the beauty of the restaurant but not a place I would frequent often.

Finally got to have dinner at Boulevard for the first time last night after years of hearing rave reviews from people I know. Overall, I expected to be more "WOW'd" by the food itself which is why I'm giving this place only 3 stars.SERVICE--Impeccable and fantastic from beginning to end. We originally had reservations at 6:15p but ended up wrapping up our day early so called to see if they could move us up. They accommodated for us to come at 5:30p with no problems. There was not one moment where we felt ignored in this place between our server, the bread guy and whoever else came by to bring our food and drinks. Definitely Michelin quality service from beginning to end. They knew it was my birthday so had a special birthday card for me at the table and added a Happy Birthday chocolate on our dessert with a candle. FOOD--The food was cooked well but both my husband and I found it a bit bland. Maybe we've just been spoiled by all the great food in the Bay Area but I really was expecting to be floored because this place has won so many awards. Everything was cooked to perfection but seasonings were a bit too simple for my taste. Best thing we ate were the scallop appetizers but for $25 for two scallops, we definitely won't be coming back. Salmon was very small portion for the hefty price as well. Pork chop was cooked to perfection and very juicy and flavorful but nothing that would get me to return. Best part of the meal was the dark chocolate pudding we had for dessert. It came with a peanut butterfinger stick and chocolate pop rocks which was something I've never seen before. Overall, the meal was good but unimpressive. For the price, there are other restaurants in San Francisco that I would opt to eat at rather than coming back to this place. Glad I finally got to go and can cross it off of my list of places to try.

This was our first time here after eyeing the place for years. Our expectations were high and Boulevard did not disappoint. Desiree and team delivered great service. We ordered wine by the glass, one Cab Sauvignon and three Zinfandels, all very good. We enjoyed the farm grown abalone appetizer with a sauced green pasta. Mains: the lamb was super delicious (California Lamb T-Bone Wood Oven Roasted, Served Off the Bone - Broken potato with crispy jacket, nuvolina cacio e pepe lambs quarter greens & broccoli romanesco green peppercorn lamb jus). The pork chop (Berkshire Kurobuta Pork Prime Rib Chop Wood Oven Roasted - Calvados mutsu apple fritto, cold pressed apple miel, poppy seed spaetzle, half moon bay brussel sprouts & Edwards Virginia bacon. Deviled red kuri squash & roasted sage pork jus) was very good.We enjoyed a caramel chocolate desert with extra scoops of ice cream to accompany it. Very nice.The weather outside was liquid, it was raining very hard. Still, the place was on a roar.They have a variety of seating arrangements. Our table for two was perfect for us, but we also noticed booths for two where both diners face outward, and a lot of diners were going to private rooms. What do you think?

Tons of hype around this place so was expecting a fantastic meal. The appetizers were great (we had tuna tartare, stuffed squash blossoms, and the artichoke). For lunch, I had the sea bass which was just so-so. My friend had the burger which looked good but he also said it was so-so. Two people in our group had the scallops which looked super good and I heard good things but it was a tiny portion. We also had two desserts, which were pretty good! One was a strawberry thing with a donut like cake on top, the other was a red velvet cheesecake I think? They were both pretty good!All around just a so-so experience. Pretty expensive and not a very extensive menu. If you're in a rush at lunch, this is not the place for you.

Had a leisurely lunch here -- definitely a spot for expense accounts. Started out with the seasonal squash blossoms, deep fried and stuffed. They were actually pretty large enough for a light meal, and were definitely the highlight. Scallops followed - but while they were perfectly cooked, they were underseasoned. This was also the week they had guava lemonade - so I tried that. A bit tart for my taste though, and it seemed to be mostly nectar. If you must have a nice bistro experience but don't want steak frites, and have an expense account, this will do, but I might try something else in the Financial District.

I cannot say how this establishment treated us other than to say the word discrimination comes to mind. My husband was in shorts and instead of saying there was a possible dress code they put bus at a small table in the corner... Put a table cloth and brought silverware after we were there for 20 minutes....then took our order..I had a appetizer of scallops.. For 2 scallops it was 42.00...skip this one and head to the wharf or Chinatown..you'll be treated much better!

Dining alone isn't an activity I'm really accustomed to (although I learned on Friends that it's great and I should do it more often), but I just finished up a solo meal at Boulevard. My dining experience was fantastic. I showed up at 8:30 on a Sunday and the restaurant was basically dead. I pulled up a seat at the bar and the two bartenders immediately got me taken care of. They were both very friendly, and mostly left me to my own devices. When I passed on ordering a drink and opted for water they were completely cool with it which isn't always a given.I ordered a three course meal starting with the Red Abalone. This is something I was completely unfamiliar with but my grandpa who spent a lot of time in SF between deployments in WWII told me I should try to track some down while I'm here. The sauce they were served in was super tasty. I completely cleaned the plate (which is a theme for this meal).The Kurobota Pork Chop was also excellent. It was cooked perfectly. The smoked bacon and brussels sprouts were also great (the parsnip mash was okay, I could have done without it, the pieces weren't evenly cooked). Once again, completely finished the dish.For dessert I had the Chocolate & Caramel. This was basically three separate desserts served together: ice cream, mousse, and devil's food cake. Again everything was fantastic. Finding restaurants like this when I'm visiting places is always a little sad because I know I don't have access to eat at them regularly. Although at the price point that probably wouldn't be an option anyway. It was totally worth the money though.

This is where all the locals go for great fare. After being recommended this place from San Fran's locals we had to try it for our anniversary dinner when visiting San Fran. The service and food did not disappoint. The Art Deco theme brings a fun atmosphere that can either be dressed up or down. We saw people there in suits and dresses to casual clothes just there to get amazing food. Every bit was delectable and the service just made it that much better. I can't wait to visit again.

I guess this is what you call a classic! The food does not disappoint but it is pricey given its Michelin star. I'd heard so much about this place ever since I was born and people rave on and on. Personally, I did not think THAT highly of my food. It was solid and everything was good but not wow-ing. My qualms are that the ambience decor are in dire need of an upgrade! Maybe it's just my taste, but I wouldn't want to bring someone here for a special occasion. Not sure I would come again. So many finer establishments around! I think I should be able to be choosy if I'm paying $$$$ prices.

I learned about Boulevard from reading articles about the best restaurants in San Francisco, and this restaurant was consistently listed as being one of the best. That is why I did some research and discovered that not only does it have a tantalizing high class French food menu, it also has stunning views of the Bay Bridge as it is located near to the Ferry Building. Once I had learned all this information about Boulevard, I was convinced that this is the restaurant where I wanted to celebrate my 22nd birthday.And I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. The decor is upscale vintage with romantic lighting -- as soon as I walked in, I felt like a movie star from the 1960s walking into the lobby of some luxurious hotel. We were seated at a comfortable table that had soft couches and plush seats, and we had a direct view of the Bay Bridge, which looked absolutely stunning that night. The only thing that could rival that beauty was the long dress I had donned for my special day (at least, I like to think so!)Our server was incredibly professional and knowledgeable about the dinner and drinks menu. I wanted some bubbly with my dinner, and he picked out the perfect sparkling wine to go with my meal. The appetizers were really luxurious -- Boulevard likes to use premium ingredients like truffles with their food, I noticed, and we liked one of their truffle appetizers so much that we ended up ordering it again. I had a seafood dish for my entree which came with a squid ink rice pilaf and a mussel with caviar dripping from it, and it was the best seafood dish I've ever had -- and that is a BOLD statement. For dessert, I ordered a glass of pink moscato and bon bons, and the restaurant was kind enough to decorate the plate for my birthday. Our meal came out to be just a little over $100 per person, which is reasonably priced considering we shared several appetizers, had our own entrees, and ordered drinks and desserts. Boulevard is as classy as it gets in San Francisco, and this is a special occasion restaurant I would recommend to anyone who wants to feel glamorous and luxurious for an evening.

For a long time, this place was on my radar along with many other restaurants in SF. I finally decided to go here one day because we were conveniently right at the corner of this restaurant. We ordered:- Soft shell crab = light and crispy with some greens. - Sea Bass = with grilled octopus, risotto, and veggies. Very salty dish.- Lamb = fried blossom squash with pesto sauce. This was our least favorite dish due to the over cooked lamb. Skip the dessert!To wrap things up, the food was just simply bland and boring. Not to mention, OVERPRICED! I feel bad since my friend paid for my meal as always. Eek!As for the service, I agree with many of my fellow yelpers that they need to lose the attitudes. KTHANKSBYE!

Michelin star restaurant never fails shine!I was quite apprehensive on coming here for lunch as I imagined long lines and long wait time given how busy this place usually is. The first question the asked when I sat there was if I had any time restrictions. I said I hope to be done within the hour. No Problem he said.I got the wagyu beef, which got my pallets wagging non stop for more. The beef was so tender and melted in my mouth. The reduction sauce was just perfect, not too salty and not too overwhelming.Ambiance and service was top notch.

This was one of the better meals in my life! We came because it was very close to our hotel on the embarcadero and has a Michelin star. With reservations me and my gf were seated right away under a beautiful ceiling in a massive booth. My drink was the strawberry lemonade with vodka, amazing. Simple but I would come back just for that. We had a tasty grilled octopus app, it was perry good. The star of the meal was my pork chop recommend by the waiter. One of the best things I've ever had. Please get this. My gf had halibut which was nice and light. Deserts were top notch. I got some chocolate pudding I really liked. For a 100$ per person meal I expect very very good food and service and decor and this certainly met if not exceeded that criteria.

Ok, first the good. The halibut was actually awesome. And the wine list has some good stuff on it. And in general, I really like the vibe of the dining room. It is warm and nice with great privacy per table. But in general I would say the food was pretty disappointing. Really great presentation on everything but I would say most dishes were not good. Not actively bad, but not good. And the cocktails were similarly unimpressive. I really want to like this place as I enjoy the atmosphere and there are not a lot of dining rooms like this in sf. But there is so much better food elsewhere that I think it is a pass.

Decided to come here short notice on a Thursday evening. We were able to walk in without waiting and were seated at the Chef's counter. We made it just in time to beat a middle-aged, statuess... Impatient couple to a table. It was about 7:30-8pm and the place was busy and lively, full of older distinguished couples enjoying their mid week date and sipping on wine. The ambiance is very cozy and warm feeling; it felt like Christmas to me when we walked in.I was so happy that we were seated at the chef's counter because we got the chance to watch the chef's prepare, cook, and plate the food. Very organized, non-stop work these people. You can see the hard work and care and concentration in the food that they put out. We were given a complimentary zucchini bread for taste and it was light and cleansing, easy on the palate. We ordered an appetizer of the foie gras. I can NEVER pass this up if it's on the menu. It was served with a sweet persimmon and whole wheat sourdough. Which the serving of foie gras was more generous (who doesn't, honestly) but I've had better foie gras elsewhere. I ordered the filet mignon with polenta done rare and it was cooked perfectly. Tender, red center, warm, and juicy. The spinach and polenta meshed perfectly.My boyfriend ordered the pork. I had a bite of the prime rib pork chop which was very thick and juicy. He LOVED it.I had asked the waitress to recommend a wine for me, I have a preference for sweet reds. I have a very sweet tooth. She suggested a I think it was a boulase? The downside of dessert wines, they are only 2 oz. pours. It wasn't my first pick but I wish she could have recommended something better. Well can't really blame her, not everyone is a sommelier or has a specially in wine selection. Man, I wish they had a Canadian ice wine on their menu. All in all. I love the ambiance. The service as good, we may have waited a little longer than usual I feel for our food to come but still came out in a timely enough manner. The presentation of the food was beautiful, like art on a white canvas. Finally, the taste was good, with top quality preparation.
