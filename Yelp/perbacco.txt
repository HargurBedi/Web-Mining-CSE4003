Came here with my cousins for one last meal before one of them heads back home to Hawaii. I guess we came a bit too early because the full menu was not yet available. The hostess informed us that it was happy hour if we wanted to sit by the bar. She said they had some food available, so we figured we would go give it a go.The hostess was not very friendly or inviting. Her demeanor made me want to turn around and eat next door, but I knew my cousin wanted to try this place. She's the one visiting, so what she want is what she gets. Our waiter on the otherhand was very friendly and attentive. He was always there when we needed him, and he often checked up on us to see if we needed refills on water or more drinks. The menu was VERY LIMITED. Our waiter then came to tell us that the shishito peppers were not available, so we ordered all four of the items on the menu. Everything we thought we would enjoy at least. We shared family style, so nothing became over whelming in taste.Stuff grilled squid- Pretty good. There aren't many places that make a dish like this, so I appreciate it when I can get it. Chicken wings- It was okay. It was very saucy. A little bit too sweet and zesty for my liking. It was accompanied by a spicy mayo like sauce, but I felt that the wings already had enough sauce- if not too much.Agnolotti dal plin- Very interesting. It was a bit dry on the inside. Perhaps it needed a little more sauce. Tajarin- I enjoyed this a little bit more than the other pasta dish. It was more flavorful all around. I liked that it was not as heavy or filling as it looked. Complimentary hazelnut meringue- Good! I love that it was very light in taste, a bit airy, but not too sweet. It had nuts in almost every bit. I love nuts!I really wish we would have been able to try food from the full menu. I heard that they have really good halibut and risotto. That just means that I have to go back and give it another try! Can't say the same for my cousin, she won't be able to try it until her next visit to SF.

Really loved the food here. Stumbled in and spent more than we wanted but it was worth it. Really nice evening out for a special occasion.The heirloom tomato and watermelon salad was delightful and perfect compliment to heavy mushroom soup. We also tried the cannelloni made from polenta, which was really innovative but maybe less flavorful than it could have been.Absolutely LOVED the Greco wine... it's a unique wine selection that has a slightly salty or oceanic aftertaste - ie it's like the wine version of Islay scotch.The frangipane tart for dessert was really the standout. Amazing. We also tried the lemon verbena panna Cotta but it wasn't as nearly as good as the frangipane.

TL;DR Great service and some pretty good pastaI came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. The food was great, the service was great, the company was great! We got a bunch of dishes, but the duck pasta was the best! All pasta is made fresh in house. They also have a large wine menu. Helen, our server was funny and awesome + gave us desserts on the house. We had the ugly cookies, but those ugly cookies were yummy and sweet!Perbacco is in downtown SF, so walking/public transportation is your best bet.

Great Italian food! My friends and I wanted to try this place in SF as recommended by a friend. Steve (manager) and staffs were excellent with service and food recommendations. Their pasta was amazing. What I like about their menu is there is an option for small portions for pasta which allowed us to try a variety of food. Their appetizers, squid ink pasta, and dry aged duck breast was amazing! Price is reasonable and portions are big. I recommend checking this place out if you are in SF!

This is a great place for dinner. Delicious pasta. The squid ink pasta is a must try (with lobster jus... to die for). Ordered tons of appetizers, two pastas, risotto, the duck breast, and beef short ribs to share. Five of us were completely stuffed afterwards. Treated a friend for her birthday. Split the bill four-ways and it came out to less than $100 per person after tax and tip. Not bad, consider a meal at Michael Mina on the same block would have been more than $100 with tax and tip. Would definitely come back.

Based on other yelp reviews and pictures I decided the pasta looked amazing here and needed to try! Was definitely not disappointed. I got the squid Ink pasta and my boyfriend got the tagliatelle with short rib ragu. Both were delicious! And super filling! They give you bread with your pasta dish too to soak up all the goodness! Service was great and it was busy! My only thing was how tight our seating was but I not out of ordinary that some restaurants do. Great time! Will be back again!

Healthy portions, reasonable pricing, a fantastic ambience, and to top it all off... the best handmade stuffed pasta I've ever had. We came on the Friday to kickoff Memorial Day weekend, and the place was surprisingly not packed (FiDi workers leaving town I suppose). We were quickly seated at a booth and our hostess struck up conversation while we waited beforehand. The inside of the restaurant is spacious and doesn't feel like you're jam packed with the other tables. It's always nice when San Francisco restaurants actually let you hear the person across from you, and somehow maintain reasonable prices.Our waiter gave some great recommendations, and overall provided phenomenal service. They brought some interesting pocky-like crackers with salsa to start, then bread and butter to follow (complimentary of course). I ordered the Agnolotti and my lady ordered the gnocchi. The gnocchi was good, but the Agnolotti was absolutely outstanding. Far and above the best stuffed pasta I've ever had.Basically, it's a three dimensional triangle stuffed with a delicious mix of pork, quail, rabbit, and veal that is bursting with flavor. Typically stuffed pastas have weak portions, but this plate was literally filled with little stuffed dumplings. The pasta is decadent, with the overflow juice from the meat stuffing serves as the sauce for the dish. The handmade pasta gives it a slightly al dente bite which creates a phenomenal texture. All this for a $22-23 price tag for an entree? Pretty unreal if you ask me.

3.5 StarsDinner for two without reservation that night seem to workout perfectly. We ordered the following:- Pesce crudo $16 = citrus cured salmon with avocado, blood orange, and hearts of palm.- Pappardelle $17 = wide pasta ribbons with slow cooked short rib.- Lobster risotto $17 = small amount of lobster and parmigiano reggiano.The service was good and very attentive. However, the food was okay, but not great. Everything we ordered didn't "wow" us, rather kind of underwhelmed.

Mehhhhhh. Won't be back. Three stars only because the service was good. The food was definitely lacking, though. Ordered the potato gnocchi, pappardelle, and some asparagus/cheese appetizer. Best was gnocchi, but even that was pretty standard. The pappardelle was so mediocre :( it was salty and the the soy sauce like flavor to it was too over powering for the dish. Mind you- Italian is my favorite and I usually LOVE pappardelle dishes. The noodle was slightly hard as well. At the end of the meal, both my boyfriend and I kind of looked at each other like "ehhhh =\". The ambience was really romantic.. dimly lit environment and good service. Aside from that, the food was nothin special.

Perbacco really made my birthday feel so special. They had a birthday card waiting for me at the table. They took care of the balloons that my friend had waiting for me when I walked in and took care of the cake she brought as well. They even gave me a special birthday dessert! Such a nice touch! Service was great! She was very attentive and super nice!!Food wise we ordered:Fritto MistoCarne CrudaLittle Gem saladPappardelleGnocchiand a fish item, forgot the name, oops.Side of brussel sprouts Everything was really good. The sauces on both pastas were flavorful. The pasta dishes aren't huge but everything is very filling.

Ok this restaurant has some of the best Italian dishes from this side of the Atlantic ocean. However, the desert was just such a turn off. It is so unsavory to the point if we ever decide to go back (desert is pretty important to cap off a great meal). we might need to go to another restaurant afterwards for that purpose!I wish I can give this restaurant a 3 and 1/2 stars because there were so many high moments throughout our Anniversary meal:*The pasta dishes and the slow cooked short ribs were fantastic*Ambience is a bit on the conservative side*Price is really great for the quality & portion of the food served*Our server tried really hard although he was a bit of stiff and stern*And the dreadful desert left us looking for another desert spot Just to clarify, the deserts were bland tasting and had a card board texture. We are so torn because we loved the main courses so much but we are so unsure whether we would revisit this restaurant due to the things I've shared above :-(

They were able to accommodate a last minute lunch reservation for a large group. The atmosphere is upscale and the service is attentive.For appetizers we shared the burrata cheese ($16), local mozzarella ($15), and squid ($14) which were all good. For my main dish I got the coujette ($21) which was gnocchi in a marinara type sauce with cheese. It was tasty but I thought the standout dish which someone in my group got was the langaroli which was folded pasta with short rib and black truffle butter. The truffle flavor was really strong. I loved it!Overall nice Italian place to celebrate a special occasion and great for large groups.

Went there for date night and had a 9p Saturday reservation. Walked in at 855 and was seated immediately. Way cool. Nice yellowfin tuna appetizer followed by delicious scallops and a to-die-for braised short rib dish. Side of brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes sealed dinner. Desert options werent the best - could have used more chocolate!Service was top notch. Only complaint: table of 3 men and 1 woman was obnoxiously loud. Expected our waitress to say something to them but she laughed along with them! F bombs, C bombs, generally talking at higher than expected volumes and nothing was done. That tarnished a generally great experience. I like a good time but not at the expense of other guests.

Everything we had here was good. - Scallop crudo = 3/5 stars. Lowlight of the night- Gnocchi = 4/5 stars and pairs well with the next item- Sunchokes = 4/5 stars- Pear 3 ways with Gorgonzola = 3.8/5 the blue cheese is high quality. The uncooked pear was so-so.- 20 Rows cabernet = 5/5 for the price, it's so versatile. Went well with everything. - Service = 5/5 Our server was top notch and on top of his game even though he was busy and didn't bring our water and bread for a long while...- Table bread roll = 2.5/5 these plain cold rolls really don't belong in a restaurant of the level.

Had a great pasta and duck at this place. Most of all, customer service was fantastic. I believe we were served by 5 different people and all of them are attentive. A plastic wrap was accidentally left in our appetizer plate, when I told the server about it, he apologized and offered if we want to return and be served a new one. I said, it's fine, I just want to let them know. When he returned he said he took it off our tab. I think that was nice. The food quality wasn't really affected by the misplaced wrapper. At the end of out meal we were given free desserts because of the incident, I didn't expect that but it only shows how they value customer service. The food was delicious and our cocktails were unique and refreshing. It was such a nice experience dining with Perbacco.

My future hubby and I came here with another couple to taste out their food and to check out the place - planning on renting out a private area for our upcoming wedding reception and we all agreed, this place is it! The dining experience we had here was fantastic! The dishes we ordered were delicious (besides the pork chop) and service was great, much better than the service we received at Gary Danko... Only complaints - hostess could have done a little more smiling and a little better communication when we asked for help. And it was a bit dim inside, found several people pulling out their phones to use the flashlight. Parking might be an issue especially during the day, but they do have valet parking for $10. Much better than the $5/15mins - $33 all day parking lot across the street from them.

I don't know what happened with Perbacco over the years but I had such a disappointing experience there last night it saddens me to reflect on it. It was also embarrassing, as my colleagues from SoCal had relied on me to select a spot for our work dinner as the one who has lived in SF.Suggested Perbacco since it was close to the office we were working out of. Booking for a table of 12 was more of a headache than we thought it would be which already left a bad taste in our mouths. First they were pushy about us booking the private room; when we requested the main dining room they made it seem like it would be a huge ordeal...finally the manager relented and said we could have a 6pm reservation but asked us to come 15 min early, then at 6pm on the dot started calling for status updates (we arrived at 6:02pm). I'm sorry, it's Wednesday, early, and you are not the hottest restaurant in SF, you just happened to be convenient location-wise.The meal was decent, not amazing by any means given the plethora of incredible Italian places in the SF area (desserts were probably the highlight). Reasonably-priced when all was said and done (for the large group that we were). But the service...it wasn't horrible it was just straight BIZARRE.Felt amateur for what you'd expect. Super disjointed...our server didn't seem to be able to multi-task. She would literally recoil as a sommelier was pouring our wine, as if she couldn't continue rattling off her spiel while we were being poured ("Maybe it's an internal house rule?" we wondered.) I was offered a taste by someone else from a bottle I ordered- every other glass was filled but he didn't finish pouring mine after the taste so I had to chase someone down to finish. Several clients we were entertaining had empty glasses and I had to flag someone down to get our server to offer another round. (In a corporate dinner like that, should be easy money just to keep those drinks flowing). When our server caught wind of our anxiousness, was passive aggressive to me with her disdain: "Is there ANYTHING else I can get you? Are you sure?" smiling through gritted teeth then continuously refilled my glass of wine (2 refills within 5 minutes) even though I was slowly sipping.Afterwards I felt everyone was underwhelmed and just not blown away by any means by the ambiance, the service, the food. 2 stars at best. (Barbacco has a better vibe. Then again that was years ago so who knows.)

Updated review
UPDATE: I finally made it here for a "normal" dinner (see below for my review of their special Passover dinner).I came for a work dinner in a group of 7. Service was alright; the waiter was oddly hover-y when we sat down and were clearly in the middle of a discussion and thus not ready to order, but hard to get ahold of later in the evening when we needed him. Nice guy overall though.Anyway, we shared a bunch of appetizers:- PESCE CRUDO: Fantastic. Highly recommended.- BURRATA: Very good!- LITTLE GEMS SALAD (endive and pears): Good, but not as memorable as the others.- STONE FRUIT, TOMATO, AND PARMASEAN SALAD: Great combination! - BEETS WITH YOGURT: beautiful and yummy. For my main course, I got two "half size" pastas - I love that you can order half a portion! In theory it's so you can get one as an appetizer, but it's also great if you want a lighter meal... Or want to try more than one pasta! I got the:- RAVIORA filled with ricotta and lemon, and served in a truffle sauce: AMAZING. Wow. Definitely some of the best pasta I've ever had!- PAPPARDELLE with braised short rib ragu - Also very good, but not as good as the raviora. All their desserts sound amazing, but after consulting with our waiter, I settled on the LAVENDER BAR, which was delicious. It's basically a small layered mousse/cake that's covered in chocolate, and served cut in half on its side. It was a perfect way to end the night!(Below: Passover 2016 review)--------Came here for the Italian Passover special menu last week (see photo), which was a lot of fun. I loved how they had specialty Passover-themed cocktails (which didn't taste all that special/unique, but it's such a great concept).The food itself ranged from hits to misses, but overall was good. I loved the charoset that they served with matza when we sat down - lots of dates, very Sephardic. The antipasti and the soups were also delicious, particularly the chopped duck liver (amazing), the sweet and sour eggplant (couldn't get enough), and the chicken dumping soup, which looked like matza ball soup but actually had chicken and apple meatballs (delicious - might have to copy this for our own Passover next year...).However, the main dishes were totally unmemorable, and the side of broccoli rabe, well, let's just say they took the idea of having bitter herbs at Passover much too seriously. The dessert was good, but super small. Also, I didn't appreciate that our waitress had no idea how to pronounce many of the dishes. I get that this was a special, two day only menu, but it really detracted from the experience, and made it seem much less authentic.Overall, though, we enjoyed the night, and I love that they went out of their way to create such a special and unique (in San Francisco) menu to celebrate Passover. It was a lot of fun.

Came in here for lunch yesterday with a few coworkers and my bosses.We were seated immediately in the upstairs section, but the restaurant was actually pretty packed.We started off with the Pesce Crudo and Fritto Misto for appetizers.I'm not a fan of cucumber or radish, but I was able to eat the Pesce Crudo without any issues, it was good, but I would prefer a tuna tartar.The Fritto Misto is pretty much battered deep fried veggies and a few shrimp with a side of mayo. It's actually pretty simple, but made for a good appetizer. It didn't seem like many of us like olives, but I love them!For my main, I got the Piastra Roasted Chicken Breast, which I have ordered once before. I guess I wasn't feeling adventurous yesterday, but I ordered this dish because I had a good experience with it a few years ago.My coworkers and bosses got the Subrich (meatballs), and Semolina Dusted Petrale Sole. I didn't get a taste of their meals, but they seemed to enjoy it.As for my chicken, it was cooked perfectly! It had the right amount of crisp on the skin, it wasn't dry, and the green garlic-herb jus made a perfect light sauce. Portions of my chicken I felt was a bit small, but with the appetizers I felt I had the right amount of food.We went to order a few desserts for the table; the Malted Dark Chocolate Ganache and the Stonefruit Gelato.Although I liked the texture of the chocolate, I don't think I would get it again. The big piece in the center looked more like a milk chocolate (which is what I prefer), but had the taste of dark chocolate. Sorry, I'm just not a dark chocolate person.The Stonefruit Gelato was absolutely amazing! It's extremely hard for me to describe this one as I haven't had a gelato like this before. You'll just have to give it a try!Overall service wasn't terrible, but there was a lot of waiting in between orders. We intended to finish within an 1hr15mins, but from entering the door and leaving, it took about 1hr45mins.This probably isn't somewhere I would come by myself, but it makes for a nice business lunch/dinner spot, or somewhere to take a date.If you're looking for something more casual, go next door to Barbacco, Perbacco's sister restaurant.

I couldn't say enough good things about this place! The food was absolutely AMAZING! The service was right behind being even more Amazing!I flew in from Austin the evening b4 to celebrate my Son's 20th birthday. It was a very last minute trip. That evening I called around trying to organize him a last minute party for the next evening and no one was willing to do anything special on short notice. I hit pay dirt when I called Umberto the owner of Perbacco.He was absolutely lovely to work with and extremely accommodating. Umberto quickly helped me decide on a fixed menu (keeping it within my budget) and wine list. He put together a beautiful table next day for my group of 15. When we got there, he had a birthday card waiting for my son, and personalized menus for each guest all done very classily! He came by our table numerous times to make sure we had everything we needed and the waiter assigned to us was very attentive too. All our guests (locals who had never been there) were super impressed and they will all definitely be going back to Perbacco. Kudos to you Mr. Umberto for making a fantastic memory for my 20 yr old! I'll be coming here for a meal the next time in to SFO for sure!Love, Love, Love this place!

Overall, I thought it was a decent place but, the food definitely wasn't worth the price.Pros:- They had a fair amount of vegetarian entrees which is great (sometimes hard to find in higher-end restaurants).- A fan of the ambience. The place was lively (visited at lunchtime on a weekday), but each of the tables were a bit secluded from each other, so it offered a good deal of privacy. Cons:- Ordered their tomato basil gnocchi entree. To be honest it was very average. I've heard the Plin Al Funghi is better, so perhaps a bad selection on my bad part.

A fine experience at yet another excellent San Francisco restaurant. Service began with breadsticks and a small ramekin filled with a slightly spicy pesto for dipping. We then ordered a carafe of a house-recommended medium-bodied red wine from Umbria. Unfortunately, we don't recall the varietal or the name, as we arrived having already quaffed a few and were in the "wine-yes" phase, but it was tasty. For dinner we started with Mozzarella di Bufala - small half-rounds of characteristically mild, locally-produced cheese served with strawberries. Our main courses were slices of duck breast tender enough to cut with a butter knife and a unique dish called langaroli - thick pasta noodles folded and stuffed with braised short ribs and black truffle butter. It was all delicious. We saved room for dessert, allegedly. We ordered burnt caramel gelato and something called Duo Di Bonet - white and milk chocolate with meringue and roasted cherries. No complaints. We'd like to make brief shout-out to the service staff. We were initially seated next to a very loud and sloppy four-top; what seemed like married men and women but not to each other. Interesting. But the noise level was the problem. So the floor manager didn't hesitate in moving us to a quieter section upstairs, and we enjoyed being served by a skilled young man named Ben. Perbacco is highly recommended. We'll be back.

Had a decent experience here last night. Ordered apps and wine. Felt a little pressure to order entrees, but we stuck to our guns. We ordered veal and yellowfin tuna tartare. The veal was delicious, but the tuna was very average. We also had the sunchokes, pappardelle and octopus. The sunchokes were pretty delicious, the pappardelle wasn't (though it SOUNDED great) and the octopus was pretty good, not amazeballs. The wine I chose was okay, and at least the most expensive red was only $10 a glass. Service was decent, but a special thank you to the server, Jamie, who found my friend's Burberry scarf and had it sent to our hotel (our hotel made the reservation for us, it took me a while to figure out how they knew where we were staying). Overall, pretty good. Maybe we should've tried an entree...?

HAD TO MOVE MY REVIEW OVER FROM BARBACCO HEHEI got the Lango----something! The short rib pasta and it was AMAZING. They were little pillows of happiness exploding with savory and just the right amount of saltiness. I loved the sauce and asked for bread just to soak it all up.Portion size - GET THE LARGE. Unless you are NOT hungry, just get the large. The waiter kept doubting me saying I wouldn't finish it and I am SOOO GLAD I didn't listen to her! She kept telling my date that he would have to help me. Beef tartare - Also very noms! I always like to try beef tartare everywhere I go and it did NOT disappoint here!!Service - Except for the part where the waitress kept doubting that I could finish my food, everything was great. I will be back fo SHO.

After my birthday dinner, my BFF took me here for dessert in April 2016 (because we enjoy variety, and I'm very particular). I ordered a chocolate dessert at first, but then decided I wasn't in love. I envied his beautiful and delicious strawberry dessert, so we swapped mine out. :)

Updated review
Let me start to say - I love Perbacco, and that is why writing this review is difficult to write.I often bring work colleagues and clients for lunch to Perbacco - the food is consistently amazing and the service discrete but attentive.I took 4 people for lunch today and had a wonderful lunch - at the end of the meal we all surprisingly decided to go for a glass of port. I ordered the table 4 glasses of Tawny Port 20 years old ($20 per glass), this took over 20 minutes to arrive at the table which was surprising as our table was next to the bar and we were one of the few tables still occupied in the restaurant. One of guests who loves port commented it was not a 20 year port but much younger - as I'm not a port expert I thought I'd ask to see the bottle to show my guest. I asked our waiter if he could bring us the bottle and some 20minutes later he appeared with an empty port bottle - a 20 year Tawny port. I asked why it took so long to reach over the bar and how come it was empty - there was no response. The bottle had been washed out so I could not show my guest that what we were drinking was really a Tawny 20, and the restaurant had no other bottles.........it all seemed very fishy and we all felt we had been served a sub-standard drink and not what we had ordered. This may all sound snobbish but at $20 a glass I think a wonderful restaurant of this caliber could have managed this situation far better...... I left with a $340 bill feeling like I'd been ripped off and taken advantage of. Will I return? Sadly I feel the spell of Perbacco has been broken......UPDATE*******i received a call from the owner - a lovely gentleman - who explained the mix up with the port and very graciously apologized. I made a lunch reservation and took a client to Perbacco that week and was warmly greeted by the owner. We were also treated to a complimentary and delicious appetizer! The magic is back!

My boyfriend made a reservation here for my 22nd birthday, overall experience here was lovely. Ambience was definitely nice although oddly incredibly noisy, not sure if due to construction of the place or if ambient music resulted in patrons speaking even louder to hear each other. We were seated in a nice corner area and the server was still very attentive and patient despite our indecision. The foie gras terrine was definitely the highlight of our meal, we were quite sad when we finished it. She recommended a nice Italian red that we did enjoy (know absolutely nothing about European wines, but we expressed partiality to dry cabs and she helped us along). The one negative is that our server did keep correcting my pronunciation of various dishes (granted I am not French) but that was awkward, and even more confusing when the male server bringing us the food (who seemed very much European and possibly French) pronounced it the same way I did. The duck was arguably better than the short rib but both were satisfactory, and both had a sauce pairing that was absolutely amazing. They were oh so sweet and sent along complimentary Italian almond cookies (almost like a meringue but denser) with a "happy birthday" note with it, and the persimmon sorbet was absolutely light, refreshing and delicious. Would love to come back here next time and try their pate and cheese selection.

Great food! great ambiance! What else does one need for a perfect dinner? Our waiter was very attentive and even suggested we order less than what we had in mind reminding us that the portion sizes are pretty generous, which is true. We tried their mushroom risotto, and a couple of pastas. Even though we felt stuffed half-way through our meal, we kept going and eventually emptied our plates because the flavors were right on.

Came here for an anniversary and I will say that the restaurant went out of their way to honor that by having a handwritten Happy Anniversary card ready by the time we sat down and a special treat at the end of the meal. We had an 8:30 pm reservation and wet seated promptly. The food was good, but nothing memorable. We had the shrimp dish as an appetizer, and although it was good, it was messy. The presentation was poorly done and overloaded with fried onion rings. My girlfriend had the appetizer sized rib eye pasta dish. It was good and got the job done. I had the pork chops and they were definitely not to my satisfaction. I was never asked how I would like my pork chops cooked and I was unimpressed with how much effort it took to chew and eat. Atmosphere-wise was good. We had a nice corner table, perfect for people watching. The Server was very helpful and there was a vast wine selection. Lots of great food selections in San Francisco I will try all the other before I return here. Overall I would rate 3.5/5. PS, great ambience.

Nice selection of wines and really good pasta dishes, but the ambiance is a bit more on the older side.

Wow! The food was SO good here - so glad we were able to get last minute resos to Perbacco.The pasta here is really, really good - and they come in small or dinner portions so if you're not feeling too hungry, you can still have a taste. I had the Agnolotti (YUM) while others at the table had the Gnocchi, Shortrib Pappardelle, and Risotto. For starters, I had the Peach and Mushroom appetizer and wow - I could have had two more plates of that.Great wine selection, including some glasses that you can try through the Corovin method. This is a neat contraption where a slim microscopic needle pierces the cork and allows the wine to drain through - such that the cork is never removed ensuring constant freshness of the wine. It's pricey starting with the one I had at $25 but boy it was good.Service was amazing - my husband had ordered a side of Brussel sprouts and when asked about it, the waiter apologized profusely and said he misunderstood and didn't catch it. We decided not to get it even though he said it would only take a few minutes. We still said no (not maliciously but we were happy with ou plates). Our waiter still brought it out complimentary. That was really great.Desserts are also good, but the main features at Perbacco really are the pastas.Great space: modern, sleek, and actually quite large (two floors). I think Perbacco is one of the restaurants to eat in SF, and undoubtedly so! 5 star in my books and the best restaurant I tried while in SF.

Terrible vibe here. From the moment we walked in... we felt an uptight vibe. This place takes itself way too seriously. The food is just alright. Honestly, I felt uncomfortable here. We've been to better restaurants in SF (like award-winning, Michelin star type of restaurants) that are way better and even more expensive than this place and not felt the uncomfortable, disgusting feeling we felt here at Perbacco. We won't be back. I don't recommend this place.

Went here on Saturday night-- made reservations for 2. Host greeted us warmly, took our coats, and were escorted to our table. The wine som helped us pick out the right bottle of wine-- went through a few tastings and ended up with a Montepulciano. We ordered the burrata, gnocchi with pesto and mushrooms, and braised short ribs. Food was delicious. Fresh, well cooked, and flavorful. We ordered the chocolate ganache for dessert-- hubby loved it, super super dense and rich/creamy. It balanced nicely though with some orange peels and peanuts, and other goodies on the plate, but still a lot of pure chocolate for me.Service was fabulous-- friendly, witty, and comfortable. Overall, a great experience.

The decor, service and location were nice. But if you want food that's bland and without much taste, then this is definitely the place for you. We ordered the squid appetizer with the sole and papardelle entrees and while the portion sizes were large and the prices more than fair, adding salt and more salt did nothing to fix the lack of flavor.

Excellent and attentive service without being overwhelming. Food arrives out fairly quickly even for having a packed house. And their pasta lunch portions are extremely hearty! The only complaint is that their Coujette was a bit under seasoned.

This is a 41/2 star restaurant.Seems to be a popular birthday spot. I also was taken their for birthday. Their was a card on the table - honestly, though, people signing a card for someone they don't know?Had the Loves Me/Loves Me Not cocktail and loved it. All the others looked powerful and I wanted a buzz, not getting knocked onto my can.My friend, who has been there before, recommended the mozzarella di bufala. Good choice, the cheese was good and tomatoes ripe. Enough to take the edge off without stuffing us. They brought rolls. Roll was very good but I did not ask for another as I did not want to fill up on bread. My friend got halibut. I thought of scallops, I have not had scallops in an age, but when I asked if it was a cream-based sauce the waiter got a little evasive, well, not really a lot of cream blah blah. I got quail. Very good quail. Crisp skin, interior perfectly cooked, with a corn dish and roasted mushrooms. Everything good and very attractively presented.For dessert got boccone dolce. They wrote "happy birthday" on my plate in chocolate but the dessert was a little disappointing. It looked beautiful but just did not seem to bring out the flavors. The crema had no chocolate flavor and even the ganache had very little. Could they have skimped on chocolate? Seemed unlike them.I also had to ask to bring sugar for my tea, should be automatic, after having to ask twice for them to bring the tea. So they lose a half star.But I'll probably return someday. Try the duck or halibut - both looked good.

Food, drink and ambience mixed together for a wonderful evening. My wife had the pork chop and I had pasta "pappardelle w ragu alla bolognese". We each shared the two dishes to maximize our experience. The serving size was just right and although a little pricy, it was worth it in our opinion. Umberto, and Leslie are delightful.

I ate here a while back I have to say that it was a great first for what I would consider a more fancy restaurant date. The food my girlfriend and I shared for $100 left us very full and fascinated with what we just ate. The ambiance of the place was wonderful. It had a very relaxing vibe to it all. On the day that I went, it was even more relaxing as the restaurant is much less crowded for lunch that I would assume it would be for dinner, leaving me and my date room and quiet to talk and enjoy the food in the surprisingly blissful privacy their table had to offer.

Dined at Perbacco on (2/9/16) and was really impressed with their lunch service. A relatively swanky stop for a Tuesday afternoon, it was packed full of the FiDi crowd and people were in/out quickly. Their ability to get people seated and fed so quickly is truly a feat not meant for many restaurants in the area. It's a great stop for a business meeting and the pricing is super fair for the area. I didn't want to break out my phone to take pictures because I was chatting with a mentor and didn't want to be "that guy", but I will say the food was def photo worthy. I had the dover sole, beet salad, and we split the oxtail tagliatelle. All were very impressive. The only reason I'm holding it to 4 stars is because I want to come back for dinner and be wowed! Everything I had was definitely above par, but nothing screamed super original. Totally worth the trip though!

Great Italian spot in downtown SF! Came here with my girlfriends on a Tuesday and would definitely recommend getting a reservations. It will get packed! They also offer complimentary bread sticks. For appetizers we ordered Burrta Cheese with green peppercorn marinated strawberries / almonds / basil / old balsamico. SOO GOOD! As for entrees, you should order pasta and it comes in two portion options. - Stracci: rye pasta "rags" / rossotti ranch veal sugo / roasted mushrooms- Coujette: occitaine chive potato gnocchi / mt. shasta porcini mushroom ragu / chives- Trofie: hand rolled pasta / haricots verts / new potatoes / basil and pine nut pesto / pecorino cheese

I have planned several events here, from simple networking lunches to private dinners for groups of 50+ with the guidance of their special events manager, Stephen. Each time, my inbox fills up with glowing "thank you" emails from my clients. Perbacco is one of the first places I call when I need a classy venue to host a corporate meal.Not only is the food delicious, but they are accommodating to all kinds of allergies, not batting an eye when I tell them someone is allergic to dairy and gluten and does not eat red meat. It always feels like they go the extra mile to make sure everything goes smoothly and that even *I* as the main point of contact have an enjoyable time when I am running around making sure my event is going smoothly.Aside from that, I have dined here on my own and enjoyed my experience here even as a regular patron. I lived in Italy for a period of time a few years ago and the food here, especially the pasta, remind me of that time.

Came here for lunch with a few co-workers and first impression was that it was VERY loud. It didn't bother me, but for those who want to have a business lunch to discuss business things, not sure if this would be a good lunch spot.Service was great! From the hostess to the waitresses/waiters, and bartenders. They all greeted us and said goodbye when we left.Love the open kitchen layout! It's pretty cool to see the line and watch the talented chefs in action. Wish we were seated at the tables right by the kitchen. I had a pino grigio, not bad. We ordered an appetizer that had fried olives, fried shrimp, fried onions, not sure what it was called. The shrimp was on the small side and the sauce that it came with was bland...could've kicked it up a notch just by adding more acid. The sauce basically tasted like mayo.For my main, I ordered the fishermans stew. it had two toasted pieces of bread with the what looked like plain mayo sauce, shrimp, mussels, clams, etc. Boy did they really butcher the seafood. I'm not sure if I was because it was busy, but the seafood was overly boiled and became extremely rubbery. I'd give them another chance but it just sucks that they did such injustice to the seafood!

We came in with some of an expectations as we were referred by our hotel.Not much flavor built into the food. Every single fish was BLAND. The service was also the same as the flavor. To top it all off, the portions are extremely small (for dinner) as if the food is "gourmet"Maybe if was an off day for this establishment

If you're looking for a great Italian Restaurant in the Financial District of SF, this is definitely a must!! We were staying in Union Square and took an uber over to the restaurant, which made life much easier in terms of traffic and parking. Now for the good stuff, for appetizers we ordered the Carne Cruda (tartare of beef tenderloin) and Brown Butter Brussels Sprouts. Both starters were excellent! For our main courses we ordered the Piastra Seared Scallops which was light, refined and phenomenal, and the Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs which was just mouthwatering delicious!! Our meals were perfectly paired with a Cabernet Sauvignon. As for dessert, we indulged in the Brutti Ma Buoui (hazelnut cookies) and the Burnt Caramel Gelato and of course a delicious cappuccino to top off this lovely course. Service was friendly and attentive. This is definitely a place for foodies!!

Perbacco was very busy when I came for lunch so I suggest that reservations are in order. I had the Plin Al Brasato - tender pockets of pasta filled with flavorful short rib meat in a luscious truffle red wine sauce. For $19, this pasta was well worth it. I also tried the brussels sprouts and my friend's chicken dish - both were tasty and excellent. The brussels sprouts were tender and nicely salty. The chicken was moist and not overcooked. Service was friendly, although I didn't realize how loud it was in the restaurant until our waiter started speaking and I could barely hear him, although he was standing right in front of me. I'd love to return for dinner!

FOOD POISONING! BEWARE! Was visiting San Francisco and wanted a nice "Italian" dinner so decided to try out Perbacco. Our waiter was unpleasant and the menu didn't really scream Italian food. Either way, we ordered the "carne cruda" which is essentially beef tartare. Approximately 17 min later my boyfriend is sick in the bathroom. Approximately one hour later I'm sick in the bathroom. This goes on for the next 12 hours. Either our waiter played a really bad joke or they don't know how to handle raw food. Either way, I give one star for my food poisoning experience and ruining my first trip to SF.

I got taken to this place tonight because I "like Italian". Sorry, but this food is tasteless. I sent back the Frito Misto... and the pastas were pretty much useless. It's got a nice ambience, and the service is fine... but Italian is all about the food and this place just doesn't have it. I'll never be back.

Absolutely amazing! For appetizers had the raw tuna and avocado salad and they were both the freshest and most delicious raw foods to want to begin with. The tuna was paired with a delicious sauce, avocado, oranges, and grapefruit which made it perfectly zesty and fresh. The avocado salad was delicious with various leaves that left a refreshing taste after each bite. For entre I had the paparadelle and scallops which were both made to perfection. Scallops were so tender and cooked just right and the pasta was hearty and delicious. Would definitely recommend and come again

To start this place is WAY overrated in me and my husbands opinion. We dined at the restaurant last night per a friends suggestion that it received almost 5 star reviews and a Zagat rating. We were greeted by a nice enough staff that showed us to our table; however when I asked the hostess if we could just sit one table from where we were she acted as though we asked for a VIP seat at the queens table! No biggie we took our booth at the corner of the restaurant. Next we were given menus, which were extremely difficult to read and understand and we're from the Wine country so we're definitely used to reading upper scale type menus. We were then assisted by our waiter, which took down our appetizer choices a beet salad for me and a beef tar tar for my husband. The beet salad was one of the worst I've ever tasted with shriveled up beets and a very dark and extremely bitter green which I have no idea what it was! I immediately decided I'm not eating this horrible bitter thing they're calling a salad and placed it in front of the table expecting our waiter to immediately notice it since he never even bothered asking how anything tasted after he dropped off the appetizers. However he didn't even notice and the water server who was more attentive to our needs replaced it with what they call their market green salad, which is not on the menu...why I have no idea! The waiter made it sound as though it was a big secret! My husband enjoyed the beef tar tar and I thought it was average. The water server then brought out the market salad, which I did think was very fresh with greens but much too lemony on the dressing. Then came the horrible entrees. I ordered the "famous" pappardelle pasta with short rib ragu and my husband ordered the veal chop. First the pappardelle was nothing like I've ever had. It hardly contained any pasta and the ragu was a sweet shredded beef more like a stew than a beef pasta sauce. My husbands vealchop was strange to stay the least with orange zest in the crust which was very overwhelming and made it taste just like Chinese lemon chicken at a mediocre Chinese restaurant...not at all what we expected from this highly rated and in our opinion over rated establishment. To add insult to injury we had an extremely inattentive waiter who only seemed interested in us when it came time to pay! Save your money and dine at Michael Mina close by or Tadich.

The hostess that sat us wasn't the nicest. The other one who is taller and at the podium was nicer. The waitress we had was not that attentive. We requested to see a menu and never received it. There must've been like 15 waiters and waitresses at the restaurant and we had one that was just okay. Frito misto fell short. Shrimp was too fishy and veggies were okay(not too crispy). The skirt steak was good and after a few more bites, it seemed gross. Restaurant tends to get very loud during busy hours and reservations are recommended.

Oh man, Perbacco.. I can't pronounce your name or any of the items on your menu, but the pastas here are really some of the best I've had! It was double date night and we had a reservation for 9 pm, but got there around 7. We were absolutely famished and were lucky to be able to be seated immediately upon arrival. The restaurant had a lot of open tables when we arrived, but filled up pretty quick! While waiting for our orders, we had bread sticks and bread with the most delicious pesto dip!We ordered the burrata with strawberries as an appetizer and oh my goodness... this was one of the highlights of the meal. The cheese is so delicious with the strawberries and almonds, I think I could eat this every single day! For my entree, I ordered the gnocchi with chestnuts and persimmons (it had a much fancier name, sorry I didn't jot it down). It's not the fluffiest gnocchi I've ever had, but it had really good flavors. I haven't had chestnuts in a pasta dish before, it definitely was interesting! The boyfriend ordered agnolotti (again, it had a much fancier name) and this was really yummy! It was somewhat similar to a ravioli, except it was stuffed with delicious meats! I really enjoyed this dish! The other couple ordered tajarine (these noodles were like fresh ramen noodles, really tasty!) and pappardelle (had short rib and was definitely one of my other favorites of the night). At the end of our main courses we were completely stuffed! But for some reason still ordered two desserts to share. I ordered the salted chocolate cake with honeycomb and grapes and cherries. It was very delicious, but heavy. Definitely worth the try! The other couple ordered a panna cotta that had thyme in it. It was very interesting, although I have to say I preferred my cake better!TL;DR: SF has so many amazing restaurants to try, and Perbacco is one of the ones I'd definitely want to come back to some time! I'm definitely going to be dreaming about that burrata!
