Have been wanting to try out Tony's for a while but you know how it gets with the huge lines and their 1.5 hours wait especially on weekends :( Ugh!!! I hate SF city only for the silly lines! Let us eat people ;)We found the perfect trick though - put your name down and go hang out in the city do some close by sightseeing (Ina Coolbrith park or Coit Tower) and roam around for that miserable 1 hour and something and come back ready to eat the best damn pizza in town. You heard me!We got lucky with our plan and it worked out perfectly because they messaged us saying our table was ready as we were walking right in. I was too happy!!!We didn't want to wait extra time to be seated outside (which is perfect on hot days as it gets quite hot inside due to the wood fired ovens) so we opted for inside seating. Who cares about the heat when I'm lucky enough to try Tony's pizza? Move over!!!Our waitress was super friendly and bathrooms were pretty decent and clean so all that checked out!Between the 4 of us we shared:- Margarita pizza (only 73 a day)- Diavola (the best!!!)- Marinara (could pass on it)Let me tell you about how much i loved the pizzas. The dough was thin, that beautiful red sauce had the homemade taste and those toppings were the shizzle! Pizzas were soooo light I cannot get over it. Simple and clean taste, just how I like it. I must go to Napoli now and find out if they make better pizza than Tony :PJokes aside, you must try Tony's at least once if you come prepared for the wait strategy.Tony Amore Ti Amo Tanto! A Presto!!!

I came on a Saturday evening and waiting for 45 minutes. Got seated at 6:15PM! They text you when your table is ready (very nice!) I ordered the Margherita pizza because this is one of the pizzas they are known for. I was afraid they wouldn't have the Margherita since they only make 73 a day but they did! The Margherita was made nicely. Simple dough, fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. The bottom can taste a little charred in some areas. If you want something light and not oily, then this is the pizza for you. Perfect for two people to share, but you would want to add a side. ---If you had good pizza from Italy then this doesn't compare at all. But it is good quality and simple pizza (a bit expensive for $24 as of today). If you're looking for something truly satisfying (savory and meaty) then this isn't for you.---We also ordered the lillet blanc fries which had pancetta pieces, parmesan and honey. It came freshly fried and hot. It's a good appetizer to share and to munch on while waiting for your pizza! I'll need to come back another time to try other dishes because they have such a wide variety of pizzas! Now for service... our server was great. Attentive and had great manners. HOWEVER, the host was not the friendliest. I know this place is very busy and can get hectic but I wish this host had better manners. The host was working by herself and it looked like she needed some help.. Not once did she smile and look at people like she cared. I truly understand it is stressful to manage all the customers wanting to get on the list and seating customers, but it would be nice if she acknowledged others who were patiently waiting. There was a lot of walking away from customers and ignoring them. She could have said "I'll be with you in a moment" rather than walk away and come back and leave the customers hanging. Management--please do something about this.

I wanted to love Tony's, but can't help to feel a little underwhelmed after my visit here. The pizza didn't quite live up to the expectations I had. The award winning Margherita was not super noteworthy. I found it too greasy for a vegetarian pizza and the texture was pretty soggy. We all liked the Diavola much better, which is naturally more greasy, but also could hold it much better and didn't soak all the way through. All in all not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but there's better.Service was on point though, super friendly and attentive. It probably helped that we were there at 5.30, well before the crowds. Not sure, if I would make my way there just for Tony's, but I'd give it another try when in the area.

Awesome Pizza!!....After hearing high praise about this pizza place from nearly everyone I asked, including friends, friends of friends, and strangers in uber/lyft rides, we finally went here to bring-in my wife's birthday and meet some friends old and new. The wait, food and drinks all delivered on its promise of being something that we will go back to and bring other to.We had the Margherita (one of their most famous pizzas, especially if you have someone vegetarian in your group ;) ) and the New Yorker (gold medal winner las vegas 2013) pizza. Both the pizzas were good. But, I really liked the New Yorker. The italian fennel and calabrese sausage and the rocitta cheese along with all the seasonings made it awesome. To tell you the truth I usually add some chilli flakes to my pizza to make it a little more spicy and flavorful, but in this case I did not have to add anything and this pizza had to be enjoyed as is, which for me is very impressive and makes this place unique for me.The drinks: this place has some wonderful drinks. We were a large group so we were able to try a number things here, including the red sangria, some wine (Barbera d' Alba), and an Old Fashioned. All of them were amazing and made the experience even more memorable.I will definitely be going back here and the next pizzas that are on my list to try are the Tartufo and Cal Italia.Enjoy some good pizza!!.. Ciao

Ate at Tony's Pizza for the very first time on Monday and O M G. Their pizza is simply amazing! From a glance, the restaurant seems small, but when you go inside there is a whole other side with lots of seating. There is also a lot of seating outside. Since it was lunch time, it was pretty packed, but we were able to be seated inside right away. We let my cousin order since he has been here before so we got the New Yorker which is a coal fired pizza. Again O M G! I only had 1 piece since they were big pieces but it was so good. I was seriously dreaming of more of this pizza the rest of the day. I might need to make a special trip to Tony's now each time when I'm in the city. =)

AMAAAAAZING PIZZA!Wait time:We came here after hiking and running in Angel's Island. We were pretty hungry - we arrived at 5 pm on a Friday afternoon, and there was already a line. We put in our names (party of 6) at the host stand, and she told us it would be a 30 min wait. Not bad (although I was pretty hungry so I thought it was still a long time). She took our number and said she'd text us when they were ready.At around 6 pm, though, the wait time for 2 people was 1 hour. Service:When we came back to the restaurant after our walk, the hostess wasn't the most friendly. She seemed a little annoyed that we were back and told us she hadn't texted us yet. We waited a bit longer and got seated outside. They took awhile getting to us to take our orders. The table was also a bit small for all the pizza we ordered, and it was also slanted (since we were sitting on a hill)Food: AWESOME. We ordered the Margarita (which won the pizza competition in Naples), New Yorker, gigantic meatball with sea salt and burrata, italian salad, and the sausage and stout. All were delicious. I was a little disappointed by the margarita, but it is a pretty simple pizza if that is what you like. The tomatoes weren't very citrusy. The best part of it was the dough: very chewy and light.My favorite was the New Yorker: lots of meat, big but thin slices, and very flavorful! Pretty pricey for pizza though... they ranged from $20-40 per pizza... definitely not cheap, so come with big wallets and big appetites.

Updated review
Food: 5/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5*** MICHELIN Guide 2016, 2017 ****** Food Network *** TONY'S PIZZA!!!! Dang this place is good, beyond good. It's been on my wish list forever. After 3 attempts of more than 2hr long waits, I came in at 12pm on a weekday right when they open and got my table in 15 minutes. Apart from being on the Michelin guide, Tony's Pizza had won the World Pizza Cup, gold medal winner las vegas 2014, gold medal winner food network pizza champions challenge, gold cup winner international pizza championships, and much more. Many of the pizzas have limited servings per day due to the precious imports of Neapolitan and Italian ingredients. They offer several styles of pizzas which include Neapolitan, Classic American and Italian, Sicilian, Pizza Romana, Gluten Free and New York, Detroit and St. Louis Style. We finally settled on 2 of the award winning ones - MARGHERITA and CAL ITALIA. MARGHERITA 12" (world pizza cup winner naples, italy 2007) is Napoletana Style - 900 Degree Wood Fired pizza, limited 73 per day. Dough finished by hand using caputo red flour then proofed in napoletana wood boxes, san marzano tomatoes D.O.P., sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil. The pizza had a thin and soft bottom crust, slightly wet middle, chewy and doughy outer crust. It was pretty small, around 10 inches. This was my absolute favorite pizza!! It is quite pricey at $21 for such a small size, but it is SO GOOD. the mozzarella balls are melted perfectly, chewy yet not too rich nor salty, and the crust is just beyond this world. CAL ITALIA 12" (gold medal winner food network pizza champions challenge) is Classic Italian Style - 650 Degree Gas or 700 Degree Electric. The pizza was a hand tossed rustic medium crust with asiago, mozzarella, italian gorgonzola, croatian sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano, balsamic reduction, no sauce. It was slightly bigger than Napoletana Margherita, around 12 inches, priced at $23. The crust was thin and crispy at the bottom(you can hold it up parallel to the plate), and had a crispy outer crust. I loved the sweet fig preserve and honey that gives the pizza its sweetness, and asiago cheese and prosciutto for its saltiness. It was slightly too salty for me and the asiago cheese was a bit too rich after a while. However, great pizza.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Second visit, tried something different. LITTLE ITALY salad - mixed greens, chopped castelveltrano olives,walnuts, imported italian gorgonzola, olive oil, balsamic reduction, cherry tomatoes, shaved parmigiano. Huge portion, very very delicious. Loved the dressing & cheese combo!NEW YORKER 16" (gold medal winner las vegas 2013) is Coal Fired Style - 1000 Degree. Serves 2-4. Mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, calabrese sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano. This one is about twice the size as Margherita or Cal Italia, and you definitely get your money worth. LOVED the ricotta and mozzarella on tomato pizza. The meat combo was a bit too heavy, but very delicious nonetheless. Order this if you're hungry and want something good and hearty.Favorites:* MARGHERITA ($21)* NEW YORKER ($29)* LITTLE ITALY salad ($12)Others:* CAL ITALIA ($23)

I can't believe I haven't been here the whole time I've lived in SF. Mainly because the lines are ALWAYS crazy long, so I always bypass this as an option in North Beach. It just so happened my friends and I were looking for place to eat a super late lunch at 3pm and of course at the off-hour there was no line. We took this opportune moment and snagged a seat.Wow... I've never seen so. many. pizza. options. I wanted one of each... Be prepared to waver between decisions and figure out what to share with the group. I gotta say that the Margarita and the New York styled pizzas were my favorite. FYI if you don't want to wait, you can always go over to Slice House, where they serve NY styled pizzas. Service is a bit meh here but the food is so worth it!!! I will be back if I'm ever looking for a late lunch at 3pm...

If you're in the area and have some time to wait on a table (whew that was a long wait), this place is definitely worth checking out. I heard they were pretty well known so decided I had to try it. Once we landed a spot we were so hungry that both a pizza and huge meatball sounded like the way to go. We tried the famous Margherita which came on a thin crust. I usually don't go for margarita pizzas and I'm a huge proponent of thicker crust, but for this one I was changed! The flavors were unique and I was such a fan of the basil. Also, the cheese was definitely an experience itself. I'd go back just to have a slice again. The meatball gigante was huge (living up to its name) and smothered in marinara sauce with cheese. I was amazed by the flavors that culminated in the beef and was enough to make me not even worry we had no meat on the pizza. I'm so glad I got to experience this place and will be back for more pizza filled nights in San Francisco.

"From your grocer's freezer to North Beach"The infamous Tony has arrived. You may remember him from such $1 pizzas as Tony's Original Pepperoni Pizza or Tony's Supreme Pizza. I came here in search of pizza. Apparently not every restaurant in Little Italy sells pizza (go figure!). I noticed this place because of the long line outside. That usually means one of two things: either the food is good or the service is slow. It was a little bit of both.This is a stand up, get a slice, and walk out kind of joint. There is a table or two but there's also nice park outside to enjoy the slice of heaven. There are two registers for above average efficiency. Red pepper packs to go. Oh and of course vegan food options.Overall it's a pretty good place. Not bad, not fantastic, but it hit the spot. Stop by if you want a slice to go.LIFE'S MYSTERIES: So yeah I get it, this probably isn't the Tony of frozen food aisle fame, but then why are the pepperoni's so reminiscent of my childhood. They're little circles prone to curling up. You know what I'm talking about!

Pizza was delicious, closest thing we could find that compares to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. Would definitely go again! Just beware that the line gets pretty long. We got there about 15 minutes before opening this past Sunday and there were about 30 people in front of us.

First time here when I visited the Bay Area recently, and I enjoyed it there! My girlfriend and I ordered the marinara pizza, which is an extremely basic oven baked pizza with just marinara sauce and roasted garlic (no cheese), and you know what? It was delicious! And since it didn't contain cheese, it was helpful since I am lactose intolerant lol And the pizza was only $14! We also ordered a round of cocktails while enjoying the pizza and enjoyed the beautiful San Francisco weather while sitting out on their patio! :)

While this place is fairly pricy it's the highest quality pizza you can get. I thought they used to do deep dish but no longer. The New Yorker is a fabulous award winning pizza. I forget the rest of what we ordered but this is a must visit on any visit to north beach. It's always pretty busy and I don't think they take reservations. I would suggest putting your name in, buying a drink from the licquor store and hanging out in Washington square park for the time being.

This place was crowded even on a weekday at 5PM. Seeing the Yelp reviews on the Margarita Pizza, we figured the pizza was a must try. We also ordered the Seafood Linguine since there were three of us. The pizza wasn't as hyped as reviews say. Yes, the dough was very soft. Yes, the flavors do balance well. But was it worth $23 for dough, sauce, and cheese? Nope. The bottom of our pizza was also burnt. HOWEVER, the seafood linguine was absolutely amazing. The pasta had a good bite to it. And this seafood to pasta ratio was perfect. There must have been more than 3 shrimps in there, tons of shellfish, tossed in a delicious sauce. One whole plate would be too heavy, but sharing it with people makes the dish much more enjoyable. Service was exceptional. Our waitress recommended us two cocktails in which we greatly enjoyed. Even with a long crowd forming outside, we were not rushed to finish our food or to pay.

3,000+ reviews, a CRAZY long and extensive menu filled with countless pizza options based on degree of the oven, Tony's was a must during my SF visit as I basically breathe pizza. The struggle for pizza was so real after walking through the 'Little Italy' district that I actually canceled my birthday reservation at a sushi restaurant and decided to celebrate here instead (a place that does not take reservations, so pretty risky move). We arrived at 6 pm - I was semi relieved and super super excited when I didn't really see a crowd / line outside. You can imagine my look of disappointment when we got inside and were quoted a wait time of an hour to an hour and a half for a table of two. It wasn't even prime dinner hours too! We headed over to the park across the street to dog watch and returned an hour later hoping our table would be ready soon - it wasn't.... That's when we got impatient and asked if we can do bar seating...which you actually can... It's first come first serve in the most aggressive way possible. You literally might have to fight for a table as a line isn't really formed and anyone is allowed to stand anywhere to grab any empty seat they want. I felt pretty anxious if you couldn't tell, but we were finally able to grab two bar seats around 7:20 and were texted that our table was ready at exactly 7:30 lol. So waiting for bar seating isn't that much easier as everyone takes their time eating / drinking and just staying there to chat afterwards. You would think having an hour+ to look through the menu, I'd know what to order, but the more I looked at the menu, the more conflicted I was - definitely bring a large group so you can sample multiple pies! To stalk some more and having read that they only serve 25 large meatballs per day, we first ordered the meat ball with mushroom, pancetta, and cream sauce. Holy moly, this was THE BEST meatball I've had in my entire life. It legitimately made us forget about the gruesome wait and we automatically deemed the wait so worth it. The meatball was so tender that it fell apart with the cut of the spoon. The best part though was the sauce, hands down. I thought the meatball would come in just the cream sauce - no, it actually comes to you in a mini skillet sitting on tomato sauce and then the employee pours the cream sauce above at the table, so you see all the sizzling action. The combination of the tomato and cream sauce was heaven. I shamelessly told the waiter that I wanted to keep the plate of sauce so I can dip my pizza crust in there. HIGHLY recommend you do the same. You'll get a weird look, but seriously it's amazing. As a meat lover and focaccia lover, I went with the Regina pie, as prosciutto, soppressata, and arugula sounded amazing on deep dense focaccia bread. The menu said feeds 2-6, but I obviously overlooked that aspect - once the pizza arrived, everyone on our side of the bar looked at us and clapped saying we went big. It seriously feeds 6 though as it comes with 12 thick square slices. I have a heavy appetite and I even tapped out after 3 slices; I actually would have ate two, but it was too good that I had to force another slice. We boxed up the rest of the 6 slices to go. I ate a slice the next day cold and it was still amazing. I can't imagine how much more amazing it would have been if I heated it up. Seriously though, Tony's is a must. The wait will be long, but just do it. I almost came back the next day....

I left feeling stuffed and in need of a nap. There was a line to put your name down, but the bar seating is first come first serve. A couple left just in time.

For a pizza joint, this spot is top notch.The Caesar salad can easily be shared by two or more. Ordered the 1/2 regular and 1/2 spicy Calamari and the meatballs, both good, but I crave pizza.I tried the Margherita, the Gigante, the New Yorker and the Cali Italia. Choose wisely, because they all can be so different, and all soooooo good.

Man...I really wanted to love this place. When our Lyft driver saw where we were going for dinner, she sounded so jealous and was saying she's been dying to try this place...so we were more excited to try it! My colleague and I (in town for work) wanted pizza, used Yelp, found this place.For starters, I had the meatballs. I have to say, this was the best part of the meal. They were absolutely delicious, and tasted just like my Nonna's. I could've eaten 100. The menu features different types of pizza, grouped together by categories. So you have New York style, Detroit style, Sicilian etc. I wanted a particular Sicilian style pizza, but the waiter told me that it was rather large and really wasn't meant for one person, but that he could do similar flavours on a grandma pizza which would be more for 1-2 people. So I settled for that.To give you context in how much I love pizza, I have a rather large pizza tattoo on my leg that says "piz forever", so believe me when I say I LOVE pizza.I have had my share of dollar slices, bad take out pizza, but this was easily the worst pizza I have ever had. It was extremely sweet, as if Ragu tomato sauce was the base. It was also so crispy that it was hard to eat. I ate two small squares and took the rest to go. I'm sure there are amazing pizzas here, but this one was NOT one of them, and it totally ruined my experience. Thumbs up for the meatball though.

LEGIT. We were not disappointed! We arrived during dinner prime time, so there was a line to put our names down. We opted for the bar instead, which is first come, first serve--saved us 40 minutes of waiting for a table. The menu will definitely intimate you, because there are a TON of options. Be prepared: do your research in advance and have an idea of what you want, otherwise you'll be overwhelmed. Get the coal fired New Yorker (mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, calabrese sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano), if you're not in the mood for a meatless pizza. The guy at the bar and the couple next to us recommended it. Don't underestimate this 16" bad boy--the 4 slices are substantial. We made the brutal mistake of ordering an extra dish. If you're not that hungry, just stick to the pizza. Otherwise, if you're starving, the Bucatini housemade pasta is relatively tasty (huge portion, btw). The friendly guy at the bar was exceptionally hospitable--he was always checking up on us and provided great recommendations. + Pastas: healthy options available with whole wheat penne pasta or gluten-free spaghetti+ Gluten-free crust available for $3 extra

When we arrived around 7:30 on a week night, we were told to wait in line for 1 hour. We decided to wait and luckily got seated at VIP table less then 10 min wait. VIP table is a bar facing the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. It was a bit hot but we were greatful to be seated so quick. We ordered classic tomato pizza with meatball pasta. The food was top notch, i would have given ten star here if i could. Also the service was incredible. Needless to say the best restaurant in SF

Rude rude rude.....the waitress was extremely rude, insisted I share my pizza......I deliberately told him, no I do not want to share this pizza and he kept insisting because of the size. Pizza was good but too expensive for the price. I wouldn't have left a review until I was robbed from you all. I signed my bill for 35.68....I check my account the total is 48.80, how on heavens earth? I had cash so my friend and I split the tip using our cash, not to mention the bill wasn't split down the middle properly so I had to give her a couple of dollars to balance it out!!!! Never will go here again, and I'm so upset that someone would violate my money and charge me extra when I didn't agree to it, I will be fighting this with my bank!!!!

3.5 stars The menu here is an amalgam of many cities' pizzerias. Classic Margherita -- Tony's got that, but in limited offer. Whether you think east or west coast is the best coast, they've got a pizza that represents where you're from. If you're indecisive, the choices will have your head spinning. Grad school buddy & I met up for a meal & I really think my disappointment stems from ordering the wrong items. Little Italy salad was plain despite the interesting list of ingredients. I chose the Sausage & Stout pizza (only 23 made per day), made up of hearty & heavy beer sausage & fontina cheese on a doughy crust. There's stout in the crust, a sweet stout reduction drizzled atop, & the pie is finished with beer salt. Their commitment to stout is astounding! As unique as our pick was, I couldn't stop wishing I'd ordered a calzone or Margherita to share -- something with a marinara base. Looking forward to trying these specific items next visit. I absolutely enjoyed my Ketel One Moscow Mule. So refreshing; it went down a little too easily. Ultra friendly hostess, bartender, & wait staff. Everyone we encountered had the best attitude.

Luckily, we saw this place on the Food Network while we were relaxing in our San Fran hotel and decided to stop by for dinner.We sat at the bar, which had no wait. The bartender was really talented and put effort into all the drinks he made. He made my husband an awesome orange moscow mule.We shared a meatball gigante with wild mushroom, pancetta, and cream sauce. This was AMAZING. The meatball itself was a perfect blend and the sauce was da bomb. We also had the Margherita pizza which was good (but nothing special), but coming from NYC, it's easy to find a great pizza pie.

This place is just incredible. Has all different types of pizzas from different places all over the US. My fav is the philly pie. The sauce is fantastic and the garlic bread might be the best we have ever had. The pizzas are not that large so keep that in mind and come expecting to wait. This place is so popular that you could be waiting 90 mins for a table. So don't show up famished...lolAlso ordered a side of veggies that was very good. Full bar is well stocked and they have some fun specialty drinks. And north beach is a fun place to walk around too.

The pizza selection here is HUGE. They have it organized by style and in each category, you have the choice of electric, gas, coal, or wood fired. I was a little overwhelmed with all the selection, so I just picked their Margherita pizza. According to the menu, it is a world pizza cup winner in Italy in 2007 and they only make 73 of these a day. Sold! The dough is finished by hand using caputo red flour and then proofed in a Napoletana wood box. The toppings include San Marzano tomatoes, sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, and extra virgin olive oil.It was a super simple pizza, but very flavorful. It was also enough pizza to share or for one person to eat. I like my pizzas a little less saucy and more cheesy and this one barely had cheese on it. It was dripping and hard to eat bc it was saucy. Def needed a knife and fork.I sat at the bar bc there was a wait for a table. The service was only so-so. They switched shifts in the middle and I had a couple of different bartenders. The one bartender did make me a custom mule. It was refreshing, not sweet, and very delicious. Only gripe is the pricing. My pizza was one of the less expensive ones at $22,but there were also pizzas on the menu that cost more than $30. I would come back and try more pizza but not as a solo traveler.

Worth the wait? You bet it is! Tony's Pizza Napoletana is hands down the best pizzeria in San Francisco, and I say that without hesitation.If you're really in a rush, they have a sister store next door that you can get within 5 minutes or less... but if you want the real deal, then I suggest you get here before the dinner rush. It will be around a 40 minute to an hour and a half wait to sit inside. They have a strict seating policy in which all of the members of your party must be present... otherwise, they won't seat you.The dining experience at Tony's was superb. Certain menu items like the Margherita and the Meatball Gigante are limited in quantities, but I highly recommend that you order these along with whatever you plan to eat. Our party ordered a few pasta dishes along with the New Yorker Pizza that was suggested to us by the waitress. If you love meat on your pizza, this would be something you would need to try. They also have an interesting variety of ingredients like quail egg, artichokes, and sundried tomatoes that looked amazing.If you're in the North Beach area and are in the mood for some amazing quality pizza, I urge you to seek this place out and give it a try.

Not sure why people rave about this place, perhaps because we ordered take out our experience was lacking? We arrived at Tony's 5 minutes after they opened and there was already a line out the door. Decided to order take out and eat it in Washington park, just across the corner. I placed my order for a napoletana margherita and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes. My husband left exactly 25 minutes later and grabbed the pizza (it's a 2 minute walk). When he got back and we opened it up, you could already tell it was burnt. I grabbed a slice anyway and it was cold! I'm not talking lukewarm, but COLD. It looks like it was cooked, but certainly didn't feel that way. I ate my cold, burned pizza and was incredibly disappointed with this local favorite. The two stars are because the staff wasn't rude, despite other reviews, and they let us fill our water bottle. Would not recommend coming here; there are plenty of other options to chose from.

Been here a couple of times now and haven't been disappointed. They actually do better at various regional pizzas than the Italian ones in my opinion. The Saint Louis style pizza is truly authentic and somehow better than I've ever had in Saint Louis. All the ingredients are quality. Without reservations I can easily say this is the best pizza in SF.

The food was amazing, but the service was just ok. After the hour wait we ordered some bread, and then our mains. Our bread came, and one person received his food. We thought it was odd, but then we waited, and waited, well you get what's happening. So I had asked for some extra sauce. So finally the rest of the food arrived, and she said oh I'll bring the sauce. So we dug in, then my friend finished his food, and we had just started ours. So he wanted some more sauce, we flagged her down. Let me just say we never got our sauce. That would have been fine if she would have just said were out, or no then waiting 45min for nothing.

Alright... believe the hype! I was in the area and decided to stop by Tony's. I got the margherita pizza for $5.50. It's a LARGE slice so worth the price. I was very impressed with how perfect the slice was... fresh toppings, soft dough, perfect crunch with the bottom crust, and the actual crust was soft. Pretty impressive slice of pizza... I don't think I've ever had a slice of pizza that was perfectly baked. Very "wow-ed", will be back again!

Bold statement but this may be my favorite pizza in the city. I had been wanting to try Tony's for the past five years but was always deterred by the long line. They're popular - can't fault them for that. So, when I decided to take a "staycation" I knew that this was my chance. Got over to Tony's at around 1:45 pm on a Wednesday with my roommate. We were seated immediately and had our choice of an inside or outside table. There were definitely still a decent number of patrons filtering in and out of the restaurant which I was surprised by on a Wednesday. Gotta love the tourists though.The Menu: This can seem overwhelming because of how it's organized into different sections but we basically let our waitress know we were a bit overwhelmed and she was great at helping. She posed a few questions to us: (1) crunchy crust or chewy and charred? (2) deep dish or thin crust? (3) traditional or a little out there? With all of that, we narrowed it down to the Tartufo (chewy & charred, thin crust, a little out there) and it was the perfect choice for us. The mushrooms, cheese, arugula, prosciutto, and truffle were perfectly done with the exact balance between all ingredients. We had one pizza between the two of us (so three slices each). It was a bit pricey but that's what SF sales tax is for. Service was also good!I don't think Tony's is overrated at all and I can see why the long wait. If you can swing coming by in an off time, you will be glad you did.

Amazing place! If you are a fan of pizza and cocktail s you must go here! The service is just as good as the delicious food! Honestly this is the best pizza I've ever had, and we eat a lot of different pizzas. Our favorite was the award winning New Yorker. I am very picky about cocktails and the "this is how I roll" was hands down fantastic! Please check this place out when you can. You won't be disappointed.Only semi complaint is there are no reservations so the wait can be 1-2hrs on busy nights, but still worth it! And just get a drink and hang out at the bar

Reading the reviews and book for Tony's got me really excited to try this place while I was on vacation in SF. As most well reviewed places in SF are, the wait times will be long. Tony's was no exception. We came when the afternoon shift was transitioning to dinner service and had to wait extra to be seated while the staff finished their preparations. We ordered two pizzas and honestly, I really wanted to like both of the them. The sauce was great, the toppings were fine, but the crust was burnt. I don't mind a little char on the edges and frankly I'm all for it, but our pizzas were flat out burnt on the bottom. I ate a few slices and my father and I looked at each other trying to avoid mentioning the burnt pizza. After waiting so long and raving about how good it's going to be, the elephant in the room was the pizza. I mentioned the crust to our waiter and he shrugged it off telling us that the pizza is supposed to be that way due to the cooking method. I tried to persist, but it was fruitless. The disregard for putting the customer first in this case really made me not want to return to Tony's ever again. The wait is too long, the pizza is average, and the customer service when a fault is made ruined the experience. Save your money and go someplace else.

Too much hype? Perhaps. A solid pizza nonetheless. There is something about coal and wood fired ovens that automatically draws you to a pizza joint and this place showcases theirs right by the guest tables.The ambiance was cool and the service was good, but we were not impressed by their pizza, salad and meatballs.The Little Italy salad was drenched in dressing and over-powered by gorgonzola. The meatballs were bland the New Yorker pizza was absolutely dominated by pepperoni (although I do love pepperoni that curls up, I also want to be able to appreciate my cheese, sauce and crust). Unfortunately, we didn't feel like any of the dishes had balance. I wish we had stuck with our gut and ordered their Margherita pizza, but went instead with the customer favorite New Yorker. I give them kudos for their service, as they quickly replaced the incorrect pizza that was first served to us. This place will get you a good pizza, but it wasn't something to write home about for us.Tourist tip: after putting your name on the list for a table, walk around the area as you wait to be contacted (~1 hour).

I have been wanting to go to Tony's actual spot for years now. And when we had he chance to go this past weekend during the North Beach Festival, I was super excited. Thinking the wait was going to be forever, I went in to see the hostess. She said there had been a cancellation and she could seat us now if we were ok with a booth at the back of the bar. What luck!!! I grabbed the rest of my party and dragged them in. Then we waited. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. Kept on waiting for anyone to come by. Not to mention the non-existent AC during this past weekends 90 degree weather in the city. I was sitting, dripping sweat and couldn't wait anymore. As much as I wanted to try he oh so famous Margarita- I couldn't do it. So, we left. Went next door to the slice house, got a piece of pepperoni and called it a day.I'll have to give them another try at some point.

Now, we all know this place is uber famous. The guy won some pizza making contest in Italy or something? My brother (who still lives on the East Coast, who also LOVES pizza) kept asking me if I had ever tried this place. My answers were always the same, no, it's always too busy or no, I'm not going to wait 2 hours for pizza. One night we tried to go and it was pretty early, maybe 5pm? However, it was also Columbus Day, the wait was just far too long. BUT when my brother came to visit, I got to try this world famous pizza.We went for lunch on a Friday. Had no issues getting a table right away. We got the fancy, famous, margerita pizza. You know, the one they only make a 73 per day, one? Yeah, we got that. It was really good, nothing too special. Not saying it was bad but nowadays, I feel like there are more of those million degree oven, quick cooking pizza places out there. Very light and fluffy, not too big, perfect for an appetizer. ---yes I did just say a pizza was great for an app.We also got the coal fired, 1000 degree oven, New Yorker. Which, you will learn by reading the menu that it was the "gold medal winner Las Vegas 2013". This thing, was REALLY good, I do have to do say; I was extremely impressed. I totally see how it won. It was sweet, salty, crispy, chewy, all of the above. I would highly recommend getting this pie but beware, it's not available 3-4 pm each day.I now live right next to one of Tony's Slice House pizza places. The pizza there is good but I think it's probably slightly better at the restaurant and you have more options. If you're ever craving some good pizza, check this place out!

Walked in with a party of 6 on Friday around 5pm. Thought we hit the jack pot since there was only one party ahead of us in line. Little did we know the line was to be put on the waitlist, and the wait was expected to be 30mins. However, they take your phone # and ping you when the table is ready so you can walk around Washington square and check out neighboring stores! Pros:+ FOOD: It's no wonder people are willing to wait hours for their pizza. Apparently there is another location where they will take your orders for take-out but rumor has it that the food is better at the sit-down restaurant. We noticed there were several items listed as "limited #/day" but all the items were available for order when we ordered around 6pm. - Italian Salad: comes in generous portions and feeds around ~8 ppl if ordering with other entrees. - Gigantic meatball with sea salt and burrata: When meatballs from "Cloudy with a chance of meatballs" come to life. One of these comfortably fed all 6 people. The meatball was cooked to perfection neither gamey nor tough and the sauce complemented the meatball very well! - New Yorker - favorite pizza of the day! Meaty, cheesy, and crunchy from the thin crust. No wonder it won the gold medal in las vegas in 2013!- Sausage and stout - cool concept and sweet from the beer they used. It was a good mix from all the tomato based dish we had ordered, but it fell short of the New Yorker. - Margarita - it won the pizza competition in Naples but the flavor was underwhelming. The tomato base tasted a bit diluted and the cheese tasted bland. The crust and base was thin and fluffy though and I would recommend it for people who prefer simple, focused pizza. Improvements:+ limited seating inside and outdoors: we were seated outside on the hill so it felt like we were eating on a roller coaster ride that was frozen while escalating. Given the SF weather, it was pretty chilly but they had heat insulators along the innermost side of the table closest to the walls. + slow service: we had to waive down the waiter down a couple of times to get our order in. + no reservations taken + pricey for pizza Overall, there were so many options on the menu and I would advise going in big groups so you can try a variety of selections!

Updated review
Came here again on the weekend and I still love this pizza place so much. Some updates:1) For the past year or so, they have now added the text messaging for waiting in line. So they'll send you a text when your table is ready! This is super handy - the wait for us was 1 hour for an outside table, or 2 hours for inside table. We were able to kill the 1 hour easily by grabbing a drink at Comstock a few blocks down.2) I really love the New Yorker Pizza. The ingredients are: mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced Italian fennel sausage, calabrese sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano. WOW. I just love the combo of the ricotta with the sausages. It makes it sweet and soft from the ricotta cheese, but also salty and chewy with all the meats. It's $28 but is a HUGE pizza with 4 giant slices (1 slice of this, plus 1 of another pizza, will get you full). 3) It sucks sitting outside in the freezing cold of winter. They do have heat lamps, but if your table isn't under it, it sure doesn't feel like it. 4) I really hate the bathrooms here - there are only 2 single stall ones that don't specify gender. There is always a line no matter what, which sucks since the restaurant is huge. But that being said, if your table is outside, waiting in this bathroom line is great way to thaw out.

HUGE SERVICE ISSUE! We came here for my friend's birthday dinner on Memorial Day as several people said the pizza is great. I will start by saying the pizza is very good, which is why I still gave two stars instead of one. However, the night was very much hurt by the horrible service. Tony's does not take reservations, so they say to be prepared to wait 1.5-2 hours for dinner. We put our name down for 5 people and went to Joe's across the street for a glass of wine. We were told it'd likely be about a 1.5 hour wait. We were texted only about 45 minutes later saying our table was ready and that our entire party needed to be present at the hostess stand within 5 minutes or they would give away our table. We rushed to pay our bill at Joe's and also frantically called our 5th friend to hurry over because she had been expecting to not have to be there until at least 30 minutes later. Once we arrived, the hostess forgot we had 5 people and not just 4 and asked us to wait a bit. We waited an ADDITIONAL 50 minutes!!! Don't force us to rush over from across the street saying our table is ready only to force us to wait almost another hour sitting in the squished area next to the hostess stand. Finally, we are getting seated and I mention to the women that it is my friend's birthday. I ask if they can bring out a dessert for her. The woman says yes and asks if tiramisu is okay. She even makes sure to confirm which one of my friends is the birthday girl. She says she will let the waiter know. Once seated, we wait for at least 15 minutes, and no waiter comes by (not even to get us water.) By now it is past 9pm (they stop guaranteeing tables at that time even if you're on the wait list as the restaurant closed at 10.) We are hungry and inpatient. The menu can be pretty overwhelming because there are a TON of options. And for the average person, it's kind of hard to really know the difference between Detroit, New York, Sicilian, California, Grandma, and Classic Italian. We wanted help from our waiter, and we're pretty sure he was high. He was speaking so quietly and didn't seem to have much energy to help us make a decision. We ended up getting the prosciutto coccoli to start, the Cal Italia pizza, the New Yorker pizza, and a carafe of red sangria to share. The food is good however a lot of their pizzas are very saucy and me along with another of my friends don't actually like tomato sauce that much. So that was more unfortunate for us, but others did like it. The Cal Italia doesn't have tomato sauce, but I didn't really like the sticky fig preserve. The final straw however came with us being done with our food and waiting 20 more minutes. No one came by to offer a dessert menu or to pack up our leftovers or even to bring the check. The restaurant was essentially closed, and we were one of the last tables in the restaurant. Finally, I went up to our waiter to ask where our tiramisu was and to get the check. He looked at me with a blank stare and said the woman never told him about a birthday or a dessert. HELLLO ARE YOU KIDDING. Then he says needs to go and check to make sure they can still bring the dessert because the kitchen has already closed... Thankfully, they did end up bringing it out but it wasn't the best quality (kind of melted). Also, he even still charged us $8 for the dessert....I will not be coming back unless I happen to have 3.5 hours to waste while people stop by to serve me when they feel like it... I can get good pizza somewhere else without this frustration, especially on a birthday.

This is supposedly the best pizza in town. That's not actually accurate because there's no pizza oven in the place. Walked in around 9:30 Saturday night to be told there was a 2 hour wait, even though there was extensive sidewalk seating and 3 tables open inside the hot, cramped "restaurant". Just two doors down is the pizza shop that actually makes their pizzas & THAT pizza is the best pizza in town.If I come back to SF, I'll bypass this place & just go straight to the source.

The question on everyone's mind is whether or not Tony's Pizza is worth the two-hour wait. And I have to say, I think that it is.This is my second time going to this restaurant, and it did not disappoint.I highly recommend either the Detroit or the Grandma for those looking for deep dish pizza.

I like Tony's Pizza. I do. But I definitely wouldn't call it award-winning. To me, both the food and the vibe are like a better and (much) tastier version of a suburban Italian restaurant, like Macaroni Grill. I don't mean that as a diss! Who doesn't love the occasional suburban dinner?! That said, this isn't a restaurant I'd choose for a date night, or if I had guests visiting from out of town. Similar to many restaurants in the 'burbs, Tony's portions are enormous and hit the spot. During my most recent visit, hubby and I ordered the cheesy garlic bread, the lasagna and the Jersey Trenton tomato pizza with serrano peppers. The bread and lasagna were HUGE and delish. I barely made a dent in the lasagna and it lasted me three more meals at home. The pizza was tasty, but nothing to write home about. And word to the wise - the peppers were HOT.As others noted, the wait time to get a table can be outrageous (90-120 minutes), which doesn't work for me. So personally, I only hit up this spot during less busy hours or when I can quickly snag two seats at the bar. I recommend doing the same!

The food is outstanding! The wait SUCKS! We waited over an hour outside and requested they turn on the heater and waited...and waited...aaaand waited. So besides freezing our ----- off once we went in the food came out quick and was delicious. We got the New Yorker, an order of spaghetti and meatballs, and calamari. Everything tastes very fresh! The food is a bit pricey but when in San Francisco, what isn't right? Definitely a go to when in town!

The box says Eat at Tony's. Didn't think that they quite literally mean that! They should add to the tag line - Eat at Tony's, but if you order in, we might send an empty box and never accept it as our fault - because we are famous!The manager never even apologized once for this mistake. And the only option given to us was to come and pick up the missing pizza. He blamed UberEats for it as if it's the drivers fault that their kitchen forgot to put the pizza in the damn box. If it was one box, perhaps the driver would have noticed. But there were 3 boxes, so totally understand why he didn't catch it. UberEats immediately reached out and apologized, even though it clearly wasn't their fault. Regardless of what the box urges us to do, we are never Eating or Ordering from Tony's again.

When there's a long line, out the door and around the corner, IN THE RAIN... you know this place is going to be good! We waited over an hour, and when we finally got inside I noticed tons of awards covering the walls and shelves. Upon closer inspection, I saw that they were rated best pizza in the world, among other very flattering titles. After living in Rome in 2011, my Neapolitan pizza standards are very high so I couldn't wait to try this place out.Honest opinion...? ...It just might be the best. Definitely best in the US.I tried to convince myself that it wasn't, mostly because I was bitter that it was $20 for a personal pizza and I'm cheap, but it's worth it. The Margherita was exceptional. The New Yorker I didn't try but my dad said it's the best pizza he's ever had, mom said the best ricotta she's ever had...This place is an A+. Come at odd hours to avoid the line (it chilled out around 3:00) and enjoy yourself a fresh, authentic REAL Italian pizza!

I write this review, long overdue, as I remember the great times I had here. I no longer live in San Francisco (Oh... how I miss you), but my taste buds still remember this pizza, which is hands-down some of the best Pizza in California (I have lived in SF, Sacramento, and currently live in LA). When I visit SF, I make it a point to stop by Tony's and indulge in carbohydrate debauchery. The Ceasar salad is amazing, too! If you get here after 5PM, fuggedaboutit! I have had 2-hour waits for this damn place...and shamefully, I always stick the wait out.

Holy crap! I saw this place on Best Bars in America's good episode and wow! I was set on getting the Sausage and Stout Pizza, got it, ate it, and was not prepared for how good that was going to be. It took us a while to get our pizza because our ticket got lost. We weren't complaining about the time but the bartender, JP, brought us meatballs on him because of the "inconvenience". He didn't have to but that just added to the awesomeness of Tony's. JP and Lavell made the bar fun to sit at, the gesture was real nice of JP, and the pizza was just....(sigh)...delicious! The sausage and stout went well with the oatmeal stout on tap, the cocktails looked amazing...I'm definitely coming back and soon!

Background: I'm stuck at the office late most nights, so I've decided to add some joy and mindfulness to my life by reviewing the takeout I get. Live review day three! Again from the comforts of the office cube...A coworker and I got the New Yorker for dinner. Though I try to eat healthy, a pizza now and then never hurt anyone. It has all the food groups, so it must be healthy, right? Meat (usually), veggies (sometimes), dairy, wheat, and fruit (tomatoes!).Alright...moving on. The New Yorker pizza has mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced Italian fennel sausage, calabrese sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano. The pizza was definitely lighter tasting than expected. Unexpectedly, the sausage was sweet and mild tasting, which I really liked. The pepperoni also was light, as was the ricotta. The mozzarella, however, became one giant piece covering the pizza when it cooked and when it arrived, it was no longer gooey. Oh well. Still good in my opinion, but...I actually like Blaze and Round Table more. I wouldn't be opposed to getting this again, but it's not something I'd go out of my way for.My coworker insisted on getting some veggies (gotta be healthy!) so we got the Caesar salad and a side of spinach. Caesar salad was your run of the mill romaine with fancy-looking croutons and a couple pieces of whole anchovy that looked like it was thrown on just for decoration. Spinach was very oily, with a hint of lemon. I guess you don't go to a pizzeria for the veggies though.Maybe I'll stop by for the margherita with the bf one of these weekends!

Excellent food!! We were told the wait for 2 people would be 1-1.5 hours, but we were seated in 10 min, woohoo!! The seating is somewhat limited, but worth the wait.

The server was friendly as well. I'd return to try the sausage and stout beer pizza

Holy moly, this place is legit. Because we heard that there was always a wait, we made sure to get there with enough time to hang around. I consider myself somewhat of a pizza connoisseur after living in New York City for almost a decade and having amazing pizza at my fingertips. This place can rival any of those places. I just got the normal pepperoni pizza, the Tartufo pizza, and the sangria. All of which were great. I will definitely be returning to Tony's next time I am in San Fran.

This is 'different' but equally amazing.The selection and methods are what impressed me and the fetching Mrs. M..We sat at the bar (first avail) and were treated as royalty. That the gentleman serving us, is a consummate professional. I watched him watching the food coming out and literally knew what went where and made sure it got to the destination. I so appreciate professionals in food service.Now for Mrs. M's words on the pie...Lovely! Just lovely!
