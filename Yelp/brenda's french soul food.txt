Ok first off it's important to note that you WILL have a wait. That being said -- totally worth the 90 minutes we waited. The food is amazeballs -- completely full of flavor and uniquely blended. I even broke my no-meat rule and my body didn't revolt against me. It's a blast to go with friends, I highly recommend splitting the beignet flight and the grits and biscuits are sooooo good. Yeah, everything tastes and smells delicious. If you do it right, you should need to be carried out in a wheelbarrow because you'll be too full to function.

Summary: Balanced fried chicken was crispy on the outside, and very moist and juicy inside, but flavoring was a bit on the balanced side. 3.5/5Went here for lunch last Friday. The wait for 2 was 15 minutes, so not bad at all. I was looking forward to the chicken, since I had heard all the hype for quite a while now.I ordered the BFC, my wife got the gumbo. Maybe my expectations were too high...The fried chicken was above average. The good: incredibly crunchy skin, and not too oily too, which seems paradoxical but great; and very juicy and moist meat (white meat). I believe I had a drumstick and thigh. The bad: for cajun/soul food, it was kinda bland. I prefer my fried chicken salty, and the more paprika/cayenne, the better for me. I tasted the buttermilk, but to me, it was just lacking that unhealthy saltiness that fried chicken needs. I lathered it with hot sauce.On the other hand, my wife's gumbo was delicious! Rich enough, and texture was not overly thick. Loved the roux in their gumbo. And the flavors, oh my! Bold, a little spicy and delicious!The biscuit was also fantastic, crispy on the outside and very fluffy inside. Based on the fried chicken, this place gets 3.5 from me, but depending how you like your fried chicken, you might give it a 4.

We arrived on a Saturday morning at 8:10am and there was no line outside. The nearby area was a bit dodgy so I wouldn't recommended coming here on foot ( unless you want to be harassed like we did or step on needles). But If you really have to, try to stay away from the troubled Turk Street. Grits: This is what made Brenda famous! Very cheesy, delicious, and calorie-dense. Pulled pork eggs Benedict: Wow! This off-the-menu dish was such a delectable treat! The bread was buttery and pulled pork was tender and bold in flavour. I enjoyed every bite of it!! Beignet: okay..where should I start... let's just say I would not order them again. The chocolate one was way too dense and sweet and the savory one didn't taste very fresh at all.

Updated review
We visited again for and early dinner on a Saturday evening. Street parking was easy to find. Even though they have expanded the restaurant, the wait time was still significant. We put our name on the chalkboard and waited about 15 to 20 minutes for a table.DH ordered an Oyster po'boy sandwich. It was very large. The roll looked hard, but the bread was actually very soft. There was a strong horseradish flavor from the sauce. The oysters were small, but well fried. DH says, "It was good, but not as good as the catfish. I thought the horseradish was a bit much. I wish the bacon was incorporated into the cornmeal (breading). You got either bacon or oyster, not both." The fries were amazing. They had the thinnest, crispy outer layer. DH thought they were fried twice. "They had good flavor. They were really nice!"I got my usual order, which was too much food! Two BFC thighs, juicy, tasty dark meat with well seasoned skin. A side of amazing collard greens with bacon. And a biscuit the size of your head. The biscuit was crumbly on the bottom, in a good buttery crisp way. The inside so moist and tender. This time, it came with a peach chutney. Yum!We were too full, so we ordered a chocolate banana bread pudding to go. They did a great job boxing it with separate containers for the bourbon sauce and whipped cream. We microwaved it at home, warmed the sauce in a glass dish (this is a must!), and put it together. Delicious!Brenda, good thing your soul food is across the bridge. Otherwise we would be here all the time!

Like other go-to brunch joints in SF, if you're hitting this place up during prime brunch hrs (10am-1pm) bring a friend/SO whom you enjoy the company of... you'll write your name and # in your party on an old-school chalk board and wait 45-90min for them to call on you like a grade school kid. And when they do call your name, be prepared to order a beignet flight and fight your friend/SO for the middle bite of each. Expect a crisp outer shell, and soft cloud-like dough embracing an even more delicious filling. From the beignet with gooey chocolate filling (reminiscent of, but better than a chocolate filled donut) to the one filled with cheesy crawfish, these. Are. Big. Scrumptious. Balls. Of. Joy. On. A. Plate.That being said, I'm also partial towards their biscuits. So maybe I'm just a carb fiend. But I'll let you decide for yourself. They open at 8am, see you there.

You know that episode of 'The Mind of a Chef' where David Kinch makes a Po'Boy? He coats shucked oysters in a white cornmeal, panko and flour dredge and shakes off the excess. He then descends the oysters gently into a cast iron pan filled with hot oil and minutes later, removes them and places them on a paper towel. Sprinkling sea salt on top. He takes that quintessential long Leidenheimer Baking Co. Po'Boy baguette - the bread that is both light and hearty with a crust that shatters and a crumb that is tender - schmears a light layer of mayo onto the bread, then compulsively thin chiffonade of sliced cabbage and iceberg, thinly sliced tomatoes, the oysters and a few shakes of Louisiana hot sauce. And then the lid. They take a bite and the sound...the sound of the crunch of the bread and the oysters makes your mouth drool. He creates this somehow delicate and yet monster of a sandwich that is irresistible. So irresistible that they can't stop eating the sandwich and before you know it they've eaten multiple po'boys. Yeah, that ain't the Po'Boy I got at Brenda's.Oysters Casino $3.25 ea. | Bacon, scallion, biscuit crumbs, parmesan, swiss. I love clams casino. I should have asked what kind of oysters they were using because after I ordered two, to my surprise, two hulking oysters appeared at my table. Clams casino usually arrives bubbling its delicious herby cheesy gooeyness. These oysters arrived with a crumbly, bland and soggy biscuit topping that just disintegrated in the brine.Crawfish Beignets $4.00 ea. | A behemoth, big enough for two. The filling was delicious and creamy, but there wasn't enough of it. It was mostly bread. Looks pretty, but taste underwhelming.Special of the day: The Troublemaker $14.50 | A Po'Boy with fried oysters, bacon and something called "tiger sauce." Why...why didn't I ask what tiger sauce was? Why didn't it describe it on the blackboard? Tiger sauce ended up being a horseradish sauce that cleared my sinuses, while delicious, hella strong in its quantity. The amount of sauce actually ruined the sandwich because it's counterintuitive to schlep a gloopy and thick sauce directly on top of fried oysters deeming them gluey. Thick cut tomatoes, pickles and tons of shredded iceberg. I tore off pieces of bread from this clumsy sandwich, took little amounts of the sauce and ate it that way. The first oyster I ate was deliciously crispy. By the time I reached the third oyster, it was making plaster in my mouth. I ended up leaving most of the sandwich.Fried chicken thigh $3.25 | Why did my chicken have a bald spot on top? The edges were fried perfectly, but the top was soft and supple like the colonel's original recipe. Is it supposed to be this way? The chicken did have a lot of flavor, which is often not the case with most fried chickens. The skin is the best part of fried chicken! Cream biscuit | There's something else in this biscuit. An underlying flavor. Maybe cinnamon. You can definitely taste the cream and the biscuits are just as tender and light as can be. But, when I went to grab the top portion of my biscuit, it just shattered to the touch. Fortunately, the bottom was still intact, sturdy and crispy. I slathered butter and homemade preserves. Service was amazing. I had a very intuitive and non-invasive server. She ended up not charging me for the oysters which I thought was incredibly kind. I had Brenda's bookmarked for years! And I was feeling pretty down today, which led me to treat myself to a good meal. But, this wasn't the meal that made me forget about my troubles or made it worth showering and coming outside for. Luckily, the prices are relatively affordable and the portions large. Unfortunately, I just don't see a need to be back.

AMAZING! This has got to be my favourite brunch place. Ever. I'll have to thank my friend for the recommendation 10x over. I read that it gets busy so be prepared to line up. We were super lucky this past Wednesday and arrived shortly after 10. Didn't have to wait for a table at all. When we left around 11:30, there was a lineup for the lunch slot. The ambience is amazing. Paintings on the walls, character mirrors hanging everywhere and service is fantastic. I had to try the traditional beignets. And they are beyond delicious. fried to a perfect golden brown. Crispy on the outside. Pillowy softness on the inside with a slight sweetness to them. Comes 3 to an order.. I ate 2. I could have eaten more but I needed to leave room for my main. I ordered the shrimp and grits.. wow. Just WOW. I haven't had that much shrimp and grits to compare it to(southern food is hard to find in Canada) but they set the bar ridiculously high. Creamy, buttery and jam packed with flavour. And a ton of shrimps too! The spicy tomato jam just puts the cherry on top. I wish I was eating a bowl right now to be honest. Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely coming back here. Loveeeeeeee it!

I've always been told to avoid the Tenderloins, but had to try this place! I've been here three times always (2 for brunch and once for dinner).Some standouts:-Crawfish beignets: This is probably a must at Brenda's! The breeding is good. Inside, it's creamy and there was a good amount of crawfish.-BFC: Fried chicken. Yum! Perfectly seasoned and juicy. I couldn't finish this so brought half home. It was still good the next day.-Shrimp & Grits: My first time having grits was actually here. I didn't know what to expect but fell in love with this dish. So many flavors and super cheesy. Now, I am sad that I can't eat it bc I'm lactose intolerant. Still, I do recommend this dish to my friends.Service is okay. Wait can be long depending when you go. You write your name on the chalkboard. They do not take reservations!

Fantastic resaurant. Came here after have one to many drinks at Dolores and the food was amazing! I got luck and got here right before the rush which was perfect because right after there was at least a 45 minute wait. I got the shrimp and grits (fucking out of this world) and the beignet's (also from mars or some shit). Both were probably the best thing ive put in my mouth this year. With out going into to much, go try this place. seriously. Off of my one time here so far its definetly worth the visit

It honestly makes me a little sad to write this review because I had such high expectations. I originally really wanted to try the fried catfish benedict and was looking forward to it for weeks. I found out a few days before my sf trip that they only serve it on weekends and my trip was only from tues-thurs. As disappointed as I was, I still wanted to try the place out since it is one of the highest reviewed restaurants in sf. We came pretty late on a Wednesday night and only had to wait maybe 5-10 minutes.I ended up getting the shrimp n grits (nothing else on the menu was really that appealing to me), my bf got the special of the night which was a creole shrimp pot pie, and we also got 2 crawfish beignets plus a mac n cheese. I'd never had grits before but I figured it had to be good, seeing all the reviews about it. All I can say is it definitely lived up to the hype. It was delicious, super creamy and flavorful, I loved everything about it and I would recommend it to anyone!! However, this was pretty much the only thing I enjoyed of the night. The beignets were good, but I honestly had higher expectations. My bf's pot pie was literally horrible, it was SO salty. I couldn't even believe they would serve something like that. The mac n cheese was also very whatever. I can see how they tried to be different with it, but honestly the flavor was just bland and got boring real quick.I would come back here in the future to try out the benedicts for sure, and I would get the shrimp and grits again. Other than that, I don't really see anything else going for this place. The service was so whatever and the food is kinda pricey. It's a nice place to try out once or twice, but if I were a local, I wouldn't really see myself coming back. Plus, everyone says there's always a long line, I guess we got lucky this time but I definitely would not wait 1 hr+ for this.

Everything we tried here was delicious! The servers were efficient and friendly. We ate chocolate beignets, shrimp and grits, and eggs Benedict with fried chicken. The molten chocolate was amazing and a yummy treat while we waited for our food. They also have a beignet sampler plate with smaller beignets so you can try them all. I've only tried the apple and chocolate ones, but would be curious to try the savory ones next time. Word to the wise, get there early to put your name on the chalkboard (which is their waiting list), or go during off hours between lunch and dinner. The line are pretty crazy on weekends. My friend and I put our names on the list and went to Peet's to hang out because our wait was over 45 minutes.

.:after being asked if I tried Brenda's in SF I can now say YES:. After waiting close to 30 minutes we finally got to put in our order for pork belly cheesy grits with the BFC and beignet sampler. NOTE: Ask to have the beignets after to make sure u don't get full prior your main meal comes out. The Beignets are super filling chocolate one is like nutella melting with the warm doughy innards of the beignet. Not as soft as I expected but it's got flavor like no other. The BFC was good and when you add the Crystal hot sauce pow the moistened of the white meat held the spicy perfectly. Overall kinda what I expected but since there was a huge hype to try it I was expecting A LOT. Hella outsiders come here, would advise to just be prepared to wait and just try the food to have your own opinion. Overall fulfilling meal with good flavors. #schmackin #goodeats #nomnomnom #bestfoodbayarea

Had this place bookmarked for a long time and today got to try. I ordered to go since the wait outside was an hour and half and I really didn't need to dine here. I really just picked items that had over 1000 reviews from yelp and all were satisfying. Crawfish beignets, sweet beignets and also the shrimp & grits. I liked the crawfish beignets the best. Just had a wonderful flavor and it came really hot in my bag. I was even surprised at how they packaged the grits. Double boxed so no leakage. I was bummed though they didn't serve the bfcs till later in the afternoon. I would definitely come back here and next time I would still take it for takeout. I did have to call twice though since the lines were busy but no issues there. Might try some of the other items next time.

The beignet flight will seriously change your life! My favorite was the crawfish beignet. Yes. You're reading this right. It's an awesome southern twist to your usual sweet treat. We shared the fried chicken and biscuits. The chicken was very crispy, juicy, savory. The biscuits are soft and fluffy. All of their portions are very reasonable-- the po boy was literally the size of a watermelon! You can't go wrong with ordering anything!

Came here with a bunch of friends for Saturday brunch and the line was super long and we ended up waiting for about an hour before eating. While the food was good, this will more likely be a one time kind of experience just cause the wait isn't really worth it, despite the food being pretty good.I had the crawfish beignets and shrimp grits and both were delicious. The beignets were nice and soft on the inside while having a nice crispy texture on the outside. The flavor was delicious as well.The shrimp grits have a nice tomatoey taste with a touch of spiciness that came together really well. I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed it given that I haven't been a big fan of grits. And the cheese layer on top just added really well, all the pieces came together quite nicely.Overall a great food place, but not worth the wait. If there was no wait I could see myself coming back often but with that insane line, it just isn't worth it.

I had been avoiding Brenda's after hearing about the ridiculous wait times, but found myself in the area at 8:30am, awake. Perfect. After having breakfast here, I can definitely understand the hype about this place. Coming early is definitely the way to go, as line started forming by the door around 9am on a Saturday. As they say, the early bird gets the crawfish beignets... wait, is that not how it goes?Boyfriend and I walked in and were seated right away. Service was super speedy. Boyfriend ordered the pork belly on cheesy grits and I had the crawfish beignets. I couldn't not order them after seeing photo after photo of those deliciously gooey treats. We loved both our dishes. The only thing I suggest is ordering just one of the beignets because they are rather large, and you get three in one order! I didn't know that was an option, but will definitely do that in the future just to try several varieties.

It was a cold night in Union Square while traveling for work, when i stumbled upon Brenda's French Soul Food on Yelp. In the beginning i wasn't sure if it was worth the walk since it was about a little more than half a mile. But boy did i make the right decision in coming here! Warning: Not a safe walk from Union square to Brenda's.As soon as you walk in, the restaurant itself already has a new orleans-esq ambiance. the menu is just perfectly filled with dishes that fit the mood. The Cheese Crawfish Beignets here are a must try! Huge in size, filled with cheese, crawfish, and scallions, this savory beignet at Brenda's are absolutely to die for at a price tag of $3.50/per. I also had an order of the Catfish De Allemands as the main entree, which is pretty much a combination of catfish and crawfish etouffe. With a combination of the rice pilaf, the etouffe was perfectly seasoned and cooked coming at a price tag of $16.75 which is reasonable in my opinion. Im not sure about parking here, but my recommendation would be to uber here since the area doesn't seem too safe. I will absolutely be making a trip back here during my next stay in SF.

This place is absolutely spectacular! If I could, I would add 5 more stars!Every time I go see a musical in the Orpheum Theater, or feeling hella bougie, I go to this place. My absolute favorite to get at this place are the beignets. My first time here, I was on a horrible date! As soon as I took a bite of the crawfish beignets, it helped me cope with the rest of the night. Did I mention this was also the place I took my now boyfriend for our 2nd date? So, Brenda's is not only a food joint, but a place to find a man!Anyways...As for other food on the menu, the menu consist of southern, soul food staples (gumbo, grits, catfish, etc.). I tried their fried chicken and cheesy grits and they were really good. Their biscuits are a must order every time you come here! The dishes I've tried here are all delicious, fresh, and made with a lot SOUL! You can tell each plate of food was made to order as they come to your table. The price is moderate, it's a typical price for dinner in SF. Meal ranges from $10-$20. Beignet's are $3.50 each.Besides the amazing food, what really won me over was the whole feel, atmosphere, and decor of this place. It's like I've been transported to Louisiana. Brenda's feel is very classy yet casual. It's loud here, and tables are close together, but that's what gives it its charm. The lighting at night makes it seem as though I'm in Tiana's restaurant in Princess in the Frog! There's also a jazz/soul band that plays here occasionally. I mean seriously? I'm practically a Disney princess!As for cons, it's so popular, the wait time can be up to 45 minutes to an hour. You have to write your name down on the chalk board by the entrance. The waiting area is also cramped, so it's best to wait outside. Service can be better, but usually service lags on their busiest hours, so bare with them. But let's be honest, I'm nitpicking for cons!

Brenda's is definitely good but not something I would absolutely have to come back for. I liked their shrimp and grits but they weren't the best I've ever had. The crawfish beignets weren't as great as I've heard them to be.. not that flavorful and I would much rather have the regular powdered beignet.The fried chicken was also good but I would pass next time also.The Bloody Mary was excellent here! So so good. If I come back, I'd get this and the beignets for sure. Service was also great. Everyone was very friendly.

"Dense, not fluffy. Was okay," another yelper said about their beignets--a perfect way to describe the crawfish beignets my friend and I shared. The filling inside was delicious, not that much actual crawfish but the sauce and taste were great. Unfortunately, the outside dough/bread part or whatever you wanna call it was not. Like bad pizza crust, you nibble and leave the rest for someone who likes cardboard. I think we waited about 30-45mins. Not bad and I would say maybe that's the max wait this place is worth. They made some sort of homemade iced tea that was really good, and they had a decent Benedict, yet again, potatoes were D-E-N-S-E and tasted bland. If I could do it all over again, I would have chosen a sampler plate of beignets to try some of the sweeter options instead of getting bored on crawfish ones. The sauces, flavor, and iced tea were great, and exemplify potential, but the other elements just missed the mark.

Crawfish beignets for the way! (3 for $12)^ the portions of these are huge and I would actually count them more of a side item than a appetizer. I would say these are about 4in in height and there's 3 of these so order smart!why I said order smart is because bb and I could have easily shared one entree and split these beignets and have it be a meal amongst us, but we'll rmb for next time hahaI ordered the fried chicken eggs benedict($14) and this was delicious, I would totally get this. Bb got the hangtown fry($15) and this was another popular item but unfortunately it wasn't his cup of tea. each of our meals came with potatoes(these were yummy) and bb's meal came with toast too.Parking is ok to find around this area. on a Sunday we arrived at 1:30pm and the wait felt like a 45min for 2ppl. the items aren't cheap so order smart. would recommend this place and will be back!

The chicken was nice and crispy but lacked flavor. The fries were really gross. How can you go wrong with fries?I ordered the grits and shrimp. The sauce was on the sweeter side, I didn't like it that much. As for their expensive beignets, they were more like doughnuts. Not fluff poofs. Very disappointing. I miss New Orleans......Serving sizes were perfect but I didn't see what all the hype was for.

The place was crowded for brunch so we ordered the crawfish beignets to-go. I've done this the last come of times because I just hate wait. One order of the crawfish comes with 3 beignets for $12. $4 for each one isn't bad and I kind of like the take-out method because you don't have to worry about tip and such. Parking is also a hassle so the grab and go is the way for me.The crawfish beignets are fantastic. The outside is fluffy and the inside has a good amount of crawfish tails with that cream sauce. I do feel that it's a little doughy but it's still really good. I've yet to try anything else here but right now I'm good with just these beignets. One of these days when it's not as crowded I'll sit down to enjoy their shrimp and grits as the pictures on yelp look incredible.

Usually I give 4 stars for restaurants with waits that really aren't worth the hype, but this was something different. We waited about an hour for a group of 7 on a Sunday morning, but quick service made the experience worthwhile. We had the flight of beignets which were all amazing. Especially the crayfish, albeit they're all very heavy so don't plan on this being anymore than something to pass around after a few bites. We also had the Shrimp n Grits which was fantastic. I always wondered why Paula Dean was so hyped on grits but they really soak in a lot of flavor. Just a warning, these are loaded in cheese, and it's amazing. Would definitely come back here again, and again, as again.

Brenda's is a half step above a hole in the wall. It's surrounded by homeless people and urine soaked sidewalks, but the food is pretty damn good. I'm not sure we got the typical 'BSF' experience based on reading all the other reviews, but it was still a great meal. We came in the late afternoon and got seated immediately thank God. Our server, and the other servers based on my observations, weren't the friendliest people in the world. But the got the job done. The coffee (Community Coffee) is probably my favorite brand. Smooth, silky, and light. I ordered the french toast against my servers advice and I'm glad I did. Very sweet but with a good depth of flavor. The pecan spread it came with was money. Obviously the beignets are bomb. We didn't like the crawfish one, super fishy, but the rest were really good. The chocolate in the chocolate beignet was delicious. Rich and creamy. Also ordered two drumsticks on the side. They were really freakin good. I love the breading they use. It's got a very slight hint of spice that I've never had before. Highly recommend the fried chicken. Pumpkin pancake that was on special sucked. Like literally not good at all. It tasted like semi sweet Play Doh and had the same consistency. I had like two bites of it. Thumbs downAtmosphere was cool. Food was good. Service was eh. Here's my overall ratings:Atmosphere- 4/5Service- 2.5/5Quality/value- 3.5/5Food- 4/5Coffee- 4.5/5

Was super excited to come to this place but my expectations fell short :( Came with one of my friends on a Tuesday and there wasn't a wait, so we got seated right away. Although we got seated right away, we still had to wait about ten minutes for a server to tend to us, quite annoying. I ended up ordering an omelette and my friend ordered grits. My friend's grits were pretty tasty- the two stars are solely for that. However, my omelette was a disaster. I really have no clue what it was, but the eggs in the omelette tasted rancid? The potatoes weren't my favorite either, just weird flavors all along.Also, be aware that Brenda's is located in the Tenderloin. It's no biggie for me, but if you aren't comfortable with a slew of homeless people then don't come here.

What's better than getting Brenda's on a weekday? Not having to wait in line for 30+ minutes to eat Brenda's on a weekday. Seriously, one of the most popular brunch spots in SF and a group of 7 only had to stand around outside the 'Loin for 10 minutes? I've eaten dinner at Brenda's before, but never had the willpower to wait it out through the brunch rush. It was a magical Friday right off the bat.Sparkling rose. Beignets. Grits. Seafood frittata. Bacon. These are the words that make the birds sing. And my heart melt. Probably also causes diabetes if enjoyed every day. But hey, that's why it's a special treat.

I highly recommend starting your day with a crawfish beignet. The fluffy french dough stuffed with spiced with cayenne, scallions & cheddar will make you super unproductive but incredibly happy. But let's back up. I was in town visiting, and I had Brenda's bookmarked ahead of time. On a weekday at lunch, there was a line of people waiting to get in. But since I was a loserly party of one, I got a seat at the "bar" within a few minutes. I quickly ordered a single crawfish beignet and reveled in the most comfy comfort food. It was literally bursting with flavor. After debating over my main course, my server suggested Brenda's Fried Chicken. The BFC came with fries, coleslaw, cream biscuit, and pickled watermelon rind. I was impressed with how juicy and crispy the chicken was! I did think it could use a little more seasoning, though. The cream biscuit was pretty ridiculous and I loved piling on the chicken, apricot (or peach) preserves, and a drop of Louisiana hot sauce. Service got pretty slow but they were busy.Like an a-hole, I showed my SF friends photos of my brunch while they worked. Needless to say they added Brenda's to their list asap.

I haven't had good food in a really long time and Brenda's was one of the top restaurants where I experienced one of the best foods in my life. I got the beignet flight and BFC. The beignet flight is basically one of each beignet offered on the menu (plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish). In all honestly, I should have went with my friend's recommendation and only get the crawfish beignet. The crawfish beignet was out of this world and taste so, so good. The plani, chocolate, and apple beignet can pass as it wasn't the best I've had and felt like I've had better. The crawfish on the other hand, was just so good. The BFC comes with a fried chicken thigh (1) and a drumstick (1) with a side of seasoned fries and cole slaw. It costed $13 for the BFC and $12 for the beignet flight. I came here on a weekday and waited about less than 15 minutes for 2 people. The line went by pretty fast. We wanted to order the eggs benedict (saw pictures located on yelp) but found out that was only offered during the weekend. Service was OK and the food took kind of long to come out. Overall, I will definitely come back here just to eat the crawfish beignets because I felt that was the best item here. Considering this is SF, parking can be a pain to find. If anything I would just order the crawfish beignets togo if the line is too long.

Another great recommendation from a local and a short walk from our hotel. We were there on 7/21/17 and only waited about 20 minutes for a table. The place is pretty unique - there is a huge crack in the wall from floor to ceiling and the walls are unpainted brick with some cool artwork.Wait staff is competent and friendly - important when you are in a place that seems to be perpetually on fast-forward. Our meals were excellent - again, amazing potatoes! The Hangtown Fry is something you will not see in many restaurants. If you like food with a creole flavor, this is the place for you.

We came during a week day off time and it was the perfect time. No wait and quick service. A bit too much sauce on my delicious shrimp po boy. I would ask for the sauce on the side next time. I would also come back to try the beignets, the anniversary strawberry shortcake beignets looked incredible.

Legendary Brenda's. It's only taken close to 6 years of having you on my bookmark list to get here. ANDDDD, sadly, a bit of a let down. I would normally wait until I return a 2nd time to leave a review, but, location and my fist experience, I realized I probs won't return, unless it's at someone else's request.For how busy this spot is, service is really great. Our party of 7 on a Thursday morning at 1130 was seated within 30 minutes. AMAZING.Those beignets are HUGE, and minus the apple (we ordered the flight), so good. A definite order, if I do say so myself. What I really didn't love was my fried oyster scramble. Those oysters were swampy, yo. I don't want to say they were rotten, but man, they were not delicious and fresh. My friend also ordered it and agreed. Yet, our waitress said nothing when she picked up our plates that clearly showed there was a problem - we literally ate the small amount of egg surrounding the fishy little balls. Yes, we could have said something, but I mean, eh, we were a party of 7, and at the end of the day, wrong order.The biscuit was delicious and the portions are HUGE for the price. I mean, this is San Francisco, I was expecting teeny.Heavy food, not the most relaxing (they don't kick you out, but they definitely make it known they don't want ya chilling too long, and I mean, there's always people waiting, don't be a dick), and that really unsatisfying dish equals a check off the list. I'm sure the other eats live up to the hype (that muffaletta looked real good), but sadly, I got too much other eats to eat!

I'm usually firmly in the anything over a 30 minute wait for brunch is dumb crowd, but Brenda's is definitely the exception. They have a chalk board to write your name and number of your party on inside the entrance which makes waiting for brunch a spectator sport- who will go next and take home the gold?! Are we the next large party? All possible to determine with a transparent system for tracking the wait. Once you're seated, the food you're brought is other-worldly. The biscuits and fried chicken on the eggs Benedict are both perfectly done, and my biscuits were that rare perfect combination of moist and crumbly. Divine. Eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise on top with a little kick really rounded it out. I also tried the beignet flight this time- that on it's own would be a satisfying brunch for two people. Only had room for the Crawfish and chocolate options this time but they were dynamite! Crawfish was savory and just a little spicy while the chocolate wasn't overly sweet. I'll certainly be back, the only thing that would make the experience better would be a shorter wait!

Breakfast for breakfast, breakfast for lunch, breakfast for dinner: only at Brenda's. If you're craving breakfast at random times during the day, this place is for you. My friends and I had a major sweet tooth so we ordered both the cinnamon apple and chocolate beignets along with an entree for each of us. Between the three of us, that was more than enough food. The portions here are massive, which is why you might feel that it's a bit pricey. It is pricey, but it's filling. The chocolate beignet was a bit overwhelming but it was really yummy just cause it was so fresh. It was chock-full of chocolate so it made it really sweet. Our favorite of the night was the cinnamon apple because it had the perfect balance! By the time our entrees were here, we were already full from the beignets and the food was barely touched. I ordered just a basic egg, potatoes, and biscuit plate, which I found to be just average since it's typical breakfast/diner food. Nothing too special.I'd definitely come back here for the beignets. There was quite a wait (~40 minutes) even though we showed up around 4:30, it was already packed. Next time, I might consider just ordering to-go!

After giving up trying to try this spot my first time in SF (defeated by the intimidatingly long line), I finally got to try Brenda's and it was pretty damn good! This time, we got there around 9am and were seated immediately. We didn't want a heavy meal so we only got two things: shrimp and grits and beignets (crawfish and chocolate).The shrimp and grits were so cheesy and savory. It was a really rich dish that got overwhelming at times. Definitely glad I had my boyfriend to share this with because I wouldn't have been able to eat it myself! The shrimps were juicy and the grits were a great consistency.For the beignets, we chose to get two individuals instead of opting for the flight - good decision, we wouldn't have been able to finish! Chocolate was super rich and sweet. Pretty sure they used dark chocolate, my favorite. The crawfish, though, was worth the hype! We had thick chunks of crawfish in our beignets and it was just incredibly warm and comforting. The exterior of the beignets were a little too fried for me. I'm more used to a softer exterior. But all in all, our meal at Brenda's was one to remember.

When the waitress came to our table the best first intro words ever came out of her mouth, "Coffee?" I loved it! Ghirardelli chocolate stuffed beignets were awesome!!! It's like an elephant year but way better! Egg & Bacon tartine was fantastic with a side of well seasoned hash. Large enough portion that I couldn't finish. Husband had the Andouille sausage & Cheddar omelette which he kept insisting could not possibly taste better than what I picked lol Oh and the Waitress just keeps coming with free coffee refills which I couldn't refuse.Delicious food & wonderful service!

I had REALLY high expectations coming to Brenda's as so many people say good things about it! But overall, I thought the food was just-OK, the staff was not friendly, and (it might have just been us), but the wine tasted skunked. (Again, not the place you expect good wine, but it was akin to Trader Joe's $2-buck chuck) Crawfish Beniets 2/5--Might have just been a bad one, but it was really really doughy on the inside and didn't taste cooked all the way through. Fried Chicken 2/5--The breading on the fried chicken was very hard... more rock-like when you bit into it. Unlike the fried chicken breading I typically gravitate to which is crispier, flakier, and more melt-in-your mouth--Brenda's was not those things. Mac and Cheese-- 5/5 amazing! Loved their Mac and Cheese. It was warm, it was gooey, it was cheesy, and above all things, it was delicious. Catfish Po Boy 3/5--Catfish was tasty and the bread was fresh, however they overloaded it with sauce which made the sandwich messy and it fell apart easily. It was hard to eat without the insides falling out and making a mess all over your lap. Collard Greens 5/5--They make some tasty collard greens at Brenda's! A side dish I would recommend! Having spent a lot of time in the South, I REALLY wanted to love Brenda's. We might have just gotten the wrong dishes, but overall, I felt that Brenda's did not live up to the much-anticipated hype.

The place is a little over hyped. The food is average - not the best and the servers here didn't seem to know what's being offered with what. Also the neighborhood seems a bit shady - if u tend to get scared easily then be very careful - not the kind of area for girls walking around alone. The chocolate beignets were nice and something different - it was nice soft and chocolaty but the sugar on the top makes it way too sweet. I liked the grits a lot - that's a must try item here.

8000+ reviews... hyped up from Yelp and friends yet I am still trying to understand why this place is so sought after. I just don't get it lol. Came here for brunch on a Friday and the place was relatively busy with no wait time. First off, the service was SO rude. Our server, the women with dark hair and straight bangs, kept rolling her eyes as she was taking our order. It was our first time here. Sure, maybe we were indecisive, but instead of rolling your eyes at us, maybe you should suggest something for us to get instead. Instead of blatantly saying (while eye rolling) "I'm gonna go refill some waters." Try saying, "Do you guys need more time?" Just some tips for you girl, you should try it out! Anyways... on to the food. BEIGNET FLIGHTWe opted for 2 crawfish, chocolate and a plain beignet. Although the crawfish/ filling was flavorful, the beignet was too doughy and heavy for my liking. PORK BELLY GRITS This was probably my favorite dish out of the three. The pork belly paired with the grits was delicious. However, the shrimp and grits probably would've been the better choice. OYSTER PO BOYGaddamn, the portion was HUMONGOUS. The oysters were SUPER briny. Not sure if it was overtly pungent in a bad way. We also didn't enjoy the breading on the oysters. It came with a side of nicely crisp fries and a small side of pickled watermelon rinds. Although I'm glad I got to try this place out, I would not come back. The amount of hype this place gets is overrated.

Really cool vibe with some good food!Came here on a Monday morning (Columbus Day) and expected a huge crowd based on reviews. Wrote our name on the oversized chalk board and crossed our fingers... low and behold, we were seated within 10 minutes!Of course, had to try the crawfish beignets. Not your run of the mill beignet for sure.. its huge! Imagine a pork bun from your dim sum joint. The bread was perfectly cooked.. crunchy on the outside shell and chewy dough on the inside. The Crawfish filling was great.. just wish there was more. We ate through the center fillings and left over the outer bread to leave room in our tummys for the rest of brunch. The shrimp benedicts were also great! The hollandaise sauce was tasty and the biscuits were perfectly cooked.Atmosphere was really open and cool. Rustic, industrial type feel that was very casual. Service was my only gripe. The waitress who took care of us was a bit short. For such a good experience, she left us with a less than appreciated feeling when she literally snagged the check and credit card out of our hands to go process... Nonetheless, I'd recommend the place!

If its your first time coming here my recommendations would be to order the flight of beignets, shrimp and grits, and their fried chicken eggs benedict. The food here meets up to the hype, and you can tell with the quality and time they put into making the dishes. The beignets were much bigger than I expected, especially since we ordered the flight we thought we were going to just get some small beignets. However expect 4 handsized ones when you order it and make sure you order different types!I never thought about a savory beignet and it was really delicious. It oozed out its creamy seafood crawfish goodness which was mixed with some green onions and cheese. It's a beignet you would definitely want to cut into and devour. Their grits here are very hearty, with its soft and creamy grits, along with the sweetness coming from the tomatoes and the smoky bacon. All a good mix with the shrimp. Their pork belly grits are really well done as well, the pork belly isn't soft but more steaky and I think works well with the dish because you already have creamy grits. They bake cheese on top of it so the plate is warm when you receive it. The fried chicken eggs benedict were poached perfectly and I love the money shot you get when you cut open the egg and the yolk just oozes right out on the biscuit and chicken. Chicken was light and crispy as it came with the hollandaise sauce. Wait time can be pretty long depending on your party size I would def come here a bit earlier than normal just to allocate for the wait time. Def coming back here when i'm in SF again!

I've been dying to try Brenda's for years ever since my best friend visited SF and raved about the food here. I'll admit, the walk through the tenderloin to get here was not particularly enjoyable so I highly recommend taking an Uber or Lyft if possible.Its true, they serve food that feeds the SOUL. We ordered:Crawfish beignet - FYI, their beignets are HUGE. One was enough to share between the two of us as an appetizer. IT WAS SO GOOD. Soft, warm, and filled with cheesy crawfish goodness. Can't come to Brenda's without trying this delicious monster beignet!Fried chicken - Our waitress told us this was one of the most popular items on the menu. I'm not much of a fried chicken person and this didn't really make much of an impression on me. Came with collared greens and a biscuit, along with a couple sauces for the chicken and the biscuit. Shrimp & grits - Completely BLEW ME AWAY. This unassuming dish of grits doesn't look impressive but it tastes freaking INCREDIBLE. Hearty without being heavy, with bold flavors that will knock your socks off. I literally had to resist the urge to lick the bowl at the end of our meal.Overall, this was hands down the best restaurant I visited during my short trip to SF. A great place to stop by for feel-good food after a long day. Highly recommend for natives and visitors alike!

My dietary needs are complicated, to say the least. Let's just say that I'm basically allergic to life, but more specifically, milk & gluten. That, in addition to my recently adopted, plant-based diet have limited my dining out options to under-seasoned, side-sized portions at non-vegetarian or vegan restaurants.At Risbo, my vegetarian meal didn't look or taste like an afterthought. It felt like it was made with the same love put into the meat based entrees. For $20, I was able to have 5 full sized, perfectly seasoned portions. The amount of food I received coupled with the ambience had me feeling like I owed them more. The music and staff are reflective of the surrounding community and the vibes feel familial. The communal style seating felt as if I'd had an impromptu Friendsgiving with a table full of new friends. Last, but not least, the design/decor both indoor and in the garden are gorgeous! The outdoor space is serene and cozy like something I've pinned on Pinterest. I'd recommend the meat, plant and decor lovers, but also for large groups of friends and families.

Come at 8:30AM and there won't be a wait for a small group. We ordered the special, pulled pork Benedict and the Hangtown Fry. We also ordered the Crawfish beignet. This was for two-people. The crawfish beignet is a savory one. IT IS DELICIOUS. When you cut into it, the filling oozes out. There are quite a few crawfish pieces in it as well. Half of one was already filling. This dish is pretty heavy and we took the other two to-go. The Pulled pork Benedict was also very good. I ordered it with the side of hash. I personally was not a fan of how the potatoes were made. The seasoning was good, but the potatoes weren't crispy enough. Too mushy for my preference. The biscuit on the Benedict was very flaky and the pulled pork melts in your mouth. The hangtown fry. Oysters in almost every bite!! It did seem like the eggs were a bit over cooked, but it was still good none the less. Service here was okay. I noticed that the servers will keep coffee cups and water cups filled. However, I had a cup of hot water and this requires a call to the server to keep the cup filled. If you have leftovers, they will pack it up for you. Didn't get to try the fried chicken, and will come back to try it.

Arrived around 9 am and didn't have to wait too long, maybe 30 minutes? However, a few minutes after we put our name down, the ENTIRE board filled with names so make sure you don't come too late in the morning.The portions are humongous so I ordered 3 things to share amongst 4 people family style. The food came fast after I ordered, so after you sit down you don't need to wait much longer. I ordered the:Crawfish beignet- Doughy pastry filled with globs of cheese and crawfish. When you bite into it the filling oozes out with yummy goodness. It comes with 3 and they're about the size of my palm. Shrimp and grits- Wow. After reading all the Yelp reviews about it I knew I had to get it but I really didn't expect it to be *that* good. But it really was just that good. It was so creamy and cheesy with a decent amount of shrimp. A must get at Brenda's.Banana foster French toast- This was a special so it isn't on the main menu. I doubt most people can finish the amount of toast they give. It wasn't amazing but it still tasted solid. The bananas and whipped cream were a nice touch. Probably one of the nicer French toasts I've had. If you eat at Brenda's be prepared to wait and come on an empty stomach because you will leave very very full.

The curse of the bay leaf lives on... I had a small family get-together for my birthday at Brenda's. Even though the place was packed, we were seated within ten minutes. The menu looked amazing, especially the beignets. However, they were over four dollars apiece, so we decided on hushpuppies instead, which came four to an order. They were decently sized, and tasted great. I ordered the Red Beans & Rice - Oh So Nice!, which was in fact, oh so nice. The red beans and the rice tasted great, but my favorite thing about the dish was the big, split andouille sausage that lay in the middle. The only downside to the meal was the addition of two bay leaves that I pulled from the stew; thus, the Curse of the Bay Leaf continues. I was also able to sample the shrimp and grits. Even though my dish tasted good, it was nothing compared to the shrimp and grits. Huge pieces of shrimp swimming in a pool of the cheesiest, tastiest grits I have ever had. I had the Creole Bloody Mary, which is as good as it sounds. The pickled okra was a great touch, and the creole salted rim was awesome. Other than that it was one of the best Bloody Mary's I've had. The service was very nice and friendly, and even though the place was crowded, it didn't feel over-crowded.I'm already looking forward to my next trip.

Brenda's is truly San Francisco's soul food gem. Sure, you can find $1 beignets at Devil's Teeth and Cajun crawfish at Swamp on Geary, but in all honestly, nothing beats an 11am brunch at Brenda's.If it's your first time here, these are the must gets in order of importance/tastiness: Crawfish Beignets, Shrimp n Grits, the Fried shrimp po'boy and Watermelon Iced Tea (free refills!!). The crawfish beignets are dusted in a savory red spice and the inside is warm and gooey with cheese and crawfish. On one hand, you could order the beignet flight and get your share of savory and sweet. But then, mind you, you risk fighting over the tastiest crawfish beignet you'll ever try. That's why I always order three crawfish beignets.The shrimp n grits is also warm, cheesy, and with the right amount of tomato flavor in the shrimp sauce. It pairs well with the extra biscuit (the biscuit, however, is an extra 3$). I love the fried shrimp po'boy because Brenda's gives plenty of shrimp and the sandwich sauce is so creamy and amazing. Also, the watermelon tea is a great way to wash down the saltiness from the cheese and the oil from the fried dishes while simultaneously satisfying your sweet tooth. And who can say no to free refills?Seriously come to Brenda's, the hype is very real.

WOW 8000+ reviews and averaging a 4 star... must be good. Like many other people, I've had Brenda's bookmarked for years and never got around to having brunch here because of long wait times. I finally got enough courage to try Brenda's on a Saturday and arrived around 10am via Uber. Read the house rules when you arrive. You put your name down on a waitlist chalkboard. I was on the 3rd page of the board and they were working on the beginning of the 2nd page. I asked the kind hostess her guestimate of the wait and she said 40 minutes. Not bad at all for brunch in SF, that is like normal wait time. Thanks yelpers who suggest to go before 10AM!We ordered the crawfish beignets, shrimp and grits, and eggs benedict with fried chicken. For drinks I got a cafe au lait to remind me of the time at Cafe Du Monde and my boyfriend ordered the watermelon ice tea. I was really debating on whether to get the beignet sampler or the crawfish one and decided to just get crawfish because of the raving reviews and I've had the best beignets ever already in New Orleans. These are amazingly unique. Not sure where you can get this anywhere else. In the middle of the cajun seasoning dusted beignet is cheese, peppers, and crawfish. The shrimp and grits is packed with flavor (best dish we ordered). I had to cut the powerful flavor of the grits with my plain side grits. I was disappointed with the eggs benedict because of the fried chicken. I thought I could get pieces of fried chicken with bone but it's like a chicken tender with a corn meal batter. Besides the chicken let down the poached egg and cajun hollandaise sauce were delicious. The biscuit was a bit too thick for me.Overall very tasty and heavy food with great service. Not sure I will come here too often, I still prefer sweet brunch over savory but if any of my friends want to try I definitely wouldn't stop them.

We came in on a Wednesday morning for brunch.. NO WAIT!!! Compared to the 2hr Saturday wait, I'd definitely come here on a weekday if possible. Parking was also really easy, just paid for metered parking down the street.I ordered the Hangtown Fry, which was eggs scrambled with oysters and bacon. Also comes with extras.. so I got it with grits and a biscuit. Everyone was raving about the Crawfish Beignet (3 for $12) Definitely recommend both of these!Also ordered a Bloody Mary. Wasn't as appealing as it could've been, but surprisingly very delicious!Service was okay. Had to flag down the waitress a few times, but we got everything we needed!

What you need to know: - Thursday morning at 10:30am and there was absolutely no wait. - They serve breakfast up until 3pm and lunch items start at 11am - great opportunity to try lots of food items! - Chef Brenda grew up near New Orleans, Louisiana and her food shows that heritage! - Accepts credit cards What we ordered: - Shrimp & grits price was $15 - this was the best shrimp & grits my friend ever had and she's from the South! What makes it so good? It is thick, rich, creamy and decadently cheesy - everything grits should be! They are also generous with the amount of shrimp in this dish! A MUST-get!- Corn-meal fried oyster po-boy $14 - the fried oysters were plumb and juicy, the french roll was nicely toasted and the chipotle remoulade was the perfect ingredient to bring everything together! - Plain beignets $6 for 3 - the outside had a nice crisp, the inside was fluffy and came piping hot from the kitchen! But it was a bit too doughy for me. - Pickled watermelon - this came as a side for the Po-boy but was so delicious, we asked for a little more. What a genius way to repurpose watermelon rind! It was spicy, sweet and had a lovely snap!

This place was like an explosion in my mouth. I wasn't expecting, but loved that the beignets were served first! Having dessert before your meal rocks. I was disappointed in the "grandmas coffee" the namesounded delicious but turns out the molasses was not for me. I had a sip of my friends watermelon iced tea, and it wasn't bad, but I was also disappointed. THE MAIN COURSE WAS BOMB!!!!!! I ordered the shrimp and grits and was so pleased! Also, the beignet flight was unnecessary, just order the plain and the crawfish! The beignets here were better than the beignets in New Orleans and comparable to the beignets in downtown Disney (both bomb!!!). Also, I had a bite of my friends French fries and biscuit and my tastebuds are watering now.....

I instantly fell in love with this place. I was so excited to try it I walked a mile for lunch to go. Everyone was eating breakfast foods when we walked in. Since it was 1pm, I can only assume it is because their breakfast is just that good. I couldn't decide so I ordered a few different things: Gumbo -The texture and ingredients were spot on. I loved the sausage and chicken combination and just the right amount of rice in the bowl. I just wish it was a little spicier and had more okra. But that's because I'm from the Midwest and that is how we do it. They did have very good hot sauce to add though. Grillades & Grits - The beef tenderloin really was very tender. The spicy creole gravy was a consistency somewhere between gravy and spaghetti sauce. Which is a compliment to the beef. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and biscuit was to die for. Also be sure to try the strawberry preserves sitting on the table.My friend got the fried chicken which had great flavor and came with fries and a biscuit. I can't wait come back next time I'm in San Fran. And this time save some room for the beignets!

Best brunch place on Yelp? Of course, I had to come try it. Surprisingly, the wait wasn't as long as I thought it would be which was a great thing. I had to order the chicken because that was what they were known for. And I must say, it tasted like KFC with a kick. It was good but it wasn't anything special like the hype on Yelp has written. The biscuit was good and so were the fries. I was really satisfied with the gumbo. That was the first time I had tried it and it was really good. It was a lot more flavorful than the chicken. The crab cake thing that they were also known for was good too according to my boyfriend. I was a little disappointed with my meal because it was oily. The price was alright, the waitress wasn't very attentive and definitely felt like we were ignored. But that's okay, it was busy and she had too much on her hands I guess.

Whether you come for brunch or for dinner, I highly recommend the 1) fried chicken, and 2) crawfish beignets. They're $4 a piece, but well worth the price. If you look around the restaurant, I'm sure you'll find that every table has at least a few on their table during their meal. Packed full of crawfish, scallions, and cheddar, there's honestly few baked goods that are tastier in my opinion. Definitely try to go at odd hours though to avoid the wait, because the wait can be pretty horrendous... The first time I went for brunch, I had to wait 1.5 hours. For dinner, if you grab a late dinner around 9pm, you're wait may be as short as 15 minutes. 10/10 would recommend, even if this is a tourist heavy destination.

Interior: great 4/5Personell: tired 3/5Serving time: pretty fast 4/5Food: -2/54+3+4-2=9/4=2Ps:I asked server if the food I put my eye on is spicy,I was told that not so much-in reality the meal was so spicy I couldn't feel or taste a thing. Well, I felt pain in my mouth for sure. Considering such a good rating on this place I thought it would meet my expectations.

Brenda's is a staple because the food is really that good!!! I have yet to order something I didn't like. I don't eat pork yet one of my favorite meals there, the shrimp and grits, comes with pork sausage or bacon (whatever - can't remember - some form of pork). Thankfully special ordering isn't frowned upon, so I can always order away!! The crawfish beignets are fiyah!!!! There's almost always a line, but once seated it's so worth the wait!!! Nom nom.

Not bad. Not anything I'd get in NO but not a bad twist on southern comfort food. I got the crispy pork belly and grits and an order of the plain beignets and the watermelon iced tea to drink. I was a bit underwhelmed by the crispy pork belly, not so much because of how it tasted but because there just wasn't much there compared to the grits and onion relish. The relish was good although it tasted like and reminded me of Mexican salsa. I liked the beignets, although I like a bit more powdered sugar on mine. They were the correct texture and temperature and tasted pretty damn good. The watermelon iced tea was the shizzle. James LOVES his iced tea and the idea of sweetening it with watermelon def works for me. Overall I don't think I would waste much time in line for this place (especially since they in the Tenderloin), but when I went on a Monday afternoon there was no real line to speak of and the food came out pretty quick. I would like to go back and try a couple of other items that sounded good so if I am strolling thru the Tenderloin some afternoon and there is no line I will stop in and give them another try.

Brenda's soul food was one of my favorite breakfast/brunch place to eat at whenever I was in sf! I went there for my birthday brunch and I ordered their seasonal pumpkin pancakes, which were very phenomenal. We had 2 orders of their crawfish beignets and they are to die for! If I were to go back again, I would try their flight of beignets cause they all sound really delicious! Their egg benedicts also look very tasty as well!Parking is a bit tough since you have to find it on the streets. Also, if you are looking to go for breakfast, go a bit earlier cause the wait was kind of long when I went.

We tried a cup of gumbo which was pretty good. The cup was the perfect proportion with huge chunks of chicken in it. I don't think I'd be able to eat a whole bowl of it. The beignet flight was delicious. I ordered the oyster po'boy and it had a lot of fried oysters in it that I could barely close the sandwich. The order gives you a choice of either oyster or catfish. Their french fries were tasty and perfectly cooked.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and waited about 15 minutes to get seated for 4 people. We ordered pullpork egg benedicts and shrimp and grits. My friends think the pullpork was really salty and the potatoes were not fully cooked. My shrimp and grits was ok, the tomatoes made it really really sweet which I don't like. The spicy sauce was not spicy and overall it was just not a good taste. The beignets were the only good thing on the table. The crawl fish one was good, chocolate one was so creamy and rich, the apple one tasted ok not super sweet, and the plain one was sugarly. The service was not impressive. The guy who took our order seemed like he did not want to be there or just don't like us. The way he responded to our questions about the food was in a rush way wanting us to just order so he can go on his way. OverallTaste: 3/5Service: 3/5Parking: 3/5 on the street like most SF parkingPrice: 4/5 typical brunch price

Warning: Portions are HUGE. Share. No matter how hungry you think you are, you won't make a dent in your plate and will feel like a horrible, wasteful person. Ok - brunch. Yes! There's nothing like nursing a hangover with shrimp and grits, buttery biscuits, spicy gumbo, sweet beignets. Yaaaaaassss. Bring it. Service is top notch - they have a great system goin' on - coffee kept getting refilled, plates bussed... we even were seated pretty promptly (and of course, we had reservations).

Meh. Waited 30min for a table. Didn't like anything we ordered. Was anticipating dessert the whole but that was a No-Go because of a service miss/mistake. I ordered dessert for after dinner when we sat down. Was told I didn't have to do that. I told him that I wanted to order it now anyway to-go for when we left. Guess what? He didn't. They ran out. He says it's 'bad news.' He didn't think that would happen. He's surprised! Can he get me something else? Left really annoyed.

I've never had an authentic beignet before but this seemed like the place to try it! I expected more of a fluffier texture but it was very dense. Super filling but overall just ok to me. We got the flight plus the anniversary special. My favorite would be the chocolate one. I also got the try the shrimp and grits. This was also my first time having grits and it was delicious!! Pretty greasy and cheesy but that's what made it bomb.

Obviously there is not much more that can be said about this amazing breakfast joint in San Fran but I'm going to continue anyway. First you have to walk in and put your own name their big chalkboard. Why?? Because they are SO stinking busy that they got smart and said "Do it your damn self." Think smarter, not harder, I like that! I believe we waited for a little over an hour. Is a small restaurant that everyone wants to go to and I thought that was pretty good considering it was 12 o'clock on a Saturday. After scoping their Yelp Page I knew I wanted their Crawfish Beignets . They did not disappoint. Covered in Creole seasoning and puffed up to 4 times the size of my fist, was stuffed with warm crawfish covered in cheese and super flavorful sauce. Than I decided to have something I have never tried before. Shrimp and Grits... I figured, what a better place to try it for the first time. Holy cow... So good. The only problem is that grits are so filling. But I will say it was creamy, the sauce on top was decadent, the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I'm not sure I can try shrimp and grits anywhere else ever again. I just have a feeling it wont measure up. I just love the concept of this place. I think its very different. French Comfort food? Who would have guessed!? So happy I decided to wait in that line and give this place a try.

I was looking for somewhere to grab a bite by myself while on a business trip here in SF and had to check this place out after reading all of the reviews. I was seated quickly (although I guess that's pretty common with a party of 1) and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive.But lets get the important stuff...the crawfish beignets. If you don't order them while you're here you're doing it wrong. They were the most perfectly cheesy salty gooey ball of deliciousness in the center with a finely crusted outer shell dusted in just the right amount of cayenne. I took one of the three that come with the dish home and almost couldn't eat it, I was so depressed for the experience to be over. Paired with a cold beer on a hot day *shudder*...excuse me while I run back to Brenda's.

When the hotel room was not ready, I searched for the best breakfast spots in SF to get breakfast food. Brenda's had great reviews so I decided to check it out. The wait was very long with it being a Saturday afternoon. I had time to kill anyway so I popped into the coffee shop next door. Luckily I was able to sit there for a good hour having my coffee because they come in there to check for people waiting on tables. Once I was finally seated inside the food came very quickly. This was great because I was starving by then. I ordered the fried chicken benedict, the cheese grits, and a side of the potatoes. The food was good but I don't think that it was worth the wait. I would eat here again but only on a slow day. Overall, it's a solid restaurant though.
