I happened to be walking past The Codmother just as she was opening the gate for the day. There were already people waiting, which I took to be a very good sign. It's a food truck that seems to be semi-permanently parked with a gated dining area. Later, on my way back to the car, I decided to check it out. The menu is simple and easy to follow, and I just had to try the fish and chips.The fish was piping hot and the batter was golden and crispy. The cod filets were perfectly cooked. The chips (fries) were also good, and each table had both ketchup and malt vinegar depending on how you like yours.Also, when I ordered my food, I looked around to see all the tables were currently occupied. I asked the lady at the window if she could change my order to go. I think she could tell my concern, and said she would be happy to, but was I sure I didn't want to stay? She explained that she was almost positive a table would open up, and if not she would box it up for me. Turns out she was totally right. Just before my food was ready, 3 tables had become available. It's tight quarters, but they are totally on top of things. They kept their tables clean and wiped down between guests, and seemed to really take pride in their business.

Been wanting to try this place based on such high ratings... but I was a bit let down.Friendly service, nice patio seating and reasonable price for what you get.I got the combo: 2 fish, 4 shrimp and fries. Shrimp was big and nice and crispy and good with the cocktail sauce. Chips/fries were big cuts and tasted nice. Fish had nice quality cod but there was so much batter that in the end I was left with a basket of leftover batter. The batter fell off instantly as I took a bite. The tartar sauce was just ok.I'm glad I tried this place but didn't think it was anything that special. It was slightly above average, but gave them 4 stars because they were so friendly.

I love Fish & Chips and had a high expectation-- considering a number of reviews on this place so far this place is "ehh". I went here with my parents and was excited to try and see what they have so we ordered one of each on the menu and I was not impressed. The fishes are big and is also moderately priced but I don't think it was well worth the wait (if it was busy). I've been Andreas in Ventura, Splash in SLO/ Pismo, Blue Grill in SD, Giovanni and Galleys in Morro bay (to name a few), this was by far not anywhere near close to it. Trying to find this location was hard.. we walked around the area in search of this place next to the other truck and thought maybe it was in a wrong location but you have to GO AROUND the corner to find this thing lol. There are only a few seatings, luckily we went when it wasn't busy so finding a seat was easy but during peak hours.. good luck!Parking was convenient because its right across the parking lot HOWEVER.. parking is ridiculously expensive! $7 bucks an hour or $42 a day to park in the parking lot (if you can't find street parking). That is insane, parking in LA is typically $12 at most for the entire day. If you go over 1 minute of parking, you get charged additionally for that hour.. No Bueno! I don't think I'll ever come here again, the food isn't worth the wait and the lady that gave us our food had a British accent seems to be nice at first but talks behind your back once you leave the premise.. She's done that twice while we were eating our food.

Yes!This place is awesome. Walking distance from the hotel, another great Yelp find. There is outdoor seating only. Employees are super friendly and helpful. It takes some time for your food to get ready, but it's all very fresh. The batter was light and flavorful. The was fresh and soft. Chips paired perfectly with the fish. Their menu is straightforward. They offer fish and chips, shrimp, fish/shrimp tacos, chips w/ different toppings, and fried Oreos. Definitely recommend a visit to The Godmother Fish and Chips when you're in the area. Free drink with Yelp check-in. Thanks friends :D

Been having this place bookmarked for the longest and finally got around to trying it over the weekend. This place is a permanent food truck located on the outskirts of fisherman's wharf. Seating is Limited to about 25 and the rest is standing, we had to wait for someone to leave before we could get a table. We ordered the fish and chips the fish $10.99, it just ok it was more Crispy batter then fish and the Tartar sauce is basically mayonnaise with a few sweet chopped up pickles in it. There is way better Fish and chips on Pier 39. I'm just glad I finally got this bookmark out of the way. I get this place a 3 and half star.

Great ocean side snack. Be prepared to rub elbows and share tables. Our order was fresh out of the fryer, use the fork they give you or eat fish over the basket because oil will come out. Thicker style breading. Chips seemed hand cut.

In the running for the best fish and chips iv ever eaten except for maybe nosh in seattle and located at the tourist trap we all periodically take our visiting friends to fishermans warf. Cheap, fresh, and delicious. I ordered the combo meal which came with several shrimp, fries, and 2 large battered filets of whole meaty cod. Needless to say it was amazing and left me in a greasy coma.

Loooooooove Codmother! I've been coming here for years, mostly when I have a friend/relative coming to visit. The fish is just so perfectly cooked with nice crispy batter around it. Seating is pretty limited, so try to go at an off time. I also recommend the fries with baja sauce (I think it's called that?). The staff is always upbeat and ready to take your order asap. One time when my brother and I were there, we argued about what type of fish they use, even though it clearly says in the restaurant's name. Turns out we were both wrong, smh.

Do not understand why this place got a such high review..... fried fish, shrimp and fries are all they have...... the fish is ok, but only a small bit under the thick fried dough. The shrimp taco is a big disappointment. 3 Fried shrimps sit on the taco.. that's it... no flavor from the sauce....

Oh my COD, fish and chips doesn't get any more real than this! The Codmother is a permanently parked food truck in Fisherman's Wharf that serves up delicious, crispy, and downright drool-worthy fish and chips.The truck is tucked away and not obviously visible from the street if you're not looking for it. Just follow your nose and the line of people lingering around a fence.I've only ever had their fish and chips here (although they have a variety of other temptations to satisfy any palate). Each fish and chips order comes with two hunks of perfectly deep-fried cod fish -- super crunchy on the outside and moist and piping hot on the inside -- sitting atop a bed of chips. It's also, of course, served with a side of tartar sauce.An order of fish and chips will cost you $10, which is totally reasonable considering the area and the deliciousness that you're getting in each basket.During peak meal hours, be prepared to hover and swipe for tables. There isn't a whole lot of seating available.

Oh my Cod! This truck is your best bet for cheap and good eats when at the Fisherman's Wharf. It's parked at the open parking lot a block away from all the touristy stuff facing away from the water. With only a few umbrella-covered tables, you get the gist, the place is fairly small. Not to worry though, the turnaround is pretty quick since their menu is simple with only fried fish and shrimps served by itself or on tacos, plus a variety of "Chips Gone Wild" to choose from. Their FISH and CHIPS ($10.99) was the real deal. Made by the mother of cod who hails from the UK, and I only know this as I heard her speak the Queen's English, what else is there to expect but... golden and crisp breading, fresh and flaky cod fish, as well as chips that are thick-cut and crunchy. I wanted something with a twist so I got their CRAZY FRIES (extra $) which was slathered in Baja sauce loaded with garlic. Go the regular chips route if you don't want to be overwhelmed with all that flavor. Meanwhile, going back to the fish, the only way to devour this would be with malt vinegar and tartar sauce. Trust me on this. It's bloody good.

Passed by The Codmother on my way back from exploring the area past Fisherman's Wharf. Since I love fish and chips, I thought I'd try it out and report back to my other fish and chip loving friends.Located on Beach Street in what appears to be a permanent food truck surrounded by tables for patrons to sit, The Codmother draws in many locals and tourists alike. The line seems to always be about 5 people deep but it moves quickly. I ordered the fish and chips (2 pieces of fish and fries). When it came out, it was nicely fried and fresh out of the fryer. The pieces were longer than the plastic fork they gave me. I really enjoyed the first piece. By the second piece, I was little overwhelmed by all the breading and the oil intake. They don't list drink prices on their menu and probably for good reason. A can of soda was $2! I should've gone to the store and paid less for one. Oh well, it was a hot day and it paired well with my fish and chips. Seating appears limited but small parties will often share table and people are in and out since many are there to explore. It was also really windy out so maybe they wanted to take cover somewhere. If I were to come back again, I would opt for a junior size fish and chips.

The service was friendly and food was outstanding! The fish & prawns were fried perfectly. I really enjoyed the loaded fries too. Everything was crispy, fresh and not greasy. Try the Baja sauce-I loved it!Seating can be a little hard to find and area isn't the cleanest but I would defiantly check this place out if you are in the area.

Hands down the best fish and chips in the city. I don't think I've had more perfectly battered fish than at Codmother. Some places drench the fish with too much batter, but that's definitely not an issue here. The fish itself is cooked perfectly, as it flakes apart the moment you bite into it. For a food truck, the price is super reasonable, and service is above average. If you only have one opportunity to grab fish and chips in the city, go to Codmother.

Best fish and chips...Hands down. This food truck is actually run by actual English people. They are such lovely and fantastic people. Just order a Fish and Chips. The fish was super giant. It was made fresh and came out really hot. Super crispy on the outside and tender flaky fish on the inside. I almost didn't need the tartare sauce to go with it. The chips aka fries came out fresh as well. Good crispy chips. Amazing. No fish and chips will beat the codmother.

Literally the worst fish and chips I've ever had in my life. Simply put, the batter was just not crispy. If fish and chips aren't crispy...what's the point? The batter is super thick and almost chewy. I literally pulled it off the fish to make it more edible. At least the fish fillets were large. We also ordered the garlic fries...just thick cut fries with a sprinkle of garlic... tourist trap all the way -_-

The truck is hard to find. Google maps will not lead you there. Just look at all the trucks at the corner and you'll eventually find it. I'm normally not the biggest fan of deep fried sweets. But this place did deep fried Oreos right. They're were the perfect constituency, chewy while still having crumbs sprinkled throughout to chomp on. And surprisingly not too sweet. There's not a lot of seating here, so plan on taking it to go. Grab a bench over by the water.

I'm surprised by the ratings and the number of reviews of this place. I would definitely say that this is a tourist spot and I would not come here again. This place is located near Fisherman's Wharf and attracts many people for its great location. However, the taste of the food is mediocre.We ordered the Fish and Chips as everyone else does. The batter on the fish had a great texture and the fish was moist but there was no flavor. It needed some salt or some sort of spice to actually make it taste like something. The fries were so starchy and potato-y that I didn't even want to finish them. For $11, you get 2 pieces of fish and French fries. Definitely not worth it.Overall, avoid this spot if you can. I didn't enjoy any of the food I had. It's cheaper than the places around it, but you're better off spending more for a yummier meal!

First time to this place, and also second time ever trying fish and chips. So I took my family to this place seeing the reviews for how good the fish and chips are here. We went on a Tuesday around 4 pm. There was almost no one at the place. I'm not much of a fish and chips lover, but since we came all the way to Fishermans Wharf, we decided to try some. Only me, my mom and dad wanted to eat, so we just got one Combo of Shrimp, Fish, and the Chips. The lady taking our order was very nice and friendly.The food came out and at first I thought the portion wouldn't be enough for us, but it was more than enough. Two big pieces of fish, four shrimp, and some chips for $13.99. This has been the best fish and chips I've had so far. The batter was crisp and the fish tasted fresh. There is no seasoning at all, so you can eat it with tar tar sauce, the cocktail sauce, or just hot sauce. As for the shrimp, not as good. The shrimp was a bit on the chewy side, so a bit hard for me to bite into it, but my parents loved it. The french fries(chips) tasted fresh and were piping hot. My dad loved them.Overall I think this place has really good fish and chips, but won't be back. I noticed no matter how good fish and chips are, we couldn't eat a lot of it. It has that greasy taste to it, so the more you eat, you get sick of it real quick. I do recommend though that to try this place out.

Fish and chip without the chips. Read great reviews here so it's a must try. 4.5 star with over 2,000 review. Base of my tastebuds I thought it was ok. It's s bit salty. Even Ron Kwang thought it was salty but he liked it since he likes salty food. Overall I rate 3 star. The service is great with nice outdoor bench seatings. Still the best fish and chips we had was in Sausalito.

My favorite touristy place to take friends visiting the city who drag me to Fisherman's Wharf. Can be kind of hard to find. It's around the corner from the other food stands/truckesque nonsense. Parking's hard to find, go figure. But you might get lucky. Limited seating, all outdoor. They specialize in cod and they do it pretty darn well. Everyone who works here is absolutely hilarious, British, and extremely friendly. They spend a lot of time with tourists and they know how to charm their customers. The fish is still absolutely delicious, and it's been maybe four years since the last time I've had it. The fried batter and the most tender cod inside it. If you love fish and chips, this place doesn't disappoint. The only thing that disappoints is when your stomach is too full to finish the rest of your fish and chips order. That and the salt overload that's making you craving a bucket of water. Every time I come here I make the mistake of ordering too much. What can I say- my eyes are bigger than my stomach.If you're in Fisherman's Wharf, go ahead and try The Codmother.

Consider this a Batter and chips spot. And I am not saying that because I ran into Hunter Pence but rather because the fish is hardly tasted. That's all there is to justifying the 2.Now some ideas as to why it's rated as high as it is...The trailers cuteness? The prime location?The "how was everything" that the owner swings your way will probably get you to label the meal as coming with good service.The rating with the amount of reviews might get your taste buds to conform into thinking it's great.The owners British accent may fool you into thinking this spot is as authentic as it getsOr maybe...it's just meAnd after all that...The Codmother is still worth visiting, under 15$ is the cost for sharing a reasonable portion with whoever you're in SF with. Not a bad price for you to find out what the hype is all about...or in my case...what it's not about. Side notes: Their shrimp was nothing past what I could find at a cheap street stop near the oceanic shores of Baja. Chips...they're there.

Very pricey for amount of seafood but the fried shrimps are bomb! They use really large shrimps and they are very juicy. The fried fish however, was just ok. The fish is actually a small piece so although it's cooked very well, the batter to meat ratio was off for me. Lastly, the fries (chips) were average. They were mostly good for filling me up since there wasn't a ton of seafood. The British lady who takes the order is really sweet. We went around 4 pm so the line was short and our order only took 8-10 minutes to make. I'd come back for the fried shrimps, so 4 stars.

The dream of a fish and chip is light, airy and fresh. This wasn't light. I did feel I was chewing into a lot of batter. When I've been to London it far surpassed it. But hey when I was eating there tour buses stopped and said how much they loved it from their blow horns and people from the U.K. we're in line (didn't see if they liked it though). So I don't know maybe I missed something. Overall service was great and fries great so I'm gonna say a solid four but don't over expect the world especially if you've been to the U.K.

After seeing the number of Yelp reviews of this place, I knew I had to stop by. It was freezing and windy the day that I visited, but there was still a pretty long line. After a 15-20 minute wait, I was finally able to order. I was greeted by a somewhat harried, but overall very nice woman. Since I had just finished eating a clam chowder, I decided to just get an order of the junior fish and then the loaded fries. As soon as I finished my order, I got my food! I ended up taking it to go since the small seating area of wooden tables and benches was relatively crowded. The junior fish was a bit overpriced, but combined with the tartar sauce, its freshness was more than evident. However, despite being a bit bland for my taste, I enjoyed the light crispiness of the crust.Moving onto the fries, these were definitely worth. I would 100% recommend these. They look incredibly heavy, but are really satisfying without making you feel like you're going to have a heart attack after you eat them. The homemade Baja sauce is again light but flavorful, and the fries could stand to be a little crispier, but the mix of cheese, garlic, and sauce was amazing. Definitely a great snack to share with a friend. If you're nearby, would say it's worth the wait!

It's a permanent food truck parked in a corner. Found on yelp. Thousands of helpers can't be wrong, so we had to try. Both of us got the junior fish and chips, and that is all you need. In fact we could have split the regular one because it's double the junior. I like that they put salt and vinegar on all the picnic benches outside, because that's what you do in London... they use cod, the breading was thin not overkill. The fries were some of the best. Would love to come back and try shrimp. Or tacos.

The fries were just like some excellent fish shops in England. Can't go to London? Go here. I have no doubt this place serves the best fish and chips in San Francisco

A decent place for lunch, especially if you have kids. I mean, who doesn't love fried food??The basic fish and chips order comes with two pieces of fish, chips and tartar sauce. Chips are that typical British style thick cut potato, so they're definitely not gonna be that crispy fry that Americans are used to. Good but meh. Get your antacids ready if you know what I mean.

This place is good and compares to the fish and chips I had in the UK. The fish is fried perfectly and priced just right. If you're around the area I would recommend this spot for some good eats.

Fun experience to eat out next to a food truck. Fish was cooked perfectly. Their fries were ok and the special sauce was ok but neither anything to rave about. Not worth the cost or wait IMHO.

The best deep fried fish and shrimp, inconsistent on the chips. I've had fish and chips in several places in London and in many places in California, but Codmother beats them all. The fish and shrimp: deep fried and well seasoned (I saw a review saying her food wasn't seasoned. I've been here many times and never experienced this). Many deep fried fish I've had were too crispy, but this place always gets it right for me. I prefer the shrimp. Chips: sometimes crispy, sometimes slightly mushy. Enough salt.There's room for improvement. Not a huge deal since the main thing is the seafood. Value: you get plenty of food for $10. Excellent value meal considering the area.

It was ok ...we order fish taco($7)..the tortilla was not that warm it was breaking and laking flavor in fish.. the texture was crunchy which was good. The fish and chips($11) was a little better because we dipped them in the amazing tartar sauce, and the fries were really good.

The food was quite good and exactly what you would want from a Fish & Chip shop - the batter on the fish was just right in thickness and had a nice crunch. The chips were thick and crisp on the outside but fluffy on the inside. The only minor complaint was that when I went on a Saturday afternoon at around 2:30 there was still about a 30 minute wait. Fish & Chips were $10.99 before tax.

While in SF for work I took an Uber here after my bud invited me to lunch. Really, he's my boss...so I had to go with him. We took two separate Ubers because a small lunch group quickly turned into 8 people haha. He left before me and arrived. I asked him if he was sure this was worth it - and that my Uber was lost, should I just cancel? He replied back with a photo and the following caption:"SORRY FOR TAKING YOU TO ONE OF THE TOP 100 RESTAURANTS IN THE UNITED STATES". Attached was a photo of a print out the owners made of the Top 100 Places To Eat list that Yelp puts out each year. There they were....on the list. And displaying it proudly for all to see. I hopped in my Uber, more excited than I ever thought I'd be for fish and chips.We piled out of the car and were greeted by a food cart, with a window to order. About 20 people there (8 of them co-workers). I ordered the large fish and chips - although I almost ordered the fish tacos. No, we had an objective...get what's the most popular. So I did. And I don't regret it one bit. The fish and chips is a massive serving of battered and fried cod, and thick cut french fries. Healthy? I'll go with a hard no. Delicious? HELL YEAH!They have some benches set up and all the seating is outside. The lovely SF weather made for a fine alfresco lunch. It's affordable, large servings and the food gets cranked out pretty fast. Glad I got to make it out - and eat at one of the TOP 100 PLACES TO EAT IN THE UNITED STATES.

My first trip to the ever so popular Codmother. With those British accents being thrown around, I would imagine it doesn't get any more authentic than this, straight from the motherland! With this being said, I am torn. I was not a fan of the chips, a little too thick for my liking. Also was a little disappointed with the shrimp. Although perfectly breaded, it lacked seasoning. Now the fish is another thing altogether. The fish was good. Like really good. Who are we kidding, the best fish I've ever had. Crispy and fresh! Not too salty. On another note, what an awesome staff manning the orders. Keep up the smiles!

I think it's okay... The batter on my shrimp was falling off. The taste was nothing special. The cod fisher fried was pretty good with the sauce, but still nothing special. I got the combo just to try a little bite of everything.

I had been looking forward to eating here for months! But sadly I was a bit disappointed. I got 2 pieces of fish only, along with a side of their special sauce. There was just too much breading on the fish! It was cooked fine on the outside, but the inside was kinda doughy. And the fish itself was just okay, not very tender unfortunately. If they cut back on the breading I think it could be good, but it's just way too much. The special sauce was quite good though!

Really genuinely delicious fish n chips sort of squirreled away on Fisherman's Wharf. The breading is perfect! The owners are friendly and speak the Queen's English. They have simple offerings and a food truck layout with plenty of seating. Simple and tasty.

Consistently ranked as one of the best restaurants in the US. Can't possibly live up to the hype? WRONG! This place is legit. I have read about this place before. So when I found out a caravan of Ubered co-workers were heading there, I called dibs on my seat.The only downfall of our visit was that they were supposed to be opening within a few minutes of us getting there. But we had to wait an extra 15-20 before we could order. But as a patient person when it comes to great food, you won't see me complaining about anything else this review. Everyone in the group got their own order of fish. And we decided to go in on a few different types of the chips. We got the ones with baja and cheese and the real stink with garlic and parmesan. Both were extremely good, but those real stink were definitely my favorite. As for the fish... I don't know what it is. But it was fried fish to perfection. Great flavor, freshness, and the batter was perfect. Their homemade tarter sauce was a great compliment.The group finished off the meal with a couple of orders of the fried oreos. I am not a big dessert person, but these were impressive. The savory of the batter with the sweetness of the oreo was a great blend. There are so many great places in San Francisco to eat. But I hope this is one of the spots I will get to repeat!

Good, but not the best (I'm sorry, but the best fish & chips I've ever had was in England!). Beware....the portions are monstrous! I ordered their fish and chips dish and I was told it was two strips of fish with fries. It didn't sound like that much food, so I went for it (with a side of baja sauce of course). When the food came out, I was stunned. No wonder it was $13 after tax. The fish was HUGE. You could honestly share the dish with another person, especially since the breading is very heavy and fills you up fast. The batter was delicious and the fish was good as well. I just wish the batter wasn't so heavy, it didn't sit well with me afterwards.

This is my family's favorite place to get fish and chips in San Francisco. We call it the In N Out of fish and chips. The fresh cod is covered in this great batter that is light and crispy. Perfect fries complement the fish. I like my fries with some stink (garlic and Parmesan cheese).

Sleeping with the fishes?Well, not quite; but I'd rather eat the fishes. I finally found my way to Fisherman's Wharf where most locals try to stay away from unless you have visitors requesting to come here. On a typical chilly, foggy, misty and cold San Francisco evening, we ventured here among the flock of tourists on a summer night like Don Vito Corleone stalking his enemies on the streets of New York. Only difference is I wasn't going for the kill since what I wanted was already sacrificed to benefit the top of the food chain. Upon arrival, there were a few people in line which gave us time to check the menu. And of course we wanted to Fish & Chips, but we got tripped up with the fries and decided to ask the experts behind the counter. There were two ladies working there and they couldn't be any friendlier. They were sweet, nice, enthusiastic and very helpful. Aside from the obvious, we also ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and went with the recommended Crazy Fries and Fully Loaded Fries which consisted of baja, cheese and garlic. Let's just say they gave us an offer we couldn't refuse. We grabbed a table on a corner and underneath a heat lamp to shield us from the elements. As soon as they called our order, we started digging in to keep us warm and so that the food doesn't get cold and soggy on a typical summer night. It's true that revenge is a dish best serve cold, and you don't want to eat cold fries. The fish they serve here are huge, plus they have a flaky crust as the batter is light and the fish was soft and delicious. A little dab of vinegar on each bite and we could've been in London enjoying Big Ben.The fish tacos were the same consistency as they were hot and delicious. And the fries were just absurd. We ordered two kinds and quickly realized we ordered too much. Both were good, garlicky, cheesy and crackin' that it became evident that eating too much of them would make us full in a jiffy. We enjoyed every bit about though and donated the rest of our leftover fries to the homeless. That would be a classic Don VIto move right there.

After a major disappointment eating at The Slanted Door, we were redeemed by spending (literally) a quarter of the price for dinner at the Codmother! Just so anyone doesn't know, this is a food truck with outside seating. We came on a beautiful day, so it was no issue. We got the fish and chips and combo (fish/shrimp) with Baja cheese fries. The fish was delicious and well battered, shrimp was in a lighter batter and fantastic and the Baja fries had a nice sauce on it (not too heavy with mayo and good flavors). Overall this place "saved" our thoughts on the SF food scene (we had a crappy crab chowder from the wharf too). But here? So good.

It was a pretty awful basket of fish and chips. The fish was decent but the batter was greasy and lacked the crunchiness that makes greasy into good. The fries had a doughy texture and also lacked crunch. The atmosphere is what you would expect from a food truck. The picnic tables were clean and shaded. The service from the truck was fine. The two fish and chip orders plus two limonata cans came to $29. For a tourist area, that's probably typical but for bad food, that's irritating. Four hours later, I still feel like I was tortured and forced to drink blocks of flavorless grease.

They are 83rd of top 100 places to eat in the US.Looking for place to eat for lunch after getting off a boat at the Pier 33, most in the area didn't have good reviews except this place. It was a bit of walk but I was glad Yelp led me to this place. I wouldn't have found this food truck if not for Yelp.It was around 1pm but a long line of people. Managed to get one table while waiting in line. After ordering food, it was about 10 mins wait.Staff was very friendly, but they don't come out to clean the tables. Fish and chips I ordered was very good. Batter was just so perfect. I've had fish and chips before and learned just right amount of batter makes difference in how the fish is cooked. They offer one of the best fish and chips I had in the past. Food truck with some picnic tables outside only. Expect some wait but it was worth it for me.

On a trip to SF, my friends and I found this place near fisherman`s Wharf (walking distance) and decided to try it out. Generally, I`m not a big fish and chips person, but I left satisfied with my meal.Environment: It is a food truck, but it also does have a seating area outside of the food truck. When I went on a weekday it wasn`t too crowded and the order came fairly fast. We didn`t get too much interactions so I`m not too sure about customer service, but it was pretty standard. I would assume it could get crowded but there are only about 8 tables, although the tables could seat pretty big parties.Food: I ordered the combo which was Fish, Shrimps and Chips. I wasn`t much of a fan of the chips, they were mediocre, and I like my chips to be more crispy, but these were a little limpy and soft. It could be a matter of preference. The fried shrimp was really good, and it was my favorite of the three. I liked the fish, however, the batter was thicker than I thought and a little overwhelming. It just tasted like oil, but none the less, it was comfort food and I loved it with their tartar sauce.

Totally British, yeah! Fish chips, tartar sauce, shrimp taco and Baja fish taco..all fresh earned once star. The lady at the door with a British accent earned the one star. The quality of food was very bad, is pedestrian fish and heavily breaded with the chips being dry

The descriptions and reviews can be a little misleading. This is a food truck parked in a little fenced area, if you are looking for ambiance, keep looking. But the food is pretty good, hand breaded fish, deep fried.
