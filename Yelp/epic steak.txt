We had heard of the mysterious "Fog Martini", and figured since we were in town, why not spend a pretty penny on a region specific beverage! I mean... this vodka is distilled with fog from the bay! We couldn't pass it up. We're not big on martinis, but I tell you what, it did NOT disappoint. The martini is served straight up. Served in a separate glass on ice, you have the option of adding 3 blue cheese stuffed green olives (so delicious) and a lemon peel. We tried the martini solo and I eventually added the olives, then the lemon peel. The olives definitely stepped it up a notch. I enjoyed every last drop much more than I had ever anticipated. Totally worth every penny. PS. Their French fries were AMAZING! Awesome industrial decor throughout. Great service, and good eats!

Summary: Fantastic waterfront view (Bay Bridge), excellent steaks, impeccable service, good wine selection, ok happy hour, pricey.Details: There's no debate that EPIC is a really good steakhouse but I can't say it's epic (not quite). But it's top 3 in SF and that's worth plenty.Since you're going to eat a lot of meat, you might as well eat some greens. You can "craft your own salad". I ask for all the ingredients except the fruit (that's 12 items). There's usually too much salad dressing for my taste so remember to ask them to use less. Alternately, get the "Festival Style" spanish octopus - yum. A friend of mine swears by the Wagyu beef carpaccio but beef before beef is too much even for me.The 9oz filet ($49) is perfectly cooked and slightly seasoned. This is your go-to dish. On my last visit the ribeye ($61) was a little under-cooked. A shade short of medium was more like a shade more than medium rare. If money is no object, try order the porterhouse ($94) and tell me how it is. I can't justify a hundy for a steak. The sides are frankly disappointing. Julia Child would not be happy with the potatoes that bear her name. The carrots are boring. I guess you could get the fries. There's an interesting collection of desserts (including a build your own sundae) but I've never had any room left to try any of them. You can eat outside on the patio with some incredible views. They have heaters and blankets if it's a cold night. There's a bar upstairs with outside seating but it's almost always crowded.Epic is worth a visit. I just wish they had better sides.

You probably won't find another restaurant in San Francisco with a more breathtaking view of the Bay Bridge than EPIC. You will, however, probably find better steaks elsewhere. I was really excited with this being my first time trying dry-aged steak, but the steaks were very normal-tasting with the exception of the tenderloin portion of the porterhouse, which was indeed very tender. Presentation of the food is lackluster, and with the bill topping $250 for three people, I expected a little more wow factor to the meal.

Overpriced and underwhelming. Nice location and view but there are many other better options along the Embarcadero.I had steak and added crab nothing special about either and the crab seemed soggy and the steak flavorless. Poorly plated also. The service was good but I came for food which overall disappointed.

I came back for more last Saturday and this time, I switched up my dinner. This time I had their 9 oz. Filet Mignon which was cooked medium rare and cooked with Point Reyes Blue Cheese. This was phenomenal. The cheese melted throughout the steak and had a nice bite to it. For dessert, I had their sundae option which I got to build on my own. I had the vanilla, chocolate, horchata with macaron bits and fudge. For $12 this was solid. It was fulfilling and delicious. Not that bad of a price either!

Amazing views, build your own dessert, and steaks with wine.Pros:+ The view!!+ Outside seating right along the Embarcadero+ Blankets offered for outdoor seating+ Top notch service+ Build your own dessert option!!+ Extensive wine selections +moreCons:- Appetizers are overpricedRecommendations:+ 14oz Dry Aged Ribeye (share this!)+ BYO dessert: chocolate + vanilla ice cream (homemade so they say), chocolate lace, macaron bits, brownie bitesSkip:- Wagyu carpaccio (read on)Our 14oz came sliced in half already since they knew we were sharing. Appreciated that. I'd say skip the wagyu because for three slices at close $18ish, it's not worth. Good, yea. To die for? Nah. Pass. Loved the dessert options!!With drinks and dessert, for two people: $150Will be back!

This place is pretty nice, sitting near the water and in view of one of the bridges.We came here for drinks, which we had in their second-floor bar. The second floor has a small balcony, which overlooks the walkway and the water. The inside is nice and comfortable.The bartender was super nice. She struck a conversation with us, where we gave here tips on the best places to go in SoCal. Likewise, she gave us good pointers on where to go and what to see in NorCal. After having our drinks, we carried on in our adventure. This was a good stop along the way, I'll give this place five stars.

Hands down, the best spot in San Fransisco. As a first timer to this city, I looked at a lot of reviews on some places to go with good food and views. EPIC was on the top of everyone's list. So, we decided to try EPIC out. The moment we got there, the staff was exceptionally friendly, and willing to do anything to accommodate our needs. We wanted to sit outside to have the Bay Bridge as our view, but worried it was too cold. The staff assured us we will be warm, as the had table heaters and blankets. As our waiter approached us, he was professional and friendly. Throughout the stay, he catered to our needs and made sure we were happy. The manager even came by to say hi and thanked us for being a guest. The food, a bit pricey, was worth every penny. Prime rib was cooked exactly how I ordered. The view- is unreal and can not be put into words. Between the food and the view, EPIC made going to San Fransisco the best part of our visit. I will recommend this spot to anyone and go back 100x over. Thank you to the staff, for making our visit THE BEST experience I've ever had- anywhere. A shout out to Jesse, our waiter, for making my birthday special and being so wonderful!

This probably isn't the most accurate review of the restaurant but based on my experience I'd definitely go on my own again! The views at this venue are stunning and it's pretty large, with an outdoor area, an upstairs, and couple of different private dining spaces.I came for a business lunch and the menu was pre-set but I'll talk about the food that I did have which is on their main menu as well :) For starters, they served hors d'oeurves of Seared Ahi Tuna bites, Vegetarian Empanadas (I believe there was potato inside?), and a Crispy Tortilla Chip with Carnitas. All were well seasoned and yes, I had multiple of each.For starters, I had the Epic Caesar, which had these nice romaine lettuce leaves, not too much dressing, croutons, and parmesan. It was simple and standard, with bread served on the side. I think it would've been nice to add a little more "Epic".My main was the 6oz Filet on top of mashed potatoes, served with mushrooms (porcini?) and a reduction sauce of some sort. I asked for rare but got more of a medium--no worries though, the beef was SO GOOD and the mushrooms/potatoes/sauce balanced everything really well! On the main menu, this dish is about $34 so a little high but it was a very good steak.For dessert, my colleague took the lava cake and I had the lemon tart--the tart was SUPER sweet, I couldn't eat it--a good concept but not the best execution. The lava cake was on point with creamy ice cream.If I came again, I'd probably stop by for brunch or lunch with a view and maybe not order steak--they have some other great options that seem promising so maybe a team lunch in the near future.... ;)

One of the best steaks in the City! We came here to celebrate Mother's Day. To my disappointment they were not offering ribeye on the special Mother's Day brunch menu but the waiter was able to work his magic with the chef and was able to serve a bone-in ribeye. It is 28oz but looks like a 42oz with the bone. The price was high for a 28oz steak at $106 but well worth it. Perfectly prepared and paired well with a Silver Oak cab. On a gorgeous day like it was for Mother's Day the outside dining area had amazing views of the Bay. What a great experience. Highly recommended from a self-proclaimed food, steak and wine snob :)

What a disappointing evening. I was looking forward to a nice dinner with my wife and friends.only think is good about this restaurant is the view. What a terrible dinner and service! What a joke this place is. I mean the meat is from restaurant depot some of the lowest quality conventional food product that you can get and for a meat/steak restaurant that supposed to be from a country that raises some of the highest quality meat. Epic is typical, is its knock off of a style of claiming to be authentic but uses the lowest quality food products. My wife's T-bone was over cooked. Waitress was rude and offensive. And managers didn't seem to care. Don't waste your time with this joke of restaurant. Much better choices nearby

Came here for dinner with a party of 8. We were celebrating and occasion and they accommodated us with a pretty good table by the window so we had a nice view of the bridge. My first complaint is that service was lacking. For a "fancy" spot that is definitely not cheap, you would guess service would be better. Once we got seated, no waiters or waitresses came to take our order. After 15min, we flagged someone down but they said they would call our waiter.. which took another 5min.Second - the steaks were super bland. Yes, they give you salt and sauces to sprinkle but I prefer it if they seasoned the steak and cooked it as well. The pros werre that the steak was cooked well but not the tenderest ribeye out there. Sides were meh. Sauces were eh.

While pricey for the portion size, the service is great. The staff is genuinely courteous. I brought in my almost 12 week old son, who behaved very well, and they didn't bat an eye.

After arriving in San Fran for just a couple of hours, our friends who lived there tried taking us to the market to some seafood joint for a late lunch that didn't take reservations. It was a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and after finding out that it would be a 1.5 hour wait, we walked over to Epic instead. We found a table with nice leather chairs by the window on the 2nd floor so we had a bit of a view and a nice breeze. Two of us ordered the bacon cheddar wagyu burger which came with fries ($17), one ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail ($24) and I ordered the korean style short ribs ($12). The burgers were good but definitely on the small side (mind you, I live in Buffalo). My friend's shrimp cocktail was more of an appetizer despite its price, and my korean style short ribs were a joke - they were not really short ribs, I felt like I pretty much chewed on bones and cartilage. None of us wanted to order any more food even though we were all still hungry because the prices just seemed so ridiculous (which we quickly learned that that is the norm in San Fran). We ended up spending more money on drinks than food, since each drink was $12-15 and we had 2 rounds of drinks.Nonetheless - we had a good time catching up with friends.

Really disappointed about how poorly I was treated by Kevin the bartender at this place. I feel like epic is a gem on embarcadero, but the Kevins snarky ass attitude turned me completely off. Don't want to play the race card, but he was a lot nicer and accommodating to the white people at the bar than he was to me. They even made a comment after he left, how uncomfortable they felt after witnessing our exchange. Luckily the manager was polite and able to help me, but it's not enough to make me come back to this place.

Four of us had dinner midweek around 6pm. I made a reservation on OpenTable. Our Uber driver had no problem finding it. One is immediately struck by the open decor. Loved it! And I had a great view of the bridge. After taking our drink order, they brought around a warm brown bread and served each person two slices. They also brought a thick slab of butter with large salt crystals in top. Seriously, who resist that??? The table already had a trio of gourmet salts in small dishes- a white, a pink, and a black. I started my dinner with the create your own salad (you choose ingredients from an extended list). They missed the dried cherries but otherwise got all the other ingredients and dressing correct. Salad was delicious. Everything was fresh. I ordered the petit filet but didn't want it as suggested on the menu- I got it grilled with blue cheese melted in top. O-M-G! It melted in my mouth! It was ... Epic! Lol. For sides we chose the Julia Child potatoes (cheesy goodness), asparagus (trimmed and peeled to perfection with a dab of sauce ), and French fries (hard to resist their perfect crunchiness). I would come back here in a heart beat!

We only had one night in SF and we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. We wanted a special dining experience for the occasion. So my husband did some searches and found Epic Steak online. The menu and views sold us.We were greeted warmly upon our arrival and we were wished a happy anniversary. We had an amazing table with best view of the bridge. Our server, Nashla, was attentive throughout the evening. Several members of the management team, including Amber Johnson, came by to ensure we had the best experience.And then there was the food. It was superb! From the drinks to the Caesar salad to the steak and prime rib. Everything was fresh and delicious.

I had Sunday brunch at Epic Steak in SF along the embarcadero. If you learn anything about me it should be that I love restaurants with a view (even if the food sucks). Lucky for me, Epic's food is just as amazing as its view of the bay bridge. I sat in the upstairs patio to enjoy my steak and eggs, fries and coffee. The price tag was heafty for brunch but I left with a full heart and a giant smile on my face so it was worth it. Epic serves brunch, lunch, dinner and drinks. Stop by for a great time!

I wanted to like this place, really did, but the nicest thing I can say is great view, and that's about it. The NY Strip was distinctly mediocre--definitely not "epic". Go to Ruth's Chris on Van Ness or Morton's off Union Square if you're in the city and you want a good steak. They are consistently strong. It's not that the steak here was terrible--it was just...meh. No marbling to speak of or rich beefy flavor.I also realized they messed up the orders of two persons in my party--one had ordered her steak medium-rare, the other had ordered it medium-well, and both were complaining that their respective steaks weren't cooked to order. Seems like they swapped the orders, but not sure. The sides (spaetzle, basically fontina mac and cheese; and Julia Child potatoes) were good, but neither large enough to share nor interesting--they were mac and cheese and potato gratin.Giant tourist trap. If you're looking for a nice dinner, either go get an consistently excellent steakhouse meal at Ruth's Chris or Morton's, or try some of the many Michelin-starred restaurants.

I was brought here for my birthday dinner and it was a great experience. The people that work here are amazing because they smile, laugh, and make conversation with you. It doesn't feel like they're just there for work, because it's a great restaurant. The feel of the interior is definitely classy and just makes you feel comfortable. The industrial type of design inside (water wheel of some sort?) looks really cool and the view of the Bay Bridge? You can't beat that.Experience: I arrived here, sat next to the window downstairs in the living roomish area. I ordered the potatoes, 12oz steak, and had dessert. If you have the definition of gourmet, it better be EPIC steak. The steak was huge! I added mushrooms and it was a great choice. The Julia potatoes were something not from this world, it was so soft and buttery. Let's just say it is definitely worth the cheat day. 10/10 would enjoy steak here again!Compliments to the chefs working here!

I saw the staff bringing blankets to customers who were cold- nice touch! As for food, I had the 9 oz filet which was cooked perfectly. The Julia's Child potatoes were phenomenal and my favorite part of the meal. The roasted carrots were great as well. They gave us 4 types of steam sauce but I wasn't a fan of any of them. I chose the build your own sundae for dessert and it was good- not anything special but still tasty. The staff was great and prompt.

You really are paying for beautiful views, and not the best food. I do have to say that I made an appetizer and side dishes a meal. Even if I just ordered an appetizer and 2 sides, I still paid a good amount of money. I should have just ordered an entree. I ordered the foie gras appetizer, some type of rich potato dish (can't remember the name) and broccolini. The foie gras was small and it wasn't cheap. For a very small portion of foie gras, I believe it was at least 25 dollars. Yes, it's to be expected. I just miss the portions in Europe. I really didn't think it was a good piece of foie gras. The potato dish was very rich and cheesy. I barely could eat a quarter of it. The broccolini was okay. The food was not memorable. All I can remember was how beautiful the view was. How sad!

This review is way over due. I went there a few times, and every time I told myself the food and service is going to get better...but, I made a mistake again last night with a couple of my friends who were visiting from out of state. When we got there, the waitress didn't show up until 15-20 minutes, just to give us water and bread. And we had to call her to give us the menu and service. My friend's wife shared a T-bone steak with my wife. They requested it to be medium done, but it came out welllll done. In the end, I wouldn't give this place a try again. I Would not recommend to come to this "epic" place, which was horrible. There are much better alternatives near by, which is in walking distance with the same views and way better service.

Not really as good as the name suggests. I went here with my sister when she was visiting. To be fair, it seems to be tricky to find a good steak in SF unless you go to a place known for steak. I assumed epic would fall into that category but it strikes me as a touristy spot.He view is nice and the outdoor seating is a plus but I ordered a ribeye medium rare and, while they got the order right the steak was pretty tough. For the price I was very disappointed in quality.

EPIC has the best restaurant view in San Francisco. With sparkling water, the glimmering light show of the Bay Bridge and sweeping panoramas, it's hard not to fall in love instantly.When I was visiting San Francisco, I visited EPIC for dinner with family. The food is standard for a steakhouse. My uncle loved the rib eye, and I opted for the pork shank. We started with the lobster bisque and shrimp cocktail, which did not disappoint! The food is pricy for the already pricy San Francisco, but the service in the restaurant was top notch. The staff were very knowledgable and engaging, and I always appreciate when the service is fast.The inside of the restaurant was physically really warm, which seemed a little odd given the lovely weather outside. This can be a pet peeve, as I'd always rather be a little chilly than hot. Regardless, EPIC also has an outdoor patio that overlooks the water, and you cannot beat the chic vibe it exudes. Would love to come back here for happy hour and enjoy the view!

Love this spot! The view is amazing of course. Night time is my favorite near the windows to be able to watch the light show at the bridge. I would recommend the filet deal. It comes with veggies and potatoes. My boyfriend had just the steak and sides which wasn't as cost effective. Also, the mac and cheese is simply addicting. Perfect date night spot. Brunch on the weekend is awesome too! Just to note, the upstairs patio isn't huge, so if you are planning a Happy Hour I would recommend going as early as possible.

The service is top notch and my go-to dinner of a petite filet has always been just right. The cook is right on point and the sides are tasty. They also have a chocolate cake that is amazing!! This has become my favorite treat when I'm in town.

Stopped by here after drenching myself in lake water from dragon boat practice, and I loved the atmosphere, drinks, and bites!Despite being poorly dressed and frazzled, they settled me down by some heated lamps and let me enjoy the bay view (:Loved the jumbo shrimp cocktail, steak tartare, bourbon flights (Yum!), and my white sour dog!

The BEST STEAK HOUES in the bay area. Its was my first time and can't wait to come back! I Frist the service is 5 stars ! The Food is outstanding the atmosphere great and and views of the bay and the Bay Bridge were breath taking ! I ordered the Epic meal for myself and my Wife. The steak and crab trio was the best I've had. Also we order the carrots and fries, They were a blast too ! And The desert was to die for! I recommenced Epic to all !

Bloody Mary Review - When "epic" is already in the name, my job is easy. The EPIC Bloody Mary features Charbay "Meyer Lemon" vodka, housemade bloody mary mix, and a huge helping of charcuterie garnish. A volcanic rock salt rim complements a luscious tomato juice and pleasant spice. Served in a towering glass, this statement drink brings epic to any brunch table. Why go? Charcuterie epicness. | Price: $15

First of all the view is breathtaking. The service was impeccable. Great wine selection and the steaks were amazing and this is coming from someone who has lived in Texas for 24 years. I know good steak. Go to Epic for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends. You won't regret it

Let me start with this, four years ago, went here for the first time with wife. We loved it. Never had an opportunity to do so again until about a week ago. I kept referring to it as Epic Roast house, but Epic Steak kept coming up. The name change should have tipped me off to ownership change. First off, they got rid of mashed potatoes. As a replacement they came up with their own concoction of potatoes (which on its own would be "ok"), but that was the only potato option that I remember. I said, no big deal, the amazing steak will make up for it. That goes to my second point. Each couple ordered the same steaks, so two well done, and two medium well. No two steaks were the same. My friend ended up not even finishing his steak due to how salty it was. Not to mention, my steak looked nor tasted anything like it did when I came here the first time. Let's not forget, the sizes for each were noticeably different. Thoroughly disappointed, and slightly embarrassed for making reservations well in advance, and overhyping to our friends. Doubt I'll be eating there anytime in the foreseeable future.

Visiting from San Diego for 3 yr anniversary. We came out here for brunch because we heard the view from the restaurant of the bay bridge was amazing. This is definitely true!The brunch steak plate I ordered was a big thumbs up. Service was also above and beyond.Waiter was attentive and brought out a complimentary chocolate dessert plate for our anniversary. We're definitely coming back for a huge steak dinner!

Updated review
On my 2nd visit, everything was perfect! The service and the quality of food 5/5.Brian had reached out to me from a past experience that was not so pleasant. I appreciated this gesture as all restaurants should do it, but don't.I came for brunch.BBQ oysters - bomb! I had 2 of these. Must get. Egg dish- delishBurger- OMG this was so good!! You have to get this. Cooked and prepared to perfection! The fries were great as well.The Ice cream- I needed 2, could only hold down 1. And they have a brunch special where it was pretty cheap for a whole bottle of Champagne with your choice of a mixer. That plus a view on a Sunday is a winner in my books. A perfect spot to take friends from out of town. Just make sure you get a outdoor seat. Cheers.

Epic restaurant has a warm ambiance with a beautiful view of the bridge. This is a nice restaurant that isn't pretentious. I sat at the bar enjoying the Embarcadero, warm weather and view. I enjoyed a local IPA and the Asian style chicken wings. The bartenders were really friendly. Great place for a drink. I need to go back for lunch or dinner.

we have been coming here since it opened and have never been disapointed. The food was beautiful as always, we had steaks and they were cooked perfectly. Great food. Excellent service. Fantastic view. Something for everyone.

Clearly the selling point here is the view. I felt like such a tourist. I was looking for a dog-friendly brunch spot within walking distance to my place and EPIC came up as one of the search results.We sat down with Benji at one of the tables outside and browsed the menu. I ended up ordering the Crab Benedict and he got Chilaquiles with Shrimp. When it came out, we both agreed that mine was better. I would say it was solid 4 star good; the best part was the biscuits.I also tried my date's Bloody Mary. I'm not really into Bloody Marys but it seemed alright.For some reason, we decided to end our brunch with dessert. We ordered the Blueberry Crisp (the description made it sound like a cobbler/crumble/crisp). This is where the meal fell apart. It was one of the worst desserts I've had, ever. It felt like an amateurish attempt by a recent culinary school grad to show that he can deconstruct a dessert and put pretty glazes on a plate. It was a hot mess. The best part of it was the "ricotta sushi," which was a tiny bit of ricotta ice cream wrapped in some fruit jelly ("seaweed").When the server asked us how the dessert was, we told her it was not what we expected. She then said that the staff had given the kitchen the same feedback and it was a new item that they were still evaluating. She offered to take the dessert off the check, which was nice, but we declined.Since my date always pays, I decided it was my turn to get the bill. I should've picked a cheaper place. The overall experience we had was not worth $110.

Honestly I'm very disappointed. I thought this would be a great experience because it got good reviews and was crowded. However, I was wrong. First, the service was so slow... the workers were clearly not prepared and DIDNT DO THEIR JOBS RIGHT. It took them about 30 mins to bring our food out, and we had to ask for the FREE bread and butter! When the food came out, I wanted to punch someone in the face. The wagyu burger was dry as $#!+, the asparagus wasn't seasoned enough, they didn't bring the avacado we asked for, and the coke was flat. When a restaurant doesn't even have good soda, you know it's trash. The only good part of the meal was my filet mignon. Also, the dishes are so overpriced it's retarded. If you're feeling depressed and want to waste all of your money on a not so good medal with bad service then come to this place! Epic steak??? More like epic FAIL

Perfect refuge on a rainy day. Sit inside, stare at the bridge, drink, eat some fries. Repeat.Cool spot to hit up on a sunny day as well. Def hit this spot up, and avoid Water Bar (where they're full of themselves and have poor service). I'd just order apps at Epic tho, and vino. Enjoy the view. Have some bread. It's yummy. Drink. Stare at the bridge thru your wine glass. You feel me, just relax.

I loved our dinner at Epic Steak. Took my husband to celebrate his birthday and we had a "craft your own salad" that we split, and we each got steaks. Steaks were cooked to order and very tender and flavorful. We got the "Julia Child" Potatoes which are like scalloped potatoes and roasted baby carrots with dill creme fraiche (my favorite dish!). Hubby ordered a "build your own Epic Sundae" for dessert which they very kindly comped for his birthday. I had the chocolate caramel bar which was really good. It was very rich and satisfying. Service was great, location and views are great! I don't have a single complaint and would happily go back here again.
