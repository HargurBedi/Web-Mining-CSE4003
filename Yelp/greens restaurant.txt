I'm sorry (and I recognize people can have a bad day) but dang - the individual working the front door was so rude (7 pm SAT 10/21/17) wow! Okay so we got that it's a private event that prevented us from having a meal but after the experience at the door we would never come back; at least have some suggestions as to where a hungry person can eat or just be at least respectful - you are the hostess?! I thought the very foundation of your job is to be helpful and greet people - I must be confused.I guess when you are a place this fancy (and "busy") you don't need to care anymore.

had a great meal - had a vegetarian family member visit, and this was our chance to try Greens.Loved the spinach ravioli, spring roll was pretty good, quinoa cakes were okay the side sauces made them really, and the corn chowder was good.Liked the huge drink selection, alcohol & non.Desserts were NOM! Plum tart was great, flourless choc torte balanced well with caramel ice cream but a bit sweet for me, espresso mousse was crazy...intense & good.Service was tops, we got the coveted window table & watched the sun set over the GG bridge. Most tables have a nice view, but ask for a table by the windows if you make a res, which is recommended. Parking is no longer free, pay box thingy, but still cheap for SF.

Simply beautiful. Great presentation, great wine selection, lovely desserts and baked goods. The service is definitely above fair but the views make up for absolutely everything! The opening fair of grilled figs, goat cheese, balsamic and melon was divine. I actually could've just had that.

Have not been here for years! I feel like they have upped their vegan game (used to be a cheese & egg heavy), for which I am gratefulCame a few minutes before 5:30 on a lovely sunny day & TONS of peeps were already waiting! So glad we had reservationsGot a table by the window. Lovely view of the Golden Gate Bridge, boats & FROLICKING SEA LIONS! That was delightful Food was good. Fancy. And $$$ My kid had $30 ravioli. Good wine list & fun cocktailsGreat service. Attentive but not annoying. Our server was able to explain which dishes could be veganized (most of them). Had an AMAZING chocolate mousse & coconut sorbet. Super rich, had to split it with the hubby Although I'll still end up at Millenium more often for fancy veg meals, Greens is going back on the list!

The view is best part. The food is solid. But the service was pretty bad. One needs to ask for things multiple times until it's addressed. The place feels like a casual cafeteria even though it's priced like a fancy chic restaurant. Since the view is best during the day - better to take your out-of-town friends during the day and book way in advance. For the food, the pupusas was pretty original - eggs and cheese and summer squash in tortilla wrapping. I liked the salsa sauce. The mushroom barley soup is more like a homemade soup - quite good. One visit every 3 years is probably the right frequency. Weekends can be a mob scene. Dinner food was a bit better than lunch. Skip the pizza here - the dough is made of a different material and firmer than the normal version - just doesn't taste good. Try the appetizer sampler. We had a version without fromage blanc and I really liked the vegetables. The rose from Portugal by the glass was pretty good.

This was one of the best dinners I've had in my life. Found this place online while looking for vegetarian restaurants in the city and we were not disappointed. Food - AMAZING. Unlike a lot of vegetarian places or vegetarian options I usually see, Greens did not have any sort of fake meat on the menu, which I VERY much appreciated. They really focused on the veggies, grains, and other flavors to make the most amazing food with no hint of meat. I had the grilled peaches to start and then split the green curry, spinach ravioli, and quinoa chili with the table. The highlights were definitely the curry, which had a very authentic and rich flavor, and the quinoa chili, which was crafted in such a way where all the flavors seemed to melt together beautifully. For dessert I tried the sorbets and the espresso dessert, both of which did not disappoint. Views - Windows cover a whole wall of the restaurant and we got there early enough (about 5:30) to sit right next to them. Although the restaurant was still very warm from the heatwave outside, one benefit was that the sun was a beautiful reddish-pinkish color as it set, giving the whole restaurant a pink glow and adding to the simple ambience of the place.

Best vegetarian restaurant that I have been to. Nice selection of options and a great setting. Greens has a very good ambiance. We had a great view of the sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay from our table.For appetizers would recommend the fall sampler and the grilled knoll farm figs. Fall sampler has a nice combination of grains and seasonal vegetables. The appetizers are somewhat small so would recommend ordering a few.For dinner would recommend the gratin and poblano chili. Both were delicious and filling! The dessert selection was also great.This is a perfect spot for a vegetarian date night. The selection of options would also be enjoyable for non-vegetarians

Fort Mason in itself is really cool! Embracing the arts and culture San Francisco has to offer while repurposing an old military base. You even have a pretty darn good view of the gold gate bridge and the bay!When entering this restaurant your eye automatically gets drawn to the amazing wood craftsmanship this place has to offer! Beautiful dinning pieces made out of wooden works of art.The view of the Golden Gate Bridge makes this place worth it. The food and service is spectacular. From the appetizers, main course to the dessert everything was well presented and pleasing to the eye and taste buds.I recommend coming to this fabulous dining spot during sunset!

Great recommendations from two vegetarian friends. We came on a Tuesday lunch. Was able to get a reservation for party of 5, a week in advance. When we got there at noon, was not too full. Very nice atmosphere, relaxed earthy chic. The view of the harbor and Golden Gate Bridge was amazing. Service was great, very polite and attentive. Parking was easy and cheap.The food was very good. We tried every entree on the seasonal menu (minus the Sampler) and a few appetizers. Our highlights were:- Potato Griddle Cakes (wish there were more than 3 pieces)- Black Bean Chili - very tasty even for a meat lover like me!)- Asparagus pizza - hubby loved it even though he doesn't like asparagus, says the cheese masked it.- Portobello burger- Pappardelle (pasta with cream sauce, spinach and morel mushrooms) - this was really yummy. Light, not over or under seasoned and pasta cooked perfectly.- We also had the Genmaicha, which was very good.For a meat lover, I was very happy with this totally vegetarian meal. Will definitely be back.

When Millenium moved to the East bay, I thought my fancy healthy dairy-free needs would never be met again in San Francisco. Enter: Greens, filling my void completely. Unbelievable views, friendly and helpful staff, and light & delicious dishes that make you forget about meat completely. I had a lovely evening at Greens drinking a bottle of red wine and eating excellent spring rolls, hummus & parpardelle before topping it all off with an out-of-this-world vegan strawberry almond cake (and I don't even like fruity cakes!). I can't believe I've never been here before in my 6 years in San Francisco - I'll definitely be back.

Greens is a delicious vegetarian restaurant at Fort Mason. I stopped by for brunch here, and I was not disappointed. It's general brunch fare, but there are some more unique dishes in the menu. We ordered the ciabatta French toast, pinnacles scramble, and pupusas and shared all of them. The portion sizes are perfect- three dishes for three people was enough. The French toast was quite good, but it wasn't anything particularly special. Then pupusas were my person favorite- they come topped with egg and a perfectly runny yolk, as well as some pickles vegetables and plantain. The pinnacles scramble was also very good- it had some pumpkin seeds which added a nice crunch. I also tried the elderflower fizz cocktail which was extremely refreshing! The prices here are a bit high for regular brunch food, but you are also paying for a nice ambience and lovely view of the marina. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious vegetarian meal!

We went to this fabulous vegetarian restaurant the night before our return to NY.The thin summer squash/ pesto pizza was so delicious and so was spinach ravioli. We wanted to save "room" for dessert and were happy we did. We had a chocolate torte with caramel icecream and a highly recommended almond cake with blackberry sorbet. Both were so exquisitely delicious. The restaurant has amazing views over the bay and the golden gate bridge. It is very peaceful inside with interesting furniture carved out of redwood trees. The service is excellent.We will definitely be back!

Amazing for vegans! Amazing for anybody, really. If your whiney meat-loving friend can't find something here they like, then reconsider your friendship.Plenty of vegan as-is options on the menu, and many more items can be made vegan if you ask! Our fantastic server knew every substitution option for every item on there by heart and remembered our dietary preferences the whole meal (bread with olive oil instead of butter, etc.) despite being super busy.I just wish this place wasn't such a trek from the east bay so I could come more!

I just re-visited Greens with a vegetarian friend, and we both really enjoyed it. Lovely atmosphere (including views of the harbor/bay-you may wish to time your visit to include sunset), very good food, friendly and attentive service, fairly priced for this kind of restaurant, and convenient metered parking in Fort Mason.

**We would like to preface that this review is from a couple of flexitarian individuals :) The view and the atmosphere of the dining area were superb. These reasons alone would be the top reasons to visit the restaurant. The friendly service and calm ambiance made for an extremely relaxed supper experience. We knew that it was a restaurant with a particular type of cuisine so we came here with no certain expectations other than the knowledge that we would probably hit our recommended servings of fruits and veg for that day.Unfortunately we were not particularly blown away by any of the dishes. The ingredients were extremely fresh on their own but the dishes altogether were not unique or satisfying (flavor-wise). The dishes were lacking in flavor although the natural flavors of the super fresh ingredients stood out on their own. What we ordered! :Cheese Plate: the 3 cheeses that we tried (lamb chopper, cavatina, picolo) were mild and nuttySpring Rolls: both the peanut sauce and spring rolls were unflavorfulLettuce, Little Gems and Arugula: great fresh veggies made the dish lovelyQuinoa Griddle Cakes: delicious small cakes with decent flavors. Butternut Squash and Sweet Potato Gratin: the gratin was spiced well and was another dish that made the dining experience worthwhile. Chocolate Mousse with Coconut Sorbet: the chocolate mousse was rich and dense. The accompanying sorbet gave the dish a nice balance. They also provided whipped cream upon request - thank you! The view was memorable and the food was extremely fresh. Most of the dishes lacked overall flavor (except the natural flavors of the fresh vegetables, of course) and seemed plain overall. Great one time experience but there are a growing number of other options in the bay area.

Great service. Easy parking. Amazing food. Gorgeous view. I mean, my God, it's total victory. Dishes are creative and delicious. Tonight we ordered corn chowder, fresh spring rolls and the sampler platter with butter beans, spring peas, radish, warm cauliflower. French wine rec from the waiter was perfect. Highly recommend the flourless chocolate cake and almond cake. It has become a favorite meeting spot for friends visiting from out of town. Note: Star is simply a price thing. It's steep. Worth it, but pricey.

TLDR: set expectations low for food, prepare to pay, get a window seat and enjoy the view. This review is based on the service and food. If you get a window seat, you'll find the view fantastic, but there isn't much reason to go besides the view.I love vegetarian and vegan food, and although the food was tasty, it wasn't anything you couldn't get from the local Thai place (at 1/3 of the price). I'm not sure how they are billed as creative, but it was very standard fare. I had the green curry. My wife had the Mesquite Vegetable & Rice. Spring rolls for starters. Staff: half of them super friendly, but otherwise uninterested and somewhat surly. Nobody even asked how our meal was.Strange experience. Bit of a let down.

My family and I went out to dinner tonight at Greens. The food was outstanding. We had several appetizers (my favorites were the cauliflower cakes and the hummus) and the dinner was great too. The sorbet dessert was delicious! As for service, the hosts working this evening were excellent, our server Seth was very attentive and the perfect balance of interactive (offered to take a picture and laughed at my dad's bad jokes) and let us dine in peace.All in all, the service here is out standing, as someone who's worked in the industry it's like striking gold when you find good service. From hosts, to food runner to our serve, we weren't let down. And the food of course, was outstanding. Definitely have my new favorite restaurant!

From the moment you walk into Greens, you'll start realizing why it's among the top 100 restaurants in the bay area. Get ready for breath taking views of the marina and Golden Gate Bridge and wait till you savor the absolutely gorgeous local, organic, vegetarian cuisine that makes carnivores second guess their lifestyle for the duration of the meal. The menu is constantly changing but it's always impressive and memorable with sophisticated ingredients and an international flair that keeps you coming back and never disappointed. My favorite time to come is during the weekend brunch, fog or no fog, as the floor to ceiling windows let in natural light and warmth. Some of my favorite items have been the pancakes, french toast, polenta, and mushroom grilled cheese sandwich. Their wine list is not to be missed but I was perfectly happy with coffee and fresh squeezed blood orange mimosa. Free Parking!!!

My friend and I visited Greens Restaurant during Fleet Week for a terrific view of the air show. I definitely suggest grabbing a table by the window to marvel at a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge and East Harbor. This is a superb date spot, especially if your reservation time is in line with the sunset.// Mesquite Grilled Brochettes ($19) - 5 starsIt was great how there were so many different types of vegetables on this brochette. The fruit-almond couscous and carrot slaw on the side were on point as well. My friend had a minor gripe with the corn cob on the skewer. According to him, bare hands shouldn't be used for eating brunch food. Needless to say, I just happily munched away.// Pupusas ($18.50) - 4 starsThe pupusas themselves were very good, although the cabbage-cauliflower slaw was sort of a weird side. It didn't add much to the dish, unlike the avocado and fried plantains.// Fruit bowl with Hamada Farm plums, strawberries, blackberries, and charentais melon ($8.50) - 2 starsVery underwhelming, especially for the hefty price tag.// Mango Black Iced Tea ($5) - 4 starsI wish the mango taste were more prevalent, but it was still good.// South African Mint Herbal Iced Tea ($5) - 5 starsRefreshing and invigorating! Order this on a sunny day out.

It's a bit difficult to find the place and we waited for a bit as a party of 6 but it was worth the wait for sure. The food was incredible, it was very seasonal with a minimal amount of fuss or snobbery. I loved everything I tasted and their menu is very eclectic, from African to regional SF cuisine style and European, I love the variety. If I had to say I wanted something else it would be the portions. They are quite small and you won't know this until the food arrives and you realize you are HUNGRY by the end of the meal. If I return I know to get an appetizer or 2 and a soup or salad and then an entree. I definitely recommend that you try this place if you are vegetarian or vegan it will be very satisfiying.

Meh. I had such high hopes for this place and have had it on my "must do" list for six months now, but after visiting I'm not sure what all the hype is about.The short of it is that you'll pay steak like prices for veggies, and steak like prices for small portions, too. That really confused me!The obvious draw to the Greens if you're a vegetarian (I'm not, but do like to throw in meals sans meat) is that it's a whole restaurant with no restrictions. There is a great mix on the menu of flavors and cuisines, so to those who struggle with having options for dinner you'll definitely like the choice here.The food, though, while great in concept just really failed to meet the mark for me. I found the quinoa and cauliflower fritters to have virtually no seasoning and felt they didn't hold up to being a fritter since they fell apart everywhere. The spring rolls were also disappointing- the coconut peanut dipping sauce had no peanut flavor, which you really need to tie the dish together.The mains were good, however, at $24-$28 a pop I would expect to be blown away by flavor and texture and that was not the case.The best main we had was probably the shepherd's pie- it's basically mashed potatoes and caramelized onions on top of a portobello mushroom (yes, one portobello mushroom and the cheapest vegetables on the planet for $27), but it was pretty tasty. The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. We split an apple galette and a butterscotch pot de creme, both of which were really good. All of the desserts looked amazing on other people's plates so that might be the hidden gem of this place.If you're looking for the novelty of having an entire upscale vegetarian restaurant I would give it a try but other than that I'm not sure there's a reason to spend a ton of $$$ on non-amazing food.

Vegan Shepard's pie (allow for 30 mins) is delish BUT you'll leave hungry if that's all you order (pricy for the portion). Order a spring roll app (that peanut sauce....wow) and a side of sweet potatoes (they can do it vegan) & you'll walk out satisfied.

This is a MUST if you're in the SF area. I've been here twice, and each time I am very impressed. Their seasonal menu, and the tasty fresh ingredients that goes into each dish results in a very satisfying meal. You really cannot go wrong with anything that you order. It is obvious the Chef pays attention to the details, and knows well which ingredients pair well together. The wine selections are also very good. I had a nice German Riesling the first time (January 2017) and was sad not to find it on the menu a couple of months later (July 2017) but the red wine our table ordered was also very rememberable. Last but not least, THE VIEW! The Greens Restaurant has a stunning view of the Golden Gate Bridge during the tasty meal which I love having two of anything for the price of one!

Although this restaurant has a great atmosphere (of course the view is amazing), lovely food and presentation, there is nothing which stands out for me. The food, although good, lacked a "wow" factor in terms of flavor profile. The best part of my meal was the freshness of the spring rolls and salad. The dessert came out with a candle, which was nice, but wasn't served warm like promised.My partner mentioned having difficulty contacting the restaurant to make reservations or ask for a window seat for my special birthday dinner. When there, the staff were nice but it seemed some other guests were becoming frustrated. Would I go again? Sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way.

Although you are not generally a fan of vegetables, it doesn't matter. You can enjoy this restaurant totally.Three reasons why you should go: 1. Food I'm meat lover and I thought vegetable only dishes are not my cup of tea but, this restaurant changes my mind!!. All dishes I had are not only creative but also TASTY.I ordered Green corn soup, Mesquite Grilled Brochettes, and Flourless Chocolate Torte. The soup is creamy and main dish is savory. Especially, I liked taste of orange sauce.The dessert is not too sweet and a piece of cake goes with ice cream perfectly!Maybe, some of dishes might not be served now because they try to change menus monthly based on seasonal ingredients. However, Mesquite Grilled Brochettes is one of popular dishes in this restaurant, so I think you can find on the menu. You can check monthly menu on the website. 2. Nice View I sat by the window and I could enjoy beautiful scenery of port while I was having dinner. Also, the neighborhood where this restaurant is located is well known for nice sunset view. If you go here for dinner, you can enjoy beautiful sunset.3. Service Service is good. Even though staffs are busy all the time, they try to find what we need and serve ASAP. Maybe, one of these things might be your pet peeves:1. You have to make a reservation.Even though I went here on weekday, the tables are full. If you want to go here because of important day, you have to make a reservation to make sure. 2. The place is a little noisy.There are so many people, so the place is little noisy to talk, but I think they have private rooms.I was really satisfied and had wonderful time in here. I want to go again and try other dishes.I highly recommend this place! You won't regret!

This place is very expensive for what you get and completely ordinary. I am not a vegetarian so I had no business being here in the first place but I was invited by my friend was is vegetarian as is his wife. I did not know until I looked at menu I was in a veggie place. I had a curry which would have been way better at half the price at a Thai place it was fine. If you are a vegetarian go for this place if you are not move on to the next place.

VEGANS AVOID! I went here for brunch while in town for just one day. There wasn't a single vegan entree. I think there was one salad and one side (hummus) that was vegan. This is basically an egg shop. Every item had eggs in it. You can sub out eggs for tofu, which is boring and uninspired and disappointing. And I don't like tofu. So I had a cold ramekin 'full' of one diced potato, a splatter of pesto water, one soggy spinach leaf, and two diced cherry tomatoes, covered in cold, what looked and tasted like canned, corn. That was my breakfast. My $20 breakfast. Left hungry and seriously disappointed (also I guess avoid on sundays? We looked for parking for nearly an hour. Parked 20-25 mins away)

Don't be lulled into thinking that, because this place specializes in vegetarian fare, that you're paying too much for a few leaves and bark scrapings. Yes, the prices might seem high at first glance, but the portions and the quality rise up to the occasion here at this large, airy, and rustic waterfront venue. The mesquite grilled brochettes, for example, were sumptuous, featuring large chunks of mushrooms, potatoes, peppers, corn on the cob, squash, onions, and tofu, all topped with a savory muhumarra sauce. A nice helping of rice and pickled beets helped catch and soak up everything that fell off the skewers. Overall, the prices, portions, and quality will satisfy even the most gluttonous carnivores out there. Service was reasonably good too. Highly recommended for a leisurely meal.

After a long walk to get here, on an unusually hot day, my mother and I were a bit hot and disheveled upon arrival. We were still dressed nicely, but a few hairs were out of place, and perhaps there was a bit of perspiration. Alas, the restaurant was pretty much empty and upon entering we were questioned if we had a reservation, and then sat in the furthest corner of the back room, even though there were roughly a million other open tables. Coincidence? I think not. Aside from the shady seating situation lets get to the food.We split the hummus plate, corn risotto cakes, and then the fennel pizza. My mother seemed satisfied but I was still rather hungry after the meal. You've been warned, the servings are smallllll. All in all, everything was delicious! I wish I had so many more of the corn risotto cakes, the sauce on the side was superb and really added to it. The pizza was nothing special, but the hummus you could tell was super fresh. Tldr; the combo of the shady seating situation, plus the whole feeling hungry thing after the meal leads me to three stars. P.S. the decor reminds me of an attempt at classing up my grandma's house in Florida...take that as you will

We took a dear friend here post Alcatraz swim to celebrate her aquatic victory! What a class act Greens is, from start to finish. They really understand 'customer focus'. We were early, so had coffee @ entrance coffee/pastry counter. The hostess came over to greet us (even though 30' before main restaurant area officially opened), make sure we were on rez list for a great view table. The waitstaff were stellar in every way, checking in, being friendly & personable. Food was stellar, as always. We've been coming since it opened in the 70s & Greens has never disappointed.

I'm honestly astounded that Greens isn't five stars across the board. When we visited in November, service was outstanding; all the team members were knowledgeable and friendly, a mix that certainly can be difficult to find. Our friend called ahead and, sure enough, the team had negronis waiting for us as we perused the menu that had been updated that day. We started with a hummus plate and a cauliflower salad, which set the bar high for the rest of the evening. I went with the mushroom phyllo tart. All I can say is WOW. My dining companions devoured their main dishes as well. We wrapped up the evening with a couple of desserts, and I would be failing if I didn't mention the wine. Again, the knowledgeable staff helped us make our pick based on our entrees. Greens is at the top of my list for when we're back in the Bay Area. Don't miss it, even if you're not a vegetarian!

The staff managing Greens' private banquet room was phenomenal. Special thanks to Mark Cartland, Brittany Barcellos, and Laura Fraenza! They run like a well-oiled engine from initial conception of the event, room setup, choice of menu, choice of wine, and other scheduling items. I received calls to discuss details when appropriate, and they chose email for simple questions or administrative tasks. The day of, when I had a couple more guests show up than I expected, the staff was absolutely flexible and understanding to set the room up slightly differently. Everyone's glasses were full at any given point (water, juice, you name it), and dishes never lingered on the table for too long before the next course. They have such a great variety of vegan or gluten free options that were just as delicious as others without allergies or further restrictions (than vegetarian, of course). Even my non-vegetarian friends were happy with their meal choices (everyone had the same starter). The room is on the bay and absolutely gorgeous view during the day, if you have your event during lunch time.

I am not a vegetarian (well not 100% lol) but as i learned the last couple of years is that you don't need that much meat. And so we went to this place that was one of Steve Jobs favorites. And i can now tell why, it is just delicious!If you have the chance to get a table, do it - really even when you are a heavy meat eater!

Food was amazing!! This place is a must for vegetarians and vegans. It may be a little pricy, but honestly it's San Francisco. Order the portobello mushroom sandwich or the pupusas. Those two are spectacular and it will fill you up for a while.

This is probably one of the best, and best known, vegetarian restaurants in the nation. I have eaten there probably ten times. I would say there has not been a single bad meal. It is always excellent ingredients, skillful preparation, and attentive service. That said, there are some less than great parts of meals. Last night, for example, the grilled polenta was dry and flavorless. The rest of the dish, a gratin, it came with, was impeccable The gratin was just a bit on the side. But it was subpar.The view also is spectacular. You can watch the sunset over the water. For some places, that is all they would be offering.The prices are not outrageous. By San Francisco standards, this place is moderately priced. By any other measure, it would be expensive. My wife is pesce-vegetarian. I am an omnivore. We always enjoy Greens. If you are a vegetarian, this would have to be, I would think, among the top choices you could find anywhere. But if you are a meat-eater, this will impress you; you would miss nothing, the menu has so many options.

Expensive and worth it.2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and 1 glass of ginger beer= $102Fresh spring roll with peanut dressing, and tiny side of mushrooms/turnip. I knew we were in for an experience when the mere smidge of turnip put me in a happy tizzy. Roasted pear salad with, blue cheese, crisp endive and greens. And hazelnuts. Hard to decide which was my favorite appetizer from these two.Oh and even the bread and butter they serve is fresh and delicious. Thank goodness we practiced restraint with it or we would not have been able to eat dinner. Chile relleno stuffed with quinoa, Fresca, and avocado. On a bed of red beans and corn. WINNER!Gratin with eggplant, squash and red peppers on a delicious sauce. Side of crisp & flavorful green beans and polenta.Hubby's wine was good (sauv blanc) and my ginger beer (with cardamom and peppers) was so refreshing with a nice little donkey kick at the end of each sip.We ate too much. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert. Next time, we're going to share an app so we can share dessert.Great venue, embience, and service. Especially service. Our guy was on POINT! Attentive but not overbearing. Just perfect.We parked next to the boats for free and had a nice 5 minute digestive stroll back to the car.

Oh my. My new favorite San Francisco restaurant, dinner was one of my top 20 all-time. The location and space is perfect for a romantic dinner, or like we did, a business group. It is not just for vegetarians- this is real gourmet food! My mushroom and leak pizza was delectable- the mushrooms, leeks, and French/Italian cheeses were perfectly complimented by arugula and an astounding crust. The deserts, including an apple galette with butterscotch ice cream, were mouth watering. My cocktail was the perfect start, along with some good apps. Not cheap by any means but in this case I can say that we got our money's worth. Bravo!

Greens is a place that I really wanted to blow me away. After looking through the menu online and reading about the chef I thought this would be a great place to grab a healthy, delicious dinner. I gathered my wife, two good friends and off we went. What we got was a 300 dollar let down. The food is just plain uninspired. It feels tired and worn out, and would be over priced at half the cost. The ambiance was really great and the crow at sunset is amazing so there's that, and our waiter, Ron, seemed genuinelyInterested in us having a great time. All that said, a restaurant needs to have delicious food for me to like it. We ordered the brochettes and the gratin for our main dish and had asparagus, polenta and hummus for sides. The best thing we had was the hummus- but it's not hard to make great hummus. The brochettes was just not good. It tastes like an idea that was revolutionary in the 70's but has aged poorly and now is just kind of meh. Like Sonny and Cher, I guess. If I had a suggestion for the chef it would be to think more about how the flavors of the dish come together. There was no theme, no story, just a pile of unseasoned rice next to some vegetables on a stick with some weird green tasteless goop on top of it. I added a star because of Ron. He's a pro, and was very good at his job.

Absolutely delicious! If you are gluten free and vegan you have options here for sure. I highly recommend the poblano chili dish when its in season! As a vegan, this is a great place to take folks who are not vegan and you would like to truly enjoy your meal, have them feel comfortable and enjoy beautiful ambiance together. I highly recommend you go at sunset! :) Enjoy! :)

If you want to score some brownie points from your vegetarian date (figure there are lots of them in SF), this is a great place to take her/him.We got the table beside the big window to bask in the view of the waterfront sunset. It was beautiful. The dimmed light and spacious venue, coupled with the big windows, really gives this restaurant a tranquil airy feeling. Go in the evening, really.I get the feeling the chef really like to play with the vegetables and influenced with different kind of cuisines. The pupusas ($15) was okay, the pickled vegetables certainly gives a refreshing opening. Although I didn't care much for the added sourness of the avocado, a bit too sharp when coupled with the pupusa itself. The Mesquito grilled brochettes ($20) was a good choice. I love grilled vegetables, and they grilled them very well. The chefs managed to bring out the flavor of the vegetables and the tofu. The muhammara sauce and the sides compliment the dish very well too. It feels like a mellow but fastidious fall. Server was nice, but more in the slow side. I mean, really slow. Thankfully, we got a bunch of convos and sunset to watch to pass the time. So you might want to be sure you get along well with your date before bringing her here, or be really good at staring contests during awkward silent first date.

Great spot located with an exceptional view of the marina. Small menu with carefully crafted vegetarian items that are perfectly flavorful and filling. The restaurant is minimal in decor, with a pleasing zen esthetic. My waitress couldn't have been a happier person. A bit in the pricey side, but with the treat.

For my 100th review, it seems appropriate that I write about my old friend, but still noteworthy, Greens. Anyone near SF who is vegetarian, or open to it occasionally, needs to make a visit to one of the OGs of elevated meatless meals. (Note they can accommodate vegans, too.) Heck, take that friend who is convinced that meat must be a part of every meal and see if you can't change his mind.Greens works on all occasions. Brunch? Check. Dinner? Of course. Out and about for a walk around the Marina? Get something from their grab-n-go counter. Reception? If you're a high-roller, rent out the back room. Great for a date night (it's been my go-to special occasion location for probably 10 years), but if you show up in a tshirt and jeans, you won't be the only one. Saturday night is prix-fixe (amuse-bouche, and a few choices each for appetizer, entree, and dessert), for which you'll generally pay a slight premium depending on what you order (but hey, it's Saturday night).There are a few staples (or variations of them) that have remained over the years: spring rolls, corn cakes, soup, curry dish, pizza, ravioli, phyllo bundle, brochettes. I've never been disappointed and I've often been enchanted. I feel like a great deal of care goes into the selection and preparation of each ingredient. During last night's visit I savored the pupusas, which had a robustly flavored stuffing that included summer squash, spring onions, and smoked cheddar. The perfectly ripe avocado balanced the spicy salsa and the acidity of the pickled veggies brought a nice change to the palate. It was at least my second time getting the gratin provencal (with sides of polenta and green beans) as my entree, which with the fromage blanc topping and garlic sauce transforms the layers of vegetables into appropriately indulgent bites. And besides a glass (or two!) of wine, you gotta explore the dessert menu. Butterscotch pot de creme for the win.The one inconsistency is service, which unfortunately doesn't always live up to the five-star rating, but it's never problematic and clearly hasn't kept me from coming back again and again.Try to get a table by the window and gaze out at the boats in the Marina and the Golden Gate Bridge. Bonus points if you're there for the sunset.

This place is pretty solid but compared to other higher end vegetarian places, it doesn't really stack up.The view is the best part! We were able to watch wildlife swim by (I saw a shark and a sea lion). It was a nice and sunny day too anticipate potentially wearing sunglasses inside like I was at some points. We ordered a couple of items. The food, again, was okay. I'm writing this a couple of days after going and the food wasn't that memorable-I do remember ordering an appetizer (the sampler, I think which was worth a try!). The other thing I do remember was the sorbet we had at the end. It was sooo good, enough for 2 people to share. But the other items, I just don't really remember what entrees we ordered :(

Honestly the view was pretty great, but the food was incredibly mediocre, and bland.my appetizer tasted like a freaking bar of soap, yuck!!!!the portions were super tiny and not filling at all we all left completely unsatisfied and We're super disappointed.what was supposed to be a great experience with my friends was a pretty disappointing one. For 5 people it costed over 400 bucks which is absolutely ridiculous for the service and food that we got. (Seriously!?) This place is a joke! I wouldn't waste your time or money coming here, completely not worth it.

Fantastic! This place is the perfect spot for vegans or vegetarians who want a fine-dining experience. Often times vegan/vegetarian restaurants have a "cafe" feel.... Not this place! It's beautiful inside, overlooking the water. We watched a seal sun bathing on the deck while we enjoyed our meal. Great wine, great food, great atmosphere!!

I love this place. Fresh, delicious, filling food in a stunning dining room. SF institution that has admirable values without self righteousness. Frequently come for long lunches and always leave satisfied and happy that I was able to eat healthfully without compromising flavor. This is a gem for spoiled locals and tourists will definitely feel like they got a real sf experience.

My husband and I checked out Greens on a chilly Friday night. We loved it! Beautiful interior, great view, lots of available parking - and we even had the added perk of dessert after our meal at Off The Grid next door. We had the cauliflower quinoa griddle cakes (our favorite), green curry, and fire-roasted poblano chili (also very good). Highly recommend!

4.8 stars, actually, but rounding up for the phenomenal customer service & concept. I found out about Greens after seeing the executive chef gathering fresh produce around the Ferry Building Farmers Market herself!Made reservations for a birthday brunch for 6 and they gave us the private nook with the view! That made the celebration a little more special. Food was healthy, tasty and satisfying, but just something short of phenomenal. Pricey, but expected for the venue and location and completely worth it for the sweeping views of the GG Bridge. Our server was fantastic and helped facilitate a seamless and enjoyable celebratory brunch.

Operated by the San Francisco Zen center, this is a remarkable restaurant that really cares about the food it serves. You can taste the freshness of the salads and the care taken in every detail--from the fresh squeezed lemon of the salad dressing to the just ground taste of the oregano in the pizza to the glorious texture of the grated Parmesan on the handmade crust. My only hesitation is the host staff. Even though we arrived on time for our Wednesday afternoon reservation, she had trouble finding our name and while the reservation was only for two she asked us both if we were all here...Ummm...What exactly kind of Zen are you practicing back there?

First off, the location of Greens is amazing. The view of the water is beautiful, and gets event better when you enjoy it with a delicious meal. I went to Greens for Saturday brunch, and be sure to make a reservation. Greens is a vegetarian restaurant, but the quality of the food is so great, that you won't miss the meat. I tried the papusas and a glass of wine, which I would definitely recommend. Another suggestions is the bread with goat cheese and heirloom tomatoes.

I've been to Greens a few times, and have always had fantastic experiences. I don't think I would ever find something on the menu which disappointed me. I've had the pizza, the stuffed pepper, the gratin provencal, and many of the starters and desserts. I won't go through each of them because they have been incredibly consistent and that would get boring. The starters are reasonably portioned, with hearty portions of cheese going onto their great local cheese plate, for example. The entrees are also large and hearty, each balanced in a way that should satisfy any omnivore's palate.The gratin provental was my most recent dinner, and the least impressive I've had here. The eggplant was very slightly undercooked, enough to make it a bit firm but definitely not hard or spongy. This meant that cutting a slice of my vegetable cylinder (which was gorgeously presented, by the way) required really digging in with my knife and fork and ruining the presentation, not that it was going to last all that long anyway. The grilled polenta was tasty, but underwhelming. I love polenta, and know that Greens emphasizes ingredient quality, which this had, but I could've sacrificed a bit of my appreciation for the sweet corn in exchange for a bit more seasoning. The green beans were good - fairly simple, but well cooked and certainly fresh and delicious.I've been told by a number of people that Greens has maintained or improved its quality over time, and I will certainly come back. It's a bit of a splurge for my wallet, but worth it for a very classy and consistent experience, a beautiful atmosphere and bay view, and great vegetarian cuisine, which many other fine restaurants in this city fail to do well.

, this is the single best restaurant we have been to and years. Our daughter who is vegetarian and vegan will only eat at certain places so we chose greens as a compromise. I would eat at this place every time I come to San Francisco as it is impeccable.

After reading most of the reviews my expectations were high, but how can a vegetarian restaurant receive 5 stars? 5 stars are reserved for Michelin and Zagat rated haute cuisine establishments.

Very good experience. I'm vegan and our server was very knowledgeable and had no problem navigating me through the menu and suggesting the best vegan options. Food was very tasty, I opted for the mushroom filo. I felt like it was the perfect size, and I had enough room to try their vegan chocolate mousse. That was delicious as well. Lastly, you can't beat the view. We were lucky enough to have a nice view of the sunset. Overall great place and definitely recommend!
