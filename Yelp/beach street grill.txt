Huge brunch portions, decent seating time, plenty of seating at 9:30 on a Saturday morning... the Habanero chicken omelette was phenomenal. Try the fresh-squeezed orange juice and the Bloody Mary!The interior decor was interesting, but it's a great place for brunch.

As we walked along Beach Street searching for food, we stumbled upon Beach Street Grill and was pretty damn happy because this place is FREAKING amazing. I personally loved the fact that they use all organic, locally produced vegetables and fruits from local farmer's markets/vendors for their menu. (Brownie points for supporting your local vendors!!!)We started off with mimosas - Y'ALL they use fresh squeezed orange juice and it changed the mimosa game. Cups are pretty darn massive too, but at $13 it's worth it. My boyfriend and I shared the Big Squeeze Cheese which was cream cheese filled french toast, topped with blackberries, strawberries and blueberries. Supeeeeeeeeeeer good, the cream cheese definitely balanced out the sweet/tart really nicely. We also ordered the huevos rancheros which is (correct me if I'm wrong) homemade tortillas with cheese, beans and topped with eggs. This meal alone had to be one of my favorites from the entire weekend. Will definitely make my way back to Beach Street Grill for their mimosas + huevos rancheros! Thanks again Beach Street, see you guys soon!

During an SF trip for a Giants game, we stopped by this spot on our way to the game to grab breakfast. This was one of the best benedicts I have ever gotten and I dream of the day when I can be reunited with it! My husband and I both got the Fresh Crab Benedict with some mimosas, and it was amazing! It was a bit pricey, but considering the area of SF it was located in, it makes sense. Still super good and I hope to visit again the next time I'm in the city!

Very good Salmon Benedict, although not a large piece of Salmon, the hollandaise was tasty and not too lemony. The hash browns were fresh and perfectly cooked and the orange juice tasted freshly squeezed. The restaurant also promotes organic and non GMO, gluten free foods!

Looks like a hole in the wall but it turned out to be a seemingly reliable breakfast spot, and even on a Fleet Week weekend it wasn't so packed that we couldn't sit outside. Service was attentive and accommodating, and the food was solid - we weren't looking for fancy or adventurous, and we got exactly the comfort staples we were looking for, some good ol scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and sourdough toast. We'll definitely try this spot again.

My co-workers and I come here every other Saturday and it's one of our favorite spots for lunch. Whenever we go they always have a table ready for us. I swear we come here for the food and service and not just because it's just down the block from us. There are so many different things to try and believe me we've tried as many items are could. They boast that a lot of their menu items are organic and you can really taste the difference. Some of the things I remember trying:San Francisco Burger with House Salad - The Nieman Ranch burger is juicy and cooked the way you like it. I usually get medium and they cooked it spot on. You get a choice of salad or fries and neither would disappoint. Their salad is made with very fresh greens with olives, sunflower seeds, carrots, and other seasonal items. Get their house dressing, it's delicious.Biscuit and Gravy - The best sausage gravy is made in house and you can definitely tell that they make it themselves from scratch. The meal comes with crispy hash browns and two eggs any way. Very good and it's my usual go to when we go there.You would think this place is very touristy with its location, but believe me it's definitely worth visiting if you're in the area.

Came here this morning. Our server was very friendly and quick. I ordered the gluten free pancakes combo with bacon and scrambled egg whites The pancakes were delicious and eggs were cage free and so fluffy. My friend ordered one of their omelettes and steel cut oatmeal which were both delicious as well. Being gluten intolerant, it was so great to find gluten free options that were tasty. They even had sugar free pancake syrup. The cost was a little pricier than other breakfast places, but the quality was great and when in vacation, I expect to pay a little more for good service and food.

What are they trying to achieve here decor wise? I have to write about it. It's disturbing when decors are seemingly confused. Latin? And??Anyways, pricey breakfast. Organic ingredients. They seem to push that every chance they can. Like explaining why they're pricey. I get it. Duh. But $5 for fruit toppings on a pancake? Your choice. Wrong gal. I'm not that organic crazy. It's a place within walking distance from the Sheraton. So. Yeah. Excellent service. Clean.

Definitely not worth your money & time. They repeatedly said "oh this is organic" & "house made." Regardless if it were, the meals were bland AF. Also, the "homemade" whip cream and lemonade tasted store bought. Therefore, the extra cost for them were ridiculous. The hostess was all over the place & very unorganized. While we were 2nd on the list she was saying how we were next, but repeatedly kept taking in other parties. She was also trying to manage orders at the same time while hosting. They didn't seem to be short in staff and it wasn't busy at all. At one point she cut off our server when he was about to take our order. She told US TO WAIT so that she can place a different order. Like no, don't tell us to wait. If you're gonna take orders and act as a waitress then have a notepad on you instead of telling our waiter. Not to mention she was the one stating how everything was organic and freshly made. She said the lemonade is freshly made so it would be on the sour side. It was not sour what so ever, it tasted like a soda machine lemonade. I had more refreshing tart-tasting lemonades than this place.On to the food, like I said they were very bland. We had to repeatedly add salt & pepper to our hash browns and eggs. And I RARELY add salt to my food, but at this place I did. I ordered their famous corned beef which tasted like nothing. That shit needed to be seasoned. LOL. Last, their pancakes were very dense and not fluffy at all. They say food tastes better when you're hungry, hahaha but not this place.

Solid breakfast at the Warf!Once in a while, when tourists are not flooding my neighborhood, I dare wonder into the Warf and try a new place to eat. I have been here twice for breakfast and both times I have been very happy. The omelettes are nicely done and tasty, the coffee is good and so is the service. This time around our server was Rene who suggested I try the California Omelet. Good choice. Rene was very nice and pleasant. She kept refilling our coffees (always a good thing!) and was sweet enough to have a short chat with us when doing it.Good place, will definitely visit again.

Good menu with lots of options. Was a little more pricey than I'd expect for the selections and, sadly, not one refill on the lemonade. What would I expect for a restaurant a couple blocks from the wharf? Still it's better than the over-promising and under-delivering restaurants that are heavy on tourists.

We stopped into this little restaurant after getting off of the trolley at the wharf. We were looking for some breakfast to eat on the go, as we didn't have much time before we had to head back catch a flight home. As we walked up to the outside patio (which was very cute and welcoming) we were treated right away by a friendly server. She asked us if we'd like to grab a seat. We explained our time frame and desire to site see as much as we could in our limited timeframe. She was very sweet and offered us a table inside to sit at while we looked over the menu and put in a to go order. She suggested the breakfast sandwich, which we ordered on sourdough. It was fantastic. She rushed our order in and out of the kitchen in no time and had us out the door with food in hand and directions to a near by amphitheater where we could eat and look out at the Golden Gate Bridge. I would definitely eat at this establishment again. Our server made all the difference that morning.

Great service! Our waitress was very cheerful and attentive. However the food was way overpriced and like the previous reviews state was it really *that* fresh? Just throwing some veggies in the middle of eggs and calling it an omelette is not going to fly with me.

We almost passed this place by, but we're so glad we didn't!! We came in for lunch 15 minutes before they closed and they welcomed us in. My daughter and I are gluten free & finding places to eat while traveling can be difficult. But not here, they have delicious options: pancakes, French toast, salads, sandwiches. My daughter was in heaven to finally have really good French toast. Thank you! You made her week. And the food was absolutely delicious probably because it all is organic too. My husband had the clam chowder and said it was the best he's ever had -- even the grilled cheese on sourdough bread was amazing. And the staff is so friendly!!We will definitely recommend Beach Street Grill to our friends and family who visit San Francisco!

Family had breakfast at about 10:45am on a Monday. Place was pretty empty, service was polite and accommodating. "Delivery truck hadn't made it yet" so was served mini ground pork patty sausage. Was gross, tasted like greasy hamburger. Luckily truck showed up and we were made their normal link sausage. The link sausage was great! Heavy rosemary flavor, so beware if that's not your favorite. We ordered the special pancakes, Italian omelette, and 2 eggs/sausage. All were very good. Staying at a nearby hotel, this was a great stop for breakfast instead of eating in the hotel.

ATTITUDE!! Didn't even stay to try the food! Bloody Mary's listed at 10.95 cash or 12.95 paid with a credit card, but that is only if you are waiting in line for a table. You can sit down for a $20 breakfast and then the Bloody Mary is$12.95 regardless cash or credit. We were told it is because the restaurant is all organic. Fine. We would have paid the $12.95 but why should we if the price is advertised $10.95. We were told if we did not like it we could leave.Restaurant was recommended by our hotel concierge. We were looking forward to trying it but I can't enjoy my meal if I feel I am being ripped off. We ended up around the corner at The Hollywood Cafe where I felt like a valued customer. (Taylor and North Pointe) We had for a wonderful breakfast complete with Bloody Mary's.

I went here for breakfast this past weekend. From the beginning I was not happy .... we stood outside and waited while other parties that got there after us were taken in right away! Food was very good but overpriced especially the drinks!! I believe in a good tip for good service, with that said our customer service was horrible our waiter came to our table maybe once or twice and was very short with us and in a rush.

I'm a total food snob. I like good fresh local and organic food. I really wanted to love this place. Unfortunately it was like cheap diner food. The crab Benedict hardly had crab and my eggs were super soggy and raw like after I specially asked for them cooked "hard". My partner's hash was unappealing with raw potatoes and his side of hash browns were barely golden when asked for cooked extra. Our bacon was old and stale. I gave them 1 star because the pancakes were tasty though I believe the maple syrup was not real. I do appreciate the fact that they are trying. However the quality is just not there.

I work nearby and five years ago I came into this place with my colleague for a nice breakfast. This place is fantastic. The food is always made with fresh ingredients; you can tell because the kitchen is pretty visible in this small space. I am obsessed with their biscuits. The real star of this place, though, is the people who work there. Being a regular, they treat me like a good friend. If I ever feel down about work or just burnt out, I know I can go here and see pictures of the server's babies and have a really satisfying breakfast.It's a block off of the wharf but is never over-crowded. If you're hitting the tourist spots but want to sit down for a breather and some really tasty grub, go here. You won't regret it.I'm just sad my department is moving offices down to Civic Center. But I know I'll make a special trip to the BSG whenever I'm in the area.

The people here are super friendly and it makes me sad to leave a bad review but here goes... I went there specifically for the gluten free French toast. I've had some pretty terrific GF French toast so I guess I'm a bit spoiled. This place was not one of those places. It was not only not worth the regular price but it was insulting to add $2.95 to each "gluten free special order" because it fell so very short from being "special". My husband had the gluten free burger more for solidarity than anything and he liked his but I should clarify, he has eaten a live earth worm and liked it so I can't really consider his review in this. I would say he doesn't have taste but he married me!

I came here for breakfast one morning. I have to eat gluten free and was excited to find a place that offers gluten free options close by to where I was staying. The inside is very dated. The server was very friendly, but the wait for the waters, food, etc was kind of long. The price was very expensive for what we got. It was my mom and I eating and the bill was around $50, such an expensive breakfast! The food was good, but not amazing. We both ordered the gluten free pancakes. I got mine with berries and whip cream on top. It only came with pancakes and no sides. I didn't order any additional sides.I saw one guy come in for a cup of regular coffee to go. They were charging him $2.50 for the coffee and as he tried to pay with his card the server told him it was cash only. The guy only had $1.50 so they sent him away and told him to get coffee somewhere else. I felt bad for the guy. I then asked the server if it was cash only because all I had was a card and he said "no we accept credit cards". I'm not sure why he told the guy 5 minutes prior that they didn't.Overall if I was back in the area and needed a gluten free option I would return. Otherwise, there is better food elsewhere for less of a price.

We had the biscuits and gravy with potatoes, eggs, side of bacon, and toast. The gravy had an odd spice in it that was not enjoyable. Even my husband couldn't stomach them. Eggs were great, potatoes were good, and toast was a little burnt but good. My husband had the pancakes and thought they were too rubbery and too thin. I thought they tasted ok. Small portions and our total bill including two small orange juices was $57.99.

It's good because it's located out of the craziness of the pier area, but not far away at all. You can browse the souvenir shops on your way here. The menu is broad with lots of options for whatever your feel like.
