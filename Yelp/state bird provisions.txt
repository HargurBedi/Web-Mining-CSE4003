Amazing. This place has got the modern fusion with dim sum delivery model mastered and well-oiled. I loved every bite of what we had to eat here. 1) pancake is a must get, doesn't matter what variation. you've got to get some for the table or you're committing a cardinal sin 2) nori with tartare - really great starter, and one of the tastiest bites from the dinner 3) squash was amazing, tasted like sweet onion rings 4) never had as juicy and clean tasting octopus ever5) loved the bacon wrapped pastrami things with black sesame baos on the bottom (probably best thing I ate here aside from pancakes)AND AMAZING DESSERTS. can't go wrong with selections here, it's truly a wonderful experience.

I jumped on the chance to make reservations at State Bird Provisions after their re-opening and after a very stressful 15 minutes I was able to score a table for 2 on a Sunday! State Bird Provisions is just as cute and novel as everyone else says it is. I love the dim sum style of carts running through the restaurant and it makes it such a fun date spot. The tension over arguing over dishes is unmatched by any other. Stand-out dishes were the duck liver mousse (YOU NEED TO GET THIS), pork belly & pluot salad (I still don't know what pluots are really, but it's an incredible pairing), and of course the garlic bread with burrata (I could have just the burrata and be happy). They have some great flavors and definitely stray away from traditional Asian tastes. I will say a lot of their flavors were on the stronger, almost sour side which I personally don't enjoy as much, but I'm sure others would! I would definitely recommend checking out State Bird at least once- one of the more unique dining experiences in San Francisco for sure!

Had been looking forward to coming here for almost two years! The reservations are definitely difficult to get, needing to reserve two months in advance. I left with an okay experience but felt like it was extremely over hyped and slightly disappointing in that nothing wow-ed me and I wasn't even that full after a $120 meal. The restaurant has a dim-sum theme where servers come by serving tapas on carts but there is also a set menu to choose from. For three, we ordered four items off the main menu and a bunch of tapas that came around in carts. The first item we got were the oysters which tasted way too fishy. We got a few chip and dip items like the smoked trout dip with chips and the lamb tartar. The lamb tartar was really good!! I loved it but didn't really taste the lamb in it. We also tried the soup dumplings, which I'd skip next time. Nothing special there and pretty salty. I liked the tempura squash dish. We had to try the state bird (quail) and halibut from the menu. The state bird was fried quail and was very underwhelming. The items were mostly cheesy, spicy, and small. I'd recommend vegans to steer clear of this place because everything either had dairy or meat. As for service and ambiance, they were great. The servers were all very friendly and the ambiance was loud and lively.

Admittedly I didn't know much about State Bird Provisions prior to dining here- so I didn't have any expectations, but they left an impression and I'm eager for a return visit. Reservations were not made prior, so we had a little bit of a wait prior to their opening. We were luckily seated for dinner with a relatively minimal wait. A menu is offered for certain larger dishes, but most of the food comes around in carts or trays in smaller portions (a similar concept to dim sum). Each dish is described with their price displayed. Pro: you get to see the dish before you decide if you want it, and it comes in smaller portions. Con: In my experience, I'm usually hungry in the beginning and sometimes already full when the later dishes arrive that I would want to try. Also, you can get carried away choosing dishes while prices can quickly add up. We tried a variety of dishes. From the carts:Heirloom tomato saladDumpling in brothOysterPork bellyDuck confit Garlic bread with burrataCornbread with duck liverSpare ribsPotato chips with creme fraiche and roeMenu items: State Bird with provisionsOlive oil ice cream sandwich (dessert) Sweet corn panna cotta, figs (dessert)My favorites were: State Bird with provisions. Juicy and perfectly cooked bird. Half order was the right amount for two. Pork belly- crisp and fatty and paired well with the greens and fruit it's served with. And the garlic bread with burrata. Both of the desserts ordered were incredibly delightful. Duck confit, cornbread with duck liver, and spare ribs were personally my least favorite dishes, but still were worth trying. Service was excellent by the entire staff and overall the food was tasty and impressive. I will definitely be back.

If you can believe it (I mean, it is San Francisco...), I made reservations 2 months in advance for State Bird. Crazy! This restaurant is dimsum/tapas-like with modern New American dishes. Between the four of us, we ordered about 17-18 dishes and shared a bottle of wine. This restaurant is perfect for parties of four because the food divides pretty evenly like this. With two people, you might not be able to try as many things as we did!- The baked avocado with quinoa dishes was one of my favorites.- Of course they'd have Hog Island oysters! The horseradish and sauce overpowered the oysters though...- Perfectly silky steamed eggs with kimchi as garnish.- Love love love the poke with nori crackers.- Melt in your mouth yellowtail - delicious!- Not really a fan of the baked cherries- Ordered the beef tongue and lamb dishes off the menu - highly recommend!It's always fun dining with Phil's family because everyone loves food. :) The bottle of wine we ordered paired really well with our food. Yum! The total before tip was $285 for 4 people, so the total came out to be around $90 per person. The dinner at State Bird Provisions was very enjoyable, but I can see how people would think it's more of a one time experience. However, since they do change their menu, I would definitely come back again! But definitely for special occasions since the price is a little steep. ;) Cheers!

I first heard about State Bird Provisions back in 2014 when a friend told me Ryan Gosling was spotted here. Well, three years later - I finally made it! The dining experience here is unlike any other. New American provisions/tapas served dim sum style with toasts/pancakes, bigger items (commandables), and desserts you can order from the menu. We had a group of three which was the perfect amount of mouths to share a wide variety of provisions. We couldn't help but pick up most things that came by, as well as stare down staff who were holding the items we wanted hostage (yeah, I'm referring to you, burrata dude!). The worse is when they run out before making it to your table so you gotta wait for the next round, ugh. Some of my favorites from the night..Provisions: + garlic bread with burrata - SO GOOD+ smoked brokaw avocado, charred allium & wild rice - yes the $9 avocado is worth it!Toast & Pancakes:+ heirloom tomato-fiscalini cheddar whole-grain pancakesCommandables: + carrot 'mochi' with brown butter & pistachio dukkah - super interesting, recommend trying this if you have enough people to share since the portion is pretty large+ red trout with toasted hazelnut-mandarin-garum vinaigretteThere was also some stuff we were pretty indifferent about - didn't really care for the chawanmushi, elote cake, roasted fennel, and silken tofu to name a few. Oh, and the sweet corn panna cotta.. sounds very interesting but stay far, far away. The other dessert we tried, the olive oil 'ice cream' sandwich, was pretty good, though. Lots of talk about people on that new seefood diet nowadays, so what better place to start than at State Bird Provisions!

I'm a bit torn between a 4 and a 5 for this place because some of the food was hit or miss. Overall I liked the dim sum style service and the chance to try a lot of different things.Some of the items I didn't think I would like (octopus and olive oil ice cream) were fantastic. Other items that I thought would be amazing were just ok- ex: some dishes like the dumpling in broth were a bit off balance (too acidic).I also strongly recommend the state bird (duh) and Parmesan sourdough bread stuff (don't remember what it was called).Price wise it really wasn't too bad for a fancy place. We came with 4 people, got to try a lot of things, and ended up paying about $50 each.

I was super excited about going to State Bird. I made reservations six months in advance, forgot about it and before I knew it I received a reminder to confirm my reservation! We found parking right out front (very hard to do) so we walked past the long line and they sat us immediately when we told them we had a reservation.We sat down and within minutes waiters with dim sum carts summarized the food selections. I was very hungry so I ended up ordering almost everything + ordering $18 red trout off the menu. As me and my beautiful date laughed at each other's unfamiliarity with the cuisine, we realized that we were getting full and had to pace ourselves. I thoroughly wanted to just enjoy being at one of the most talked about restaurants in San Francisco.I'm happy to report I did enjoy the friendly waiters and overall positive vibes. The food was good too, but then here lies the problem. My date and I both felt the food was overhyped for the price. Perhaps it's our price consciousness, but the $18 red trout was miniscule, but most likely worth every penny within this culinary world. But for us, we saw the $180 bill, smiled and had a good time but agreed a night out at overly priced Morton's Steakhouse would have been more worth it. Perhaps we just wanted steak? Yes it may have been our mood. :) Great people and ambiance, good food, too expensive for what we received. Go here for the interesting plate presentations, friendly wait staff and unique food (like foi gras). Just be ready to pay for it!

My daughter K made reservations 6 weeks in advance for my birthday. The first seating is at 5:30 pm and there are 30 people in line without lined up outside when we arrived. Parking was easy on the street. When they opened the doors the ones with reservations are seated first. The menu has about 15 items not including dessert. The rest of the food items are dim sum style and are brought to your table by try or cart. We ordered the halibut ceviche and the carrot mochi off the menu which turned out to be the best and the worst dish of the night. Best dishes Halibut ceviche Smoked trout dipPork belly Steak tartar OctopusGood dishesOystersCod collarRoasted fennel Duck moose Penna Cotta granita dessertSmoked clam tofuAvocadoDishes to pass on:Carrot and Mochi Daikon friesShishito peppersIce tea with yuzu syrupThere were only two dim sum items that we did not try Garlic bread and a tomato and zucchini dish. Service was good. Prices are ok. $188 before tip. Enjoyable evening with my family.

Overpriced restaurant for dishes which does not present something really unique.Service was good though. It is a good place for groups, but do not expect something special about food. It is just a regular place...I guess people look at the rating and of course it attracts a lot, but this place does not worth of waiting in endless lines or waiting for reservations..Fried rice we ordered was 20$ and absolutely nothing special, chocolate roll cake was 12$ and again... nothing special..The only things i liked was anchovies toast and pancakes with tomatoes..they were the cheapest in the menu below 10$ and were tasty

My boyfriend and I decided to try a Michelin star restaurant during our trip to SF. We decided to come when it opened in hopes of scoring some seats. We came a few minutes too late (a few minutes after opening) and had just missed the first seating. The couple in front of us had the last open seats. We were able to get a table for 7pm and they informed us that they would text us if anything opened earlier. We ended up getting seated around 6:30.We had theSmoked Trout Dip - Very good! Our favorite of the night. So creamy and delicious. It's served with potato chips similar to Lays.Oysters - Just okay. A bit too salty.Grilled Octopus -Good. Legs were perfectly charred and crispy.Duck Liver Mousse - Not a fan... did not like that combination with almond biscuits. Both were good separate. I wish they served this with a different type of bread.Meatballs - Good. The sauce was tangy/sour. Different than other sauces I've had with meatballs.Shishito Peppers - Good. It was a great snack inbetween plates.Crispy Pork Belly - Unbearably salty. I would take a bite and drink some water to wash down the saltiness before being able to enjoy the bite. My boyfriend was surpised they served something that salty... it really tasted like it was soaked in fish sauce... and then doused in fish sauce while being cooked. We were both very disappointed. Most of the dishes we tried were brought out around the restaurant on a cart or tray. The duck liver mousse and pork belly we ordered through our waitress after seeing the great reviews. I was surprised that the ones we ordered were a miss...During our stay, they brought out a lot of the same dishes... probably because we were seated before the second seating at 7. I wish there was more variety. If we didn't choose something that was offered, it felt like awhile before something else came.The only dish that we really enjoyed was the smoked trout dip. The other dishes were good, but nothing we would rave about or order again if we came back.

When I travel solo, I like to try places that are tapa style. I know, I know, tapas are supposed to be shared. But I want to try all the dishes and tapas are just small enough that I can convince myself they were made for one.That being said, I decided one Sunday that I was going to come to State Bird Provisions. No reservations, just a deep hunger for good food. Arriving at 5:25 pm, I waited in a line as those with reservations were seated. The line for standbys was surprisingly short, and I was seated in the first round right at the kitchen counter.It is both a blessing and a curse to sit at the kitchen counter. A blessing, because you get to see all the delicious food being made. A curse, because then you really want to eat everything. The wait staff are all super busy bringing around the a la carte items and serving people, but keep a lovely, vibrant attitude throughout!Throughout my time there I tried the following dishes: the cod, smoked trout dip and chips, an oyster, the guinea hen dumpling, shishito peppers, grilled octopus, and beef tongue on poppy bun. I also stole a small bite of my immediate neighbor's sourdough and burrata (thanks Jess!), who was a lovely person to intermittently talk to during the meal. +1 for pleasant people-- between my next door seatmate and the staff, State Bird Provision has nice people in abundance!Now, onto the dishes. My favorite dish of the evening was the cod. If they come around with the blackened cod, take it. The tail is so deliciously charred that you bite into it and it tastes like a chip. Plus, the fish itself is delicious! When the chef offered it to me I said yes so fast and it was the best decision of the evening.Next favorites were the beef tongue (off the ordering menu) and the trout dip. Both were delicious! The beef tongue was also an option to get a half-order of (several items on the ordering menu are), which is always nice. The beef tongue was nice and tender and the poppy seed bun-- poppy seed buns are one of my new favorite things. The smoked trout dip is also delicious and the chips used to dip aren't too shabby themselves.Third is the grilled octopus, which in any other dinner ranking would be top of the pack! Super tender and yummy. The shishito peppers were also tasty, but the problem for me were they weren't spicy enough (but thank you to the wait staff for the free tasting!).At the bottom of the list for me was the oyster and guinea hen dumpling. The dumpling was a little lukewarm for me-- I feel like if it had just come out and was piping hot, I would have enjoyed it so much more. The oyster was just average and the garnish they put on subpar-- it's actually the only thing I tried that I would recommend skipping.I also got a lovely sauvignon blanc with my meal at a reasonable price. What I ate probably could have been shared by 1.5 people, but what can I say, I'm a fatty? The wait staff at least congratulated me on a job well done when I was finished haha.With lovely people and lovely food, I can't wait to come back! This time, with someone else. As much as I love solo travel, I would rather try even more dishes next time.

Think dim sum style, but modern American style food... Cool, right!? We have been wanting to try this place out for a couple of years now, so we were excited to come here with the whole family. Since we had a large party, I booked a reservation 60 days in advance. Reservations open up at midnight, and even though I booked right at 12:04am, I still didn't get the time I wanted! So if you want to reserve a large party on a weekend, you better be ready to submit your reservation request online. Because we had a large party, our menu was already set with 17 different courses from the night's menu. Normally if you come in with a smaller party, you can just order from their carts and trays that come around and pick items a la carte. I think this was a really awesome way to try out State Bird Provisions because we tried 17 items all for $68, whereas each item looked like it normally ranged from about $7-15 per plate. My favorites of the night were:- Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancake (I don't know what sauerkraut powder is...but it was amazing)- Cast Iron Quail Eggs with Smoky Date Puree and Pancetta (the puree though!!)- Pork Belly and Pluot Salad (the most tender pork belly I've ever had.. eat it with the quail egg dish!)- CA state bird with provisions (so crunchy and flavorful!) - Carrot mochi with brown butter (what IS carrot mochi..I have no idea but it was amazing) - Peanut Milk (it was not on the menu but we ordered as an extra item... tasted like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of Reese's Puffs!)The staff was great too. We had a blast and I hope to come back here soon. If you're looking to get into the Michelin scene, this is a nice first step. It's more casual and the price is more affordable compared to most Michelins in the area.

Pro tip - They offer half orders of some of their desserts! I love this option because I usually just want to taste the dessert and not eat a whole portion. We tried their black sesame macaron ice cream sandwich, which was pretty good but a bit sweet when compared to the olive oil sandwich I've had from them in the past. I loved all of the courses, like dumpling soup, miso black cod collar, black bean pork ribs, and beet salad. My lemon rose soda was amazing! There was a particularly interesting trout with pea puree that was meant as a dip, which they served with potato chips. Is there anything they can't do right? Well, their sourdough bread and burrata was a bit salty and heavy. Deep fried sourdough bread, which sounds amazing, is actually a bit too hard, plus it was seasoned with a mix that reminded me of Johnny Garlic's seasoning mix. We just did one add on dish, since we like ordering from the dim sum selection. The yuba noodles we ordered were so delicious and light. We were also lucky enough to be seated at the counter, so it was fun to see them prepare the food and get a sneak peek at what would be offered to us.

Upscale trendy tapas/dimsum styled restaurant hidden on Fillmore St. - It's not just an ordinary meal but a thrilling experience of spontaneously deciding whether to opt for food presented to you by the waiters in the span of a few seconds! It really keeps you on your toes throughout the meal (kidding... I'm exaggerating but it's still a cool concept that makes my meal a little more exciting)Onto the food: ALL the dishes were so unique and impressive. You can tell by the look, taste, and name of the dish itself that there was a lot of thought and creativity put into each item. The tapas don't seem mass made and are individually crafted in small batches (by the trays)I'd have to say my favorites were (if I had to narrow it down to a few):- CA state bird- pork belly- sauerkraut ricotta pancake- trout dip (with avocado and tomato sauce)- peanut milk!!- ice cream sandwichI also learned as I was enjoying my meal that this restaurant has one Michelin star since 2016 and requires a 2-month lead time to make reservations. So get on Opentable or give them a call! Reservations are apparently a hot commodity!

It is usually dangerous to go to a restaurant that is super hyped up as your expectations would be set at a much higher bar than what you would experience. State Bird Provisions lived up to the hype but not much more. The food and service were well thought and good, but there was nothing overly spectacular or stunningly memorable. But it was still very good, just over-hyped that it did not blow me away.Most dishes are served dim sum style where servers come by with different plates at different price points and you pick what your heart and stomach desire. There are some staples on the menu that are ordered with any server, no loyalty to any particular person which I found refreshing.Best dishes: "World Peace" peanut milk - smooth and creamy peanut milk with a splash of simple syrup. One shot is not enough, I can take a whole bottle!Pate - very light and smooth. Eat it like frosting on a corn cupcake.State Bird Quail - so crispy and tasty.Mint Chocolate Ice cream Macaron Sandwiches - perfectly chewy macaron and silky ice cream.Honorable mentions:Chawanmushi - delicate and soft textureGarlic fried bread and burrata - you know, because burrataGreen garlic noodles - like bean curd skin made into noodles, interesting and unique flavorOyster - very freshPork belly - lots of fish sauce but flavors worked well togetherThe Forgettables: Beets - could have gotten the same at Trader Joe'sChips and dip - regular ole potato chips and smoked troutDumpling - flat in flavor and thick dumpling skinCroque Madame - this did not resemble a croque madame by any means. Not cheesy and the ham was duck?Pastrami beef tongue on poppyseed pancakes - those pancakes floppedBlueberry Bao - like a giant beard papaDefinitely a good experience and the restaurant might be the least stuffy of all the Michelin stars in the area. Great to try at least once and would definitely like to try more dishes as they change constantly.

I'm finally here!I have been hearing how hard it was to make reservation at State bird and finally we were able to make a reservation for big group (7 of us) last week. Food was good, but I'm not super impressed.When you have a big group, dinner menu is set - that's one of the reason why i was not so impressed with some dishes. There were a total of 17 dishes, including dessert - every plate was meant to share. I had to say that was a lot of food, and we were all so full. There were a few dishes that stood out from the rest:1. halibut tartare with nori chip - i love the nori chip!2. duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - i can finish the whole plate by myself...3. trout with toasted hazelnut-mandarin-garum vinaigrette - the trout was cooked perfectly!I am not saying the rest of the dishes are not good, but some were not my cup of tea. If I have to go back next time, I would rather do a small group so I can pick what I like to order. Overall, it was a pretty good experience. Hopefully I will get to try the uni next time when I'm back~

Last minute plans with friends. He said, "don't worry about the reservations, we don't need it!" Since he too is a restaurant owner, and I guess it pays, because their RSVP is months out. Interesting ambiance. We spoke about the decor of the place, since I was around developers. Place has its own characters. Well, you come here for the food since it's Michelin Rated?This place reminded me of dim-sum style dining. They roll around in carts. The Staff, were all great! Knowledgeable about the food and always smiling. Even when we left, the entire kitchen smiled and greeted us goodnight. I forgot the name of the dishes, since we let our friend order. The octopus tentacles was delicious, very tender and cooked perfectly. "The Bird" was tasty, but nothing to really rave about. The almond pate, was delicious as well. The pork belly, has two very small pieces and was tender as it should be. It reminded of Filipino "lechon kawali" which I prefer over this. Heirloom tomatoes were good and the cantaloupe. The trout-dip was good. Sauce overwhelmed the trout, so some didn't taste it. He dry beef, it was good. It is exactly what it is, dry on the outside with a bit of pink in the middle, but don't mistake it for a beef jerky. Over all, fun place to eat, great execution on the food. The only thing that failed to me was the dumpling with soup. A bit too salty and didn't have much flavor but salt, AND, I bit into a bone in the dumpling. The wine selection here is pretty good. After a bottle of Cabernet, that didn't truly satisfy us, our server was kind enough to bring us another bottle from next door, which is their sister restaurant. We wanted a full body cab. The Experience was great with the fellas talking food and business. But a date with another foodie would be great here. BRB#SOLitFood

Updated review
After all the years, I'm still a huge fan of State bird Provisions and it's concept. I recently visited this place with some friends and it's nice to see it hasn't skipped a beat. The service is still on point, and the different dishes are spot on. It was nice to see some of the old standards that I enjoy so much (more on that later) alongside some new welcomed additions to the menu. Becacuse there are so many different items on the menu and all I did was say yes, it might be easier to list all the items and star the unmissable recommendations. Cool?- hog island oyster, kohlrabi kraut & sesame* guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth- pork belly & citrus salad* smoked trout-english pea 'chip & dip'* sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes* yeasted poppyseed beef tongue pastrami pancakes* 'croque madame' duck ham & fiscalini cheddar whole-grain pancakes* CA state bird with provisions* red trout with toasted hazelnut-mandarin-garum vinaigrette* spring lamb 'piccata' with asparagus, ramps & kimchi brown butter* duck confit & nameko mushroom 'fried rice' a la planchaWhole lotta stars, eh? :) Point being, you can't miss here! Wait in line, book out a reservation, just do what you can to get in the door and you'll be wowed.

Everything is absolutely delicious here! I tried numerous things off of the menu and off the carts coming around and everything was outstanding. Tried numerous Provisions and they were all extremely good. My favorites were the spanish octopus, trout roe "chips and dip," lap cheong sausage and the ribs. The ribs!!! They are amazing. Get them. Tried the heirloom tomato and whole-grain pancakes as well as the summer squash and Meyer lemon goat cheese toast. Both were incredible and I really can't decide which I liked more. Tried the CA State Bird, Carrot Mochi, and 'Fried Rice & Beans' commandables. They were all fantastic. Every bite was exploding with flavor. I got to try three of the desserts: the sweet corn panna cotta, the chocolate roll cake, and the olive oil ice cream sandwich. The best (by far) was the ice cream sandwich! You need to get this. This place is outstanding and I can't wait to come back. We ended up spending about $50 a person which, for a meal of this caliber, I would do that over and over again.

We left in a food coma from deliciousness! There is a standing menu, and then the servers bring around a myriad of small plates dim sum style. - We ordered the fried rice with duck confit off the standing menu. Eat bite was rich and wonderfully complex. I could've been satisfied with that alone.- For the small bites we had the pork ribs, Asian sausage, dumpling (with the most flavorful broth), burrata with garlic bread, chips with salmon/avocado dip, and pork belly with citrus.- Each dish was wonderfully crafted, the servers were polite, and I long to go back and have another perfect meal.

I just came to State Bird with a group of eight and it was a great dining experience! I made a reservation for the Alcove Table almost two months in advance so that is definitely the move if you have a large party. When you reserve for a group this large, they send you a google form where you can write out any dietary restrictions for the group which we all really appreciated. Also different was the serving style. State Bird is known for their dim sum style of serving which is so fun and very unique. Reserving the "Alcove Table" means there is a set menu of essentially everything the restaurant has to offer. They make sure there is more than enough for everyone and for my gluten and dairy friend, they made sure there were substitutions specific for her each time there was an issue. Some standouts for me were the duck liver with cornbread biscuits, the State Bird (which was unbelievable), the trout entree as well as the trout avocado chip and dip. While some dishes shined more than others, I enjoyed all of them and there weren't any that left a bad taste in my mouth...no pun intendedBooking the alcove table took a lot of the stress out of the dim sum experience where the bill can get expensive really fast and it's hard to know what you want when lots of things are showing up randomly at the table. I would definitely recommend booking this table if you want to come for a group, just plan ahead!The table for 8 had a $500 food and drink minimum which is pretty reasonable especially if you don't order wine. They price everything out for you in advance so you don't have to think about anything. It was an exceptional experience and I'm looking forward to coming back!

Maybe it was overhyped and my expectations were too high but I felt really meh about State Bird. My party got quite a few dishes off the menu and almost everything that came by on the carts. Nothing stood out to me as amazing (maybe because the night prior we dined at Liholiho) and some of the items were just plain disappointing.I found the dim sum style to be distracting and almost stressful. The cart would come by every few minutes and interrupt our conversation. We would then have to make a group decision whether we wanted the item being offered or not. I've been to dim sum before and don't remember feeling negatively about the cart service. I probably wouldn't return.

I'm sure I won't be saying anything new about State Bird Provisions that hasn't been already said. Service & atmosphere: typical upscale hipster vibe with friendly and informative wait staff. Food was brought around in a steady pace with our ordered food arriving quickly. Food: I can't even remember everything that my party of 5 ordered. We got multiple toasts and as many dim sum as my parents would let me order. The standouts for my group was the fried state bird, pozole, and the sea urchin toast, though pretty much everything was delicious. Words of caution that you probably already know: it took me forever to come here because of how quick their reservations fill up. Definitely set an alarm for 60 days ahead of when you're looking to come in and be prepared to be flexible in your times. Second, I mean you know what you're getting into I'm sure. But if my parents weren't footing the bill, I wouldn't have been able to afford as many dishes as I would make me even close to full. Altogether, as long as someone else pays, I'd love to come back and try the remaining plates we didn't devour.

Although we were unable to get reservations, we got there early and waited in line so that when they opened, after they seated the reserved tables, many if not all of the people in line got seated. We sat at the chef's counter and so got to see all the cooking. I'd recommend sitting there if you can.The service here was very good even though you don't get a dedicated server. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. They worked very well with my allergies, which can be difficult with that many servers. Very good communication between wait staff and kitchen as well as among wait staff. The cooks seem to work slowly. We noticed this while waiting in line and watching them prep as well as when we were waiting for our "commandables" (entrees you order rather than items served dim sum style) to arrive.We gave the food mixed reviews. The dim sum style (actually these dishes reminded me more of passed appetizers than dim sum, which seems like it would be more dumpling based) dishes we tried were:Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - I liked this one, but my dining companion did not care for the broth. The dumpling was more the size of a small ravioli.Delicata squash tempura with pepitas, black sesame, and soy - we both really liked this. The tempura wasn't greasy and you could taste the squash. I didn't really love the sauce it was on--it was a little pasty, but it didn't take away from the dish too much.Pork belly and pluot salad - I did not taste this as my allergies prevented it. My companion found this dish absolutely disgusting. They do not say that it is doused with fish sauce, but it was, so if you don't like fish sauce (or don't like a lot of it) you will not enjoy this. It left a bad taste in his mouth for the rest of the meal.Potato porridge with ramen egg, pickled nori, and quinoa furikake - this was pretty tasty with the quinoa being the best thing all night.Spanish octopus with creamy butterbeans, green olive and kosho - I enjoyed this. I've had better octopus, but it wasn't overly chewy like some places cook it. I liked the butterbeans best and they were a good pair with the octopus.Ham-fiscalini cheddar whole grain pancakes - not at all what I was expecting. Less like a pancake because it was fried, very salty, fiscalini a little dry. I didn't hate this dish, but it wasn't my favorite.State bird with provisions - we ordered a half serving of this, but they brought us a whole serving--not a huge deal and it may be that it was just too loud to hear us when we ordered. This dish was not what I was expecting. My dining partner said the breadcrumbs seemed like the Progresso Italian seasoned ones, and he was not impressed with the fried bird at all. He hated the provisions, which turned out to be just onions and parmesan. I liked the onions especially when eaten in the same bite with the quail, but I had a more generous idea of what "provisions" meant and was expecting some interesting sides with it. Thirty dollars for one fried quail and some onions was a little disappointing.Overall, I wanted to like this place more than I did. I have been a little surprised to find out in some other Yelp reviews that they have a Michelin star. I feel like we might have been more critical and disappointed had we known that going in. The good surprise is that Michelin would give a star to a more casual place, which I think they should do more often. But the other surprise is that the food doesn't consistently have great balance of flavors the way I would expect.I might recommend it to someone who wants a little different experience when dining, but I can't say I'd recommend it to someone wanting consistently excellent food.

A stunningly innovative, impeccably executed, largely, broadly American menu, served from carts, dim sum style. To paraphrase Chef Guy Fieri, there is nothing I do not love about this.OK, there was one thing we did not absolutely love: the buckwheat-and-beef-tongue pancakes. But even they were done and presented well. And everything else knocked it out of the park. A guinea hen dumpling in its sublimely aromatic broth. Perfectly prepared and portioned polenta, elevated beyond all reason by a house-made Sun Gold tomato jam. (We all ordered a second round.) The best octopus we've had outside of Italy. Fresh, succulent oysters dressed with...sauerkraut? Yes, sauerkraut. Amazing. Delicious.The restaurant's namesake is fried quail. It is what many if not most fried chicken dishes aspire to become. The place could do pretty good business just selling its fried quail. Out of a hole-in-the-wall window. Or a food truck.The desserts were equally impressive. The zucchini-walnut cake was one of the best I'd ever had. It would have been even more impressive if we hadn't also ordered the ice cream sandwich. House-made coconut ice cream, sandwiched between chocolate French macaron layers. Impossible to do justice in mere words.The servers were well-coordinated, well-informed about the dishes, and uniformly professional, patient, and helpful. The vibe is like a good-sized dim sum hall with a sushi-bar-like counter near the front. Even the music was perfect -- old-school soul and funk, at a perceptible but not distracting volume.When she heard we were dining here, a friend who runs a food truck in San Diego said, "bring all your money, and eat everything." Four of us ate everything we wanted, including drinks and dessert, for about $80 per person. Yes, it's a splurge. And we all agreed we had spent more for far less elsewhere.When you and your dining companions start talking about wanting to come back to a restaurant one-third of the way through a first meal there, you know you're eating someplace special. If the food weren't spectacular, it would just be an interesting gimmick. Instead, State Bird Provisions is a special night out, if you love great food presented in ways that can get you to look at that food anew.

Take dim sum and mix it with modern American food and you have State Bird Provisions. Came here with four people and we tried everything. For starters, we had the pork belly, duck liver, steak tartare poke, and the smoked trout chip & dip. For dinner (yes we were still hungry) we had the halibut, gulf shrimp, and fried rice with miso-chili. Everything was awesome and I highly recommend this place. The vibe is cool and the service is friendly. State Bird Provisions is one of those places that if you don't have a 5 star experience then there is something wrong.Five Stars for the food, service, and vibe!

I am a fan of State Bird Provisions and love the idea of "dim-sum," but if you are seated in the back, it's so hard to get the delicious dishes. We came in at 9:30PM on a Saturday and it was packed, we were 5 starving girls who made reservations. We were seated pretty quickly and it was very cozy in the back corner. We changed our reservations 3 times, but each time State Bird was so accommodating. We were so hungry, but the dishes take time to rotate around the restaurant, especially because the open kitchen is in the front, therefore the food rotates from the front to the back. We grew impatient waiting, so decided to order off the menu. We must have been hungry because we ate 16 dishes by the end of the night and 3 bottles of the Rose. Everything was really good and their food collaboration are always so unique and goes very well together. Our favorite was the State Bird, pork belly, ribs, sausages, gulf shrimp, tartare and the oysters. The staff are all really friendly, hard-working and offer the best service. Everyone is willing to take your order, help you choose dishes and drinks and explain the dishes, give you new plates and utensils. State Bird really has great service!

My 300th review! And what a restaurant to review. I think I've found a few fave restaurant in sfI'm obsessed with tapas style spots so this is pure heaven. Great location, crazy variety of food, and get full off little noms! My only rec is to GET THERE EARLY! Like 45 mins before the restaurant opens if you don't have reseys

Obtaining a reservation for the exact date and time you want seems nearly impossible. For a reservation here it's more about planning your entire day/trip around it. Luckily they save a few tables strictly for walk-ins which is what we did, arriving about half an hour prior to opening to a small line already growing outside the restaurant.For the most part I'd say we enjoyed the whole food cart/dim sum style experience here. It allowed us to try many dishes and revisit ones we really enjoyed. It can get expensive quick, however, especially if you want to try everything. I actually found saying 'no' to dishes as they passed quite difficult. It feels so much easier to say no at a dim sum restaurant because the servers often seem indifferent about their jobs, but here they come by with their tray or cart and explain the dishes in detail with much more enthusiasm, comparably. I almost felt bad saying 'no' in part because it's a progressive and trendy restaurant and you almost feel like you would be judged for passing on any certain dish. These thoughts were completely unsubstantiated, however.Of the many dishes that were passing by our table that we partook in, the most memorable to me were the steak tartare poke, poppyseed buckwheat beef tongue pastrami pancakes, pork belly & pluots, and the smoked trout-english pea 'chip & dip.' We also had a full order of the CA state bird with provisions (naturally) and the red trout. I preferred the trout out these two 'Commandables.' Dessert was amazing and an excellent finish to our meal. Couldn't get enough of the strawberry granita with anise seed fig leaf panna cotta and nectarines.Very good meal overall. Not sure if it fully lived up to the hype for us (which, admittedly, had been built up for quite some), but glad we got to experience it.

Prelim ReviewOne of the best restaurants in San Francisco that I have ever been to. Any reviewer that gives this restaurant anything less than a 5 star review is contrarian to the level of being unreasonable or finding some silly piece of minutia to critique while ignoring the overall experience of this restaurant. Do yourself a favor and try every single dish on the menu and eat it all family style. Expertly crafted food using the finest ingredients, creative/unique flavor and texture combinations, incredibly polite and attentive service, great modern but casual ambiance, "relatively" affordable pricing, and great drink selection. Very clean restrooms. Overall (surprisingly) better than its sister-restaurant "The Progress." Difficult to get reservations but absolutely worth it when you nab one.

It's not often a place so hyped is actually as good as people say but hot damn does this place live up to every expectation I've ever been told. Reservations need to be made well in advance but they do leave a fair share of seats for walk-ins. The only caveat is that you need to be lined up by 4:30/4:45 to get a spot. As far as the food goes you can't really go wrong- if you're not familiar with the concept they serve the majority of their food dim sum style. Wait staff walks around with trays of dishes and you select what you want. There are a few things you can order as well. The only problem with this method is you don't know what's going to come out- as soon as you're stuffed you'll see a new amazing dish come out of the kitchen. You must have the dumplings, the fired sourdough with burrata and the hedgehog toast. I also really enjoyed the beef tartare and pork belly salad. It's also not terribly expensive- our food (we had 9 or 10 dishes) was only about $65.

I travel to San Francisco about once a year, and I finally got a chance to try State Bird Provisions after being aware of it for more than a year. I have to say that I really like every aspect of it - the dining concept, the food and the service. It deserves all the accolades it gets.For my visit, I had:Hog island oysters withpickled daikon and chili oil - good starterSmoked duck with vinaigrette - yumFried chicken with kimchi custard - it was okSpanish octopus with vinaigrette - deliciousDuck confit and wagon wheel cheese croquette - deliciousOx tail with peanut pozole - it was okchai tea ice cream sandwich - deliciousblood orange granita with olive oil gelee - did not like thisAlthough I did not absolutely love every dish I ordered, what I do love here is the "dim sum" concept of ordering - the servers bring out little dishes with a little price tag on the tray, and you get to see whether it looks good to you or not. Once you pick something, the server marks it on your sheet. There is also the option of ordering from the menu as well, but the dim sum style is just way more fun, and you also get to try dishes that are not on the menu. I was excited to know when ordering desserts that half-orders are accepted - so being the greedy hungry person that I am, I ordered two half-order desserts - the chai tea ice cream sandwich and the granita. When I was asked about how dessert was, I informed my server that I did not love the granita (and it was not even half finished). He kindly took that off the bill without any intervention on my part, and I was very impressed with the service.Needless to say, I will be visitng SBP again for my next SF visit. Reservations are a must because the place does get packed. As for myself, I managed to do a walk-in for just one person at around 6pm and sat at the chef's counter without having to wait.

Another I-gen over hyped foodie destination with a horrible theme .. not worth the wait to get in and not worth the price .. I went here for my birthday and was extremely disappointed .. think bad Gary Danko wanna be ala dim sum cart style with the prices labeled on each cart .. where do I even begin with this one ?? Such misappropriation of a culture .. I can't even think of an analogy because it's such a bad idea and such a turn off to me Gross . Like the ice cold $15 spoon of duck fat they try and sell you ..

State Bird Provisions is absolutely delicious and I cannot begin to explain how much I love this restaurant. Of course, I was not able to make reservations after trying for a long time (even at midnight when another day's reservations open!). So we decided to come and just wait. We arrived at around 4pm and there was already a line, which got significantly longer as time went on. It was kind of cool to go early because the line passes a window into their kitchen, and you can actually watch some of the chefs preparing the dishes. While we were in line, they even gave out some delicious hot chocolate, which was a nice gesture!First, they took in people with reservations, and then they start letting the line in to put in times people wanted to eat. After being in line for so long, we decided to eat right away of course. Basically, the servers bring around carts or trays with the dishes on them, with a placard stating the dish and price. Sometimes they also run out of dishes before it gets to your table but they're really diligent about coming back to your table if they know you want it, or you can just tell your server as well. First, we ordered the half CA State Bird and the Red Trout, which are more like entrees. And then the servers start coming to tables with the trays/carts. Here's what we thought about some of the food:+CA STATE BIRD: We had two people and decided to get the smaller portion of both entrees to be able to try a lot of dishes. This was also really delicious! It went so well with the shaved parmesan too. Would actually definitely recommend still, even if you want to try lots of smaller dishes.+RED TROUT: Came with some fruit and was super light and refreshing!+DUCK LIVER MOUSSE: They come with these slightly sweet almond biscuits and are so tasty with the salty duck liver mousse. The texture is so creamy!+PORK BELLY: Ours came with some citrus slices that were just amazing with the fatty pork belly! Would definitely get this again!+STEAK TARTARE: I've never had it in this preparation with the slightly Asian flair but I loved this! It also came with nori chips and was absolutely perfect!+SMOKED TROUT DIP: Just get it! It's delicious and there's quite a lot of it, which is fantastic.+OCTOPUS: This is probably the softest octopus I've ever had and the whole dish just goes so well together!-GUINEA HEN DUMPLING: The broth was delicious and the dumpling was good, but paled in comparison of the other dishes.-HOG ISLAND OYSTER: This I probably could've done without, but then again I'm more of a fan of just lemon or mignonette on my oysters. It does have sauerkraut which I thought overpowered it a little.One of the aspects that I love so much about State Bird is that you can try so many different dishes (wish we could've tried them all!). It was also one of the more affordable Michelin star restaurants I've been to. All in all, this was an amazing experience and well worth the wait, and the food itself is phenomenal.

I visited here as it was recommended as a "must try" place in SFO. Service was great, ambience was great, wait time was reasonable. Food was above average. I was actually disappointed as the food was not described delicious and memorable, moreso just... tasty. That may be due to my party of 4 sitting at the opposite side of the kitchen.To explain to those who have yet, this place serves tapas in a dim sum twist. A server will stop by your table with a specific type of tapa labeled with a price. If you want it, you take it and they stamp it on a card that is considered your check. If you don't want it, the server moves onto the next table and does the same thing. After observing, I noticed that our side of the room did not get much attention from the servers so we missed out on a lot of awesome tapas. As we finished our meal, paid a hefty bill, and walked out.. we noticed multiple tapas that we all would have thoroughly enjoyed being presented to the tables sitting closer to the kitchen. I honestly think my experience and my opinion would be dramatically different if our party had the opportunity to try the other tapas that some tables got the chance to try. Unfortunately, that was not the case which is why this place gets a 3.5/5. I will only come back if I get to sit near the kitchen.Regarding the food, my party only got 4-5 tapas. All being above average good, except for the raw oysters. I just didn't like their twist to it - all my friends agreed as well.

This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. It usually has a long wait on weekends, so what I like to do is show up ~30 minutes before it opens and wait in line, and then either get seated immediately once it opens, or get a table for later in the evening, and go to a bar for a drink or go to the theater nearby.In terms of the restaurant itself, it's small plates, some of which are ordered from a menu, and some of which are wheeled around on carts a la dimsum. Some of the dishes I really enjoyed:- Duck liver mousse with madelines: amazing flavours and very interesting combination- Garlic bread with burrata: really, really good- Sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancakes (they're known for their pancakes so make sure to try one if not this one!)- state bird with provisions (their signature!)- world peace peanut muscovado milk It usually costs me $75-100pp excluding drinks depending on how much we order, which I think is a pretty good deal given the quality of food.

My friends and I came here on a week day. Luckily we made reservations because there were people waiting outside. The place is located right by Japantown and parking is all streets. Service is great, food is great,but price is a little bit on the expensive end. The cool thing about this place is that there's food going around each tables instead of ordering directly through the waiter/waitress. In a way, it's like dim sum and they go around in carts and you pick what you want. I think my friends and I tried almost everything on the menu. There's so many good things that you want to try and we just had to try them all. The waiters are all very friendly and always checked up on us. They filled our water cups every so often. Definitely will come back again to try some other stuff next time!

Come 10 minutes before close to get a seat, and often a menu of the items on the cart. The menu varies a little each weekday, so mix up your nights if you want to capture the full breadth of the offerings. Dumpling in aromatic broth is great. Octopus is good. Melons with cucumbers also good. Skip the garlic bread since the only flavor is in the salt and pepper.

Divinity on a plate - or many plates as we had all the dishes! Not to be missed is the pork belly, every iteration ever had here has been exceptional. While I suggest ordering off the menu for standout dishes the true play and wit emerges from the small plates passed. Artistry meets flavorful delight in a play on flavors ever so nuanced it leaves you on the verge of a food orgasm. The chef truly understands what each flavor and texture is doing on the plate and in the bite!

After many cancelled reservations we finally made it to dinner. I am sad to report my expectations might have been too high.Lemme start off by saying I was really focused on enjoying my meal and the company so I wasn't focused on the fancy names of everything, but here is my take on the menu...Dim Sun Cart Highlights: Chip and Dip, Oysters were yummy but lacked spice (ask for hot sauce), the Almond Muffin thing was great, the Savory Dumpling- delish!Skip: the Beef Tartar and the Octopus. Both were just okay. Main Dish Highlights: Trout, Pastrami Pancake=YUM, Garlic Noodles were fabulous.Skip: Fried Rice was good but not special.Lessons learned: If I return I would order more of the pancake style food! Dessert: Ice Cream Sandwich was delicious! Order it! Sidebar: wine and beer only not a stellar variety but a solid selection.

Such a fun experience. Very much like Dimsum but with a twist and minus the ladies yelling while pushing carts (an old school long lived experience in itself at other dimsum restaurants) QUAIL.

The dim style food options and portions is exactly what I've been seeking in a restaurant for the longest time (that isn't dim sum). State Bird pulls it off pretty well.Definitely plan ahead and get a reservation. I'm no stranger to waiting in long lines for food, but they have a reservation system. Just need to keep on an eye on availability and snag one when you see it.We had one at the first seating so we just skied right in, gave our name, and sat awaiting the deliciousness to come. Soon thereafter the carts and trays came around. It was hard not to say yes to almost everything because it all sounded and looked so delicious. After several "yes, please" to dishes in a row, we realized we had to slow down to pace ourselves. Everything will come around again eventually so don't worry about being selective during the first go.Absolutely order the State Bird with Provisions off the standard menu, and save room for dessert. The cake we ordered wasn't mind blowing but with an in-house pastry chef it's worth a shot.

My first One Star Michelin restaurant experience!The hype among all of my friends is real and that this place is really as good as people say it is. I went here with my family (party of four), but was a rookie and did not read the reviews in advance to wait in line 1.5 hours ahead of time, not 0.5 hours ahead of time. Silly me and it turns out we waited about an additional three hours ahead of time. I did not read any of the reviews here that stated, but we were quoted a 9:30 PM eating time (oy, 4 hours after they open?!), but got a text message saying that they had a table ready for us at 8:30 (whew, one hour saved!) and we rushed back to Fillmore St in eager anticipation for the New American/Tapas/Dim Sum style restaurant. FOOD: With so many pictures posted on Yelp, here were the items. Hog Island Oyster, Kohlrabi Kraut + Sesame Root Vegetable Spring Roll with Whipped AvocadoPersimmon with Kinako + Black Sesame Curry Roasted Cauliflower with Smoked Date Puree and PistachioPork Belly and Citrus SaladPork Ribs with Black Bean Sauce and Black Garlic Garlic Bread with Burrata Smoked Trout Avocado Chip and DipSteak Tartare PokeOlio Nuovo 2016 with Poached Egg + Josey Baker ToastYeasted Poppyseed Beef Tongue Pastrami Pancake CA State Bird with ProvisionsHuckleberry GranitaKumquat-Vanilla Bean CakeFamily favorites included: Pork Belly and Citrus Salad, Smoked Trout Avocado Chip and Dip, Steak Tartare Poke, Olio Nuovo 2016 with Poached Egg + Josey Baker Toast, Yeasted Poppyseed Beef Tongue Pastrami Pancake, CA State Bird with Provisions, the Granita, and the Kumquat-Vanilla Bean Cake. Each of these dishes had that amazing freshness to it and was something unique to it. The texture, the simplicity of some of the dishes, and some of the complexity of some of the dishes, brought together a full experience from start to finish. I cannot say I really had anything I disliked on the menu, but I did have dishes I liked more than others. SERVICE: Without a doubt, amazing. I found the place to be so attentive by all the of wait staff and each dish was explained well. The carts are pushed around (dim sum style) with the price tag listed next to the dish. There is a rotation for the evening (you can see the provisions menu online), but even with a party of four, you can only eat so much before you realize you still have dessert to go. The waitstaff is easily reached and if you want to order something you have not seen come around, you can ask and then it can be brought to you.Definitely not pretentious, locally sourced produce and meat, and pretty good on the wallet (with all of that above, it was $220 total, so roughly $55pp for this kind of meal and we were stuffed!). I cannot wait to come back to State Bird Provisions again in another season to see what else Stuart and Nicole can whip up with their culinary genius! My only tip is to make the reservation in advanced. Yes, I tried before, but alas, failed. If you do want to wait in line, get there at 4:00 PM or else it's not really worth it since you miss the first round of open seating. You can show up later in the evening at 9:00 PM or later to see if an opening is available at that point.

Went to State Bird a little while back with 7 girlfriends and had an awesome experience! My friend made a reservation for the Alcove Table ($500 food and drink minimum) about 2 months in advance and was sent a Google Doc to fill out any dietary restrictions our group might have had. Come the night of our meal, they did a great job accommodating our gluten/dairy-free friend, making sure she had enough food and really taking the time to tell her what she could and could not eat.Reserving the Alcove Table meant not having to make many decisions, which made the dining experience even better. We didn't have to worry about what we would want to order and how pricey it might be - since it is dim sum style - but instead had a set menu with basically anything and everything State Bird offered, or so it seemed!Great ambiance, very fun and modern, with good music playing. I'm already excited to come back!

It's Hip! It's Cool! It's...STATE BIRD! I've been reluctant to try State Bird since I'm not the most patient when it comes to lines, or making reservations months in advance. However, I bit the bullet one day and waited in line. If you aren't interested in making a reservation, you can drop by State Bird RIGHT when it opens at 5:30pm. I recommend getting there by 5:15pm, since the line starts forming before then. After waiting in line (approximately 20 min for me), you can put your party's name down for a reservation that evening. Got there at 5:15pm, was seated at 7:15pm. There is plenty to do in the Japantown/Fillmore area, so the wait actually went by quickly. Now to the good stuff. State bird offers a tapas/dumpling style of delivery. Primarily small plates that are danced around your seats to catch your interest. It's a fun way to dine I must say! Also unique to a restaurant that isn't serving dim sum! The moment you sit down, you'll have delectable nibblets showcased for you. My recommendations include: beef tar tar, grilled octopus, chips with house dip (trust me it's unique), duck liver mousse, and the sesame ice cream sandwiches to finish. Bottom Line: Delicious plates are worth the wait.

Let me start by saying that expectations were very high. Almost impossible to get a reservation, many people line up since 4pm and wait until they open at 5:30PM to try to get a spot by the bar. We tried it once and didn't get a table... Still we were not to give up so finally were able to make a reservation 2 months in advance.2 months passed and I couldn't wait to try all the yummy food that everyone raved about. We were provided a table at the end of the restaurant (not great, I suggest you get one near the bar otherwise you never get first pick at the food).Our server was super friendly and made sure to ask all the ingredients we couldn't eat so she would marked them in the menu and provide me an option to eat those dishes without those. As you probably already know, this is a tapas-kind of restaurant. They were calling it DimSum but I'll stick with the tapas definition :)We had a bunch of dishes but none of them was particularly memorable apart from the bone marrow and the ravioli. The quail (their signature dish) was also good but the portion was so small that I wasn't able to really enjoy it.All in all the food is good, but for the price and all the trouble you go through to get a table I I'm afraid I won't be going for a second visit.

I've been wanting to come to state Bird and provisions for a while now. Finally made it and was not disappointed. Everything was good, most dishes were great. Inventive unique flavors. The staff is very friendly and fun. The style is new American small plates. Some dishes you can order off a menu. Others come around on carts, dim sum style. It's a lot of fun. Also means you can eat soon after sitting down. This is a must visit place. Can be tricky getting a reservation so plan early. But very worth it.

Came here over the weekend after making a reservation over a month in advance. They take reservations up to 60 days in advance, but fortunately they had a cancellation and could accommodate our group of 7.I recognize that the menu is always changing, but perhaps it was just a bit off this go-round. I liked the hipster ambiance and it certainly was deserving of their loving reputation of being "hipster dim sum". Everyone was super friendly and super chill. This isn't one of those fine-dining establishments where you're afraid to speak above a whisper, which was fantastic for our group.The meal is family style and for the most part, you can get your own bite as it comes to the table. Some bites were good, some were way too salty...unfortunately, I didn't think any were great.Some "good" bites were:- Garlic bread with burrata (which oddly enough was hard enough to leave a cut on the roof of my mouth, but chewy enough to still make me classify this as a good bite..lol)- Duck Liver mouse with almond biscuit - YUM! I wish the almond biscuits were bigger than the size of a nickel..- Goat cheese toast - cute little fluffy piece of toast that was smothered in goat cheese..- State Bird QUAIL..this was REALLY good. Like a mini-fried chicken..- Carrot Mochi - this was my most favorite dish of the night. How do they get the mochi texture SO PERFECT..and SOOO much like carrot??Some bites that were too salty:- The a la carte dumplings that you could order :(- Roasted fennel with peanut crunch - the crunch made it feel like I was eating sand. Overall, it was good! I think my expectations were just too high and I ended up leaving a bit disappointed. However, if you're looking for a Michelin star resto in San Francisco that has some seriously GOOD value..this is probably your spot! Total bill came out to be just shy of 1k for 7 people with 1 a la carte order and 3 bottles of wine. Woot!

Awesome food here - come with a group of 4 so you can try everything! We tried everything on the menu and bought additional of dishes we liked. Definitely dangerous on the wallet. We came roughly 60 minutes before opening on a Monday afternoon without reservations and we weren't even the first in line. The line was quite long by the time the restaurant opened. The food comes to you almost in a dim sum tapas style kind of way - they bring out the food with a price tag on it and you simply say if you want it or not. There are additional items you can order off the menu. Food was pretty good with mostly hits. There was a few misses, but we wanted to give everything a try. Our total bill including tip, tax, corkage, desserts, and a pitcher of beer came out to be $500. This is probably on the pricier side for four, since we bought a few items more than once with a vacation mentality. Overall the experience was good and I would definitely come back if given for a special occasion.

I have had State Bird Provisions bookmarked for years and FINALLY got to try it. We had reservations so getting seated was a breeze. I am just so confused....why is this place rated so highly? The food was very mediocre. I went with two friends and we were so excited to finally try State Bird Provisions, but progressively got more depressed as the meal went on. We tried pretty much everything offered in the carts / trays and nothing stood out. I think people are more impressed with the concept rather than the food? It's basically high-end dim sum, from the flavors to the cart concept. I would not go back since the asian fusion left me feeling unsatisfied.This is JUST my opinion so please don't let it sway you from trying it because you might love it.

Really? I'm still perplexed how this restaurant can be given That Many stars. Dim sum place where you feel like you're sitting in Chinese market stall although you when you see the prices of all dishes you realize your in the finer parts of San Francisco. Don't get me wrong, the concept of sharing is lovely and the idea behind it is nice. But. It feels superficial and as a guest I consistently felt bed every time I gave a 'No thank you' when one of the waiters came with a new dish to try (to buy), and placed a big tray on our table.Instead of it being a curious experience, I just felt it was unnatural and interrupting to my friend's an I's conversation. We had many courses, including oysters with plenty of chili. I wasn't impressed; the chili overtook the oyster flavor and there was no taste of sea.It's hard to get a table if you reserve (you need to book 2 months ahead), but if you come in by 5:30/6 PM they may be able to put you on the list. That's how it worked out for us and we got a 7:30 seating, which meant we had some time for a glass of wine at the wine bar around the corner.

Yummy small bites, constantly changing menu, and great service. I did not have a reservation, instead I waited for their doors to open for a walk-in seat. I waited ~45 mins earlier and was third in line (boba guys and good company made the wait pass quickly). I was seated right away at the counter (which I definitely recommend!!!).Since we were at the counter, we had the chance to chat up our line cook (i think that's the proper title) was amazing! Joshua was great at engaging and answering all of my questions. I felt like the experience was so much better because of him. It was great to watch the BTS of the whole operation. Between my sister and I, we ordered ~10 dishes. It was definitely enough for us to feel full without bursting at the seams. When asked what we should get, the server mentioned that the toasts/pancakes are must-trys and I definitely agree! We got one toast and one pancake and both were ranked high on my list. I also liked the garlic knotted sour dough bread. It was super savory and had a unique texture. The shot of peanut milk was something I've never seen anyone offer before. It would accompany any of the other desserts well. Though I enjoyed my experience a lot, I think my two criticisms would have to be that the small plates, though little in portion, were extremely heavy. A lot of the items had some kind of fat incorporated into it, delicious for sure but heavy. I would be more mindful to also order some lighter items to balance everything out. Another small critique was on the desserts. It's a pet peeve of mine when people name things specifically for marketing purpose and I was disappointed by their "bao." It definitely laid closer to the side of a cream puff, so what I received was different from my expectations. Overall, I would come back if a friend wanted to try and I've waited long enough for the menu to change out more. I completely support this establishment and love their concept!

THE HYPE IS ACCURATE. I ventured into this culinary experience with the highest expectations. And typically, that only sets you up for disappointment. But this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten.STRATEGYI've been making attempts to try this place for weeks, but online reservations are hard to come by- if not impossible. Luckily, they do set aside some spaces for walkins, so if you have the flexibility (and patience) - give it a try! I recommend lining up before the restaurant even opens (5:30pm) for the shortest wait time, or else expect to wait an hour or two. We lined up at 5:15 on a Thursday evening - there were already ~20 people in front of us. By 5:40 we were seated at the bar! This provided the most interactive experience and allowed us first dibs at everything coming out of the restaurant - if you're a small party, try and snag these seats! FOODThey have a traditional menu as well as do 10-15 dishes dim sum style, pushing carts or carrying trays around the restaurant. **Don't get ahead of yourself and start ordering everything! Play the slow game, and peek at everything coming out of the restaurant. There's a lot of options, and you don't want to fill yourself up so quickly!** For two, we had the following:***MUST TRY!!***--Yeasted poppyseed beef tongue pastrami pancakes: THE BEST ITEM WE ATE. GET IT - SO GOOD! The description of this item piqued our interest, so we decided to try it out. Who would have thought these flavors would go so well together! The cook (who we ordered though, watched him make our food, and who delivered the dish to us personally) recommended eating this like a mini sandwich to get the flavors of each component in every bite. --Quail dumplings: YUM YUM YUM. These were so tasty, and the broth was light but rich in flavor. DEFINITELY order these!***Recommended!***--Oysters: Sitting at the oyster counter we got their first oysters of the evening, which were incredibly refreshing and sweet. They add some garnish and sauce to their raw oysters which really compliments the flavor. --Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes: Their pancakes are petite and fluffy, with unique flavors. They come two to an order, and were delectably light, with the cheeses complimenting one another subtly. The sauerkraut is a powder they make in house - I typically don't care for sauerkraut but this was very palate friendly and tasty!--CA state bird with provisions: Fried with a reduced onion base underneath. Not what I was expecting (never had quail fried before), but tasty nonetheless!--Black sesame "ice cream" sandwich, black sugar macaron, milk chocolate & candied ginger: Delicious! The black sesame ice cream was a perfect, not overly sweet flavor to finish up the meal. The macaron cookie had a complimentary chewy texture and sweetness, and the candied ginger gave a little kick at the end. ***Comparatively not as impressive***--Pork belly: Crispy and fatty, accompanied by a citrus salad. It was tasty, but not as uniquely creative as the rest of the menu.--"World peace" peanut muscovado milk: A shot of peanut milk was much heavier than I was expecting (peanut flavored milk rather than milk made from peanuts). Very peanuty in taste with significant sweetness. What really impressed me about State Bird Provisions was the unique combination of flavors, textures, savory and sweet, and ingredients. They made strong tastes more subtle, and brought the flavors out of typically overlooked ingredients. Dining here was a very pleasurable activity - we had fun watching the cooks, guessing what different passing dishes were, and savoring each bite of our experience. I will definitely be back - sooner rather than later.

For the wait and the price, Statebird Provisions is not worth it. After waiting for an hour and paying $$$ to feel like you just had a few snacks, this was very disappointing. Pros: the ambiance is super nice and urban chic (yea I just created that word - it means cute but street), the staff is very nice and knowledgable, they have their own sommeliers, and they have dim sum carts going around with varied price food. The squash Mochi, Guinea hen dumpling, and the smoked trout avocado dip were some knockouts while their beer selection is amazing! Cons: The dim sum carts have over priced pricing for some things - didn't know a side of extra chips is 4 dollars. Also, for 37 dollars (5 pieces - it's 30 for 4 pieces) the Statebird is honestly not that good and it's so small! The duck liver mouse was great but itsy bitsy. Also, the servers tend to rush you once you are there for more than an hour--ultimate no no. Don't get me wrong, I love tapas style and I still think Statebird Provisions is a great place (maybe just for small bites), but it's not amazing and dare I say it... Worth all of the hype. I suggest going to progress or getting regular dim sum if you want to be full after dinner.

State Bird Provisions is a bit overhyped in my opinion. It's the ultimate FOMO (fear of missing out) experience. Not only is it difficult to snag reservations (make it 60 days in advanced folks!) There's not a real menu of all the dishes they offer from the carts. I was able to snag last minute reservations a day before. A few dishes we ordered:hog island oyster, kohlrabi kraut & sesameCA state bird with provisionsSteak TartarePork belly & citrus saladSmoked duck 'tsukemono' with umeboshi-rosemary vinaigretteGarlic bread with burrataYuzu 'ice cream' sandwichOur bill came out to be around $92 with tax and tip.None of the food blew my mind and for what I paid, it's about the same price as edomae sushi a la carte. The whole concept of provisions is tapas served dim sum style. Think small dishes being passed around by a tray or a cart. The provisions aren't presented on the menu. I'm not sure how often they rotate but I recommend doing a little research prior to your meal here. One of the servers said you're better off coming in knowing exactly what you want from the provisions and they can order it for you. Each round of reservations is about an hour long after you've been seated. About 14 dishes are passed around. It's almost like a tasting menu but you can decline or accept any of the dishes offered. There were a few I missed out on (either they didn't come by my table or they ran out.) The one thing that seemed to go around endlessly were the smoked-trout chips and avocado dip.

The flavor is out of control. It is either way too salty or way too sour. Unbalanced flavor takes away the taste of ingredients. Dishes like oyster, i barely taste the oyster because the obsessive amount of sauerkraut on top of it. The breading of fried quail covered all the taste of quail. I couldn't tell what kinda meat I am eating. The quail is not cooked tender as well. Although there are some highlights like octopus and lime pork belly, I am still super disappointed.

OH MY LORD! State Bird Provisions is definitely my top 5 restaurants in SF!! I went with a group of 9 people and it's provides a full tasting menu. It includes 4 different sections with about 4-5 dishes each which also includes desserts. I highly recommend getting a reservation but if not, you can line up at the door (before they open) and do walk-ins unless you want to wait hours. Love the environment and the service was great! If you're not doing the full tasting menu, the concept is pretty much a dim sum style. Anything you choose is delicious and you wont be disappointed. I will definitely come back here again!

I've been to State Bird a total of 3 times. Twice with le bf and once with my dad. I'm going to say that if you've never been, it is worth going at least once. It is one of those SF institutions. Will I be back for a 4th round? Only time will tell. I always make sure to get the dumpling with aromatic broth, the oysters, pork belly, some type of poke/tartar, 1 or 2 toasts/pancakes, fried rice, and half of the state bird with provisions. I really wish I could recommend some of the dishes, but none are worth really recommending, because it seems like different people have REALLY different opinions about the food served here. Some people really like it, and some just don't. It is very easy to spend a lot of money here, but not leave full. Once, I made my bf pick up McDonald's fries for me on the way home because I was still hungry. The food is ehhhhh but the concept is cool/different. Le bf and I have been to The Progress, which is their sister restaurant, and we liked it here more than at the Progress. Pro tip: If you want to eat here, make reservations. I believe they take reservations up to 2 months in advance. If I was going to come back here again, I would make sure to make my reservation for exactly 2 months out to get the time I would want.

Really deserving of the hype, and then some. SBP is a dim sum / tapas-style restaurant, featuring mostly small- to mid-sized dishes that are meant for sharing.Therefore, perhaps the best way to enjoy SBP is with a large group. This way, we got to try a set menu of 17 dishes in one sitting, most served family-style. It was all $65 per person when we visited (it may be more expensive now), which we thought was a bargain given not only the number of dishes served but also their quality and creativity. Otherwise, you'll either dine a la carte, or you'll choose from special offerings carted to your table dim sum style. Either way, there's a large variety of dishes to choose from at different price points.Moreover, it's probably easier to get reservations with a large group. Instead of jumping online at midnight two months prior and trying to snap up any table that's left, you can contact the restaurant directly and arrange for a large group numbering anywhere from 6 to 16. You'll sit with your group at a large picnic-style table, and the entire reservation and re-confirmation process is a breeze.Of the 17 dishes we tried, all were so good, in fact, that it feels like nitpicking to describe which ones were our favorites. The menu started with a course of 6 smaller / appetizer-sized dishes, then moved on to 5 other dishes that were either hearty salads or were slightly heavier in nature, and then featured 4 heavier, meatier dishes before ending with 2 small desserts. In the first course of 6, we started some Hog Island oysters seasoned with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame. Not only were the oysters fresh, but any "fishiness" was eliminated and, in fact, complemented by the kraut and sesame. Another enjoyably satisfying melange of flavors came with small, individually-sized whole-grain pancakes topped with heirloom tomatoes and Cabot cheddar. Similarly, chopped cucumbers topped with kinako and black sesame felt quite nourishing going down. A "chip and dip" course that came with horseradish creme fraiche topped with Coho salmon roe was at once salty, tangy, and roe-y. Yet again, all these flavors worked well with each other instead of clashing. Then, some duck liver mousse served with almond biscuits was sinfully satisfying. I often brace myself for a horrible, excessive, liver-y taste when I see "liver" on a menu, but this was so well executed I could have eaten the entire chunk of mousse on its own off the plank. Nevertheless, the almond biscuits were fantastically complementary with the mousse.The next course of 5 started with some garlic bread with burrata; while seemingly simple on the surface, it was deliciously well-executed and was a joy to wolf down. Then came a series of satisfying salads, like a summery one with chanterelle, ham, and fregola, and one with fresh Hawaiian hearts of palm and tahini-chili oil. Particularly memorable was the pork belly pluot salad, with the pork belly fried so perfectly that it tasted like Chinese crispy roasted meats you'll see hanging from butcher shop rotisseries and window displays in Chinatown - but *even* better. Next, a cast-iron dish of quail eggs with cucumbers and goat milk queso fresco left us all moaning approvingly in our umpteenth foodgasm of the night. The fun continued with the next series of 4 heavier dishes. The namesake California state bird with provisions (really fried quail) was fried perfectly and simply delightful going down. The next dish turned something as supposedly simple as fried rice into a real culinary statement with the benefit of kimchi, maitake, and smoked egg bottarga. Two more meaty dishes, the Don Watson's lamb with cumin, squid, shishitos, and dates, and the red trout with toasted hazelnut-mandarin-garum vinaigrette, helped fill us up further.The two desserts - fig ice cream with walnut sandies and Asian pear, and a white chocolate-brown butter quince cake with vanilla cream and cocoa syrup - were a delightful way to round out the entire meal and cleanse the palate. Overall, the atmosphere, ambience, food, and service are top-notch. Everyone in our group couldn't help noting how lucky we felt to be in a region full of great restaurants that not only source a lot of their food locally, but also draw on global influences and inspirations to take things up a notch. We also felt lucky to be able to share such great food with great company. SBP not only takes things up many notches, but provides you with the perfect setting to create your own special memories with your own good friends - not to mention a great way to mark my 1300th review!

Always make reservations in advance or if you walk in come when they open up. Got lucky and got 2 seats at the chefs counter. Waiter explained how to order food so you can get a taste of all the different delicious flavors packed in many small dishes. All have unique tastes. Farm to table feel. Order an item from each section then make room to try their small dishes that come around in carts. Perfect way to enjoy all those flavorful tapas. Love this place! I'll definitely be coming back.

I fail to see what the hype is about here... another typical Michelin star overhype.The wait is to be expected - get in line before they open and put your name down for later in the evening. What was not expected was the 25min wait at the host stand after our scheduled arrival time (with attitude from the host as the kicker). Tons of people (walk-ins and resys) had to wait much longer than their scheduled time....maybe because their entire concept does not lend to predictable service flow...The service was kinda odd (as I find typical at some overhyped Michelin spots). There is always an air of awkwardness, like tiptoeing around the diner. Trying to be friendly and funny with an obvious air of caution lends itself to uncomfortability...The food was fine, but nothing was memorable or had a characteristic 'mmmm' moment. The dishes feel haphazardly composed and didn't strike me as unique or creative. We had a mix of cart dim sum and classics of the menu. The quail had an odd flavor too it. The cart dishes that did taste good, had some very odd visual appeals or textures to them. The best dish we had was the peach dish for dessert...I left with a drained wallet and not a full stomach. You are better off spending your cash and time at some of the many many other delicious restaurants in this town!
