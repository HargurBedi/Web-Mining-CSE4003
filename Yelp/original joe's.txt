I was in Original Joe's today with a friend the service was great the food was horrible.The Duggan family has a lot of work that's needs to be done to get the food to the standards of the original (original Joe's) on Taylor street.Service was good price was good the friendliness of the restaurant was good the restaurant was good but the food was not so good I would not recommend going there until its gets better.

Original Joe's was a San Francisco institution. It stood strong through 70+ years of an ever changing San Francisco. And yet, remained delightfully old school. This restaurant was a beacon of happiness and joy in the middle of one of San Francisco's most gritty streets.Original Joe's had, without a doubt, the best burger I have ever had. But the rest of the food was only somewhat good. I am not giving Original Joe's 5 stars because of the taste of the food, but because of its history and character. It was truly an icon. I hope the owners rebuild the restaurant, and exactly identical to the way it looked for the previous 70 years. No frills! No new high tech kitchen! Just the same old Joe's that many in San Francisco had loved for all those decades.

Having spent many a dinner at the San Jose version, we had to try this one. The waiter's are experienced and older, elegant in tuxedos, with equally delightful old style manners. Scampi, veal Parmesan and lasagna were all delicious, the garlic bread was saturated with garlic as ordered. An old tradition that might need to remember stuffy is out of style. Then, the meal was ruined by the cockroach running across the table.

PLEASE reopen the original location!I see that they are opening "uptown" Joe's in the Hotel Majestic. I sure hope this isn't going to replace the original. Without the atmosphere straight out of a Tarantino script, half (or more) of the appeal is gone.I also love the incongruous performance space at the original. I once saw a "clown play" after dinner there.Only in SF!

What use to be the biggest steak-size burger in the city, has shrunked in recent years. Original joe's was a great restaurant,when i was younger. Now it is just "Ordinary-Joe's". Still, not a bad restaurant!One funny thing: A asian lady asked the waiters at joes, "Do you have "RICE" as side-order?"

One of THE best options for pre- or post-Tenderloin activity drinks. But I feel I have to ask...just exactly what will you be doing in the Tenderloin? Technically, they close at Midnight, but I've seen them stay open later, making this an ideal spot to chill over drinks or a meal after a Warfield show or play at The Exit. Once, after seeing P.J. Harvey around the corner, my friend and I ducked into an emptying OG Joe's. I asked the host, "Can we still get a table?". To which he replied in accented English, "Why not?". Dynamite.  I love the atmosphere here and I've never had a problem with any of the food. I recommend the ravioli, Joe's Special, the pot roast or (for cheapskates) any of the muhongous sandwiches. A BLT is damn near as big as a size 12 sneaker and twice as tasty. There's also a banquet room in back. If you do things in banquet rooms. Pretty cool. However, OG Joes is prolly not so cool for vegetarians. Quoth Laura B., "some best quality people watching". Respect.

I love the fare, I adore the bar, this grand restaurant is San Francisco when the city wasn't a septic tank full of dirty libs and flower children. I would frequent more often if junkies wouldn't use the hood of my car as a puke bowl.anyhoo ! try the fried calamari app and the hamburger steak rare -- you haven't tasted anything better in your whole life !

I have to say that OJ's is the best spot in town. Why you ask? Well where in this yuppie filled town can you go where nothing changes. The food is always good, the staff treats me like an Emperor, Oh cause I'm. The grill man will tell me whats good. The drinks are stiff. It's like walking in to the TL at another era, to me I'm glad they have been around for 65 years!!!!Plus Marie, John and John Jr are great people! If you beg to differ than all I can say is "who cares what you think anyway"

Oh, the heartbreak to hear OJ's is closed. My father distracted me there on my 30th birthday while my wife gathered together a large surprise party at our house. I sipped many a martini there with Rick Wilkinson, who could always drink me into oblivion. I turned to their large (deadly) plates of spaghetti or their mesquite-grilled hamburgers (before we all knew about mesquite) for sustenance when times called for desperately OJ measures. How many memories. I once led a troup of out of towners from the Flash Forward awards show there, promising that if they kept stepping over the drunks and around the hookers we would get to the promised land. Oh memories. Oh loss.

1993, back in the dark ages, my first trip to The City. Rainy, overcast, cold. Driving up and down the hills in style with my sky blue, white roof 1978 Ford LTD. Eventually, hunger set in. A buddy from college mentioned Original Joe's, just a few blocks away from our hotel in the TL. What an oasis. Home away from home. Comfort food with extra comfort. A towering portion of ground chuck with all kinds of spices and extras. An hour later, the hunger was gone - but the love affair with Original Joe's had just begun.To this day, I take friends to the place which is quintessential San Francisco to me. Never mind the neighbourhood or the sometimes shady figures there. But do mind the characters you meet inside. A middle aged night club singer and painter, munching away on his sandwich in the bar section of the restaurant, his hat neatly placed next to him. A bunch of motorcycle policemen, strengthening themselves before going out on the beat on New Year's Eve. A dressed up couple, probably just in from the opera, getting cozy and forgetting everyone around them.If you think that you live in San Francisco and haven't been to Original Joe's, you haven't really lived in San Francisco. Easy as that.

Came with a large group of guys on friday night. We had reservations but it wasn't crowded. The interior is different from most places I've been to. It's kind of a cross between a nice restaurant and a diner. The waiters are dressed in tuxes but you could wear shorts and a t-shirt if you wanted. Definitely a good place to go with your buddies.The menu is huge so there's something for everyone. I went with the burger and wasn't disappointed. It's a huge chunk of juicy beef on french bread, which doesn't fall apart like normal buns. One of the better burgers I've had in sf. The fries were only ok, a little soggy. The portions here are huge! Most of us couldn't finish our dishes and we're all guys in our 20's with big appetites.The highlight of the meal was definitely the service. Our waiter Paul did a great job taking care of us. But even more importantly, he was hilarious, crackin jokes on us like he was one of the boys and putting up with our antics as we got more and more drunk.

This is one of the first restaurants I ate at when I moved to San Francisco, and it almost made me want to turn back and go home! I can say without a doubt - this is the worst restaurant food I have ever eaten in my life! Read my one star as zero, because that's what this crap-hole deserves.Nothing we were served was edible-- and I really mean that, and our Frankenstein waiter was too scary to send it back. The bacon was old and flavorless, the salad seemed to have accidentally fallen into the deep fryer before it was served to us, and even the ketchup tasted rotten. The entire place looked like it hasn't been cleaned since it was opened and there is a unpleasant smell emanating from the interior that was disconcerting similar to the reeking homeless people slumped against their front door. This place was an absolute disaster in every sense of the word. Avoid it at all costs - it's better to go hungry!

Located where the Tenderloin is at its seamiest, with drunks passed out curbside and crack whores working the corners, this San Francisco institution no doubt survives due to its proximity to the Golden Gate Theater, since it's the only decent dining spot within walking distance in an area where people fear to walk. It's been here forever, and looks it - the interior is dark and dusty, and everything - including the old-timer waiters - seems to have a thin veneer of grease clinging to it. The menu won't attract food snobs, since the cuisine is primarily steaks, chops, and the like with an Italian flair. Portions are huge and usually require a doggie bag, a drawback only if you're headed to the theater after dinner. Prices are high considering the location. OK for a pre-show dinner, but one of the last places I'd consider if going out just for a meal.

is the food great? no. it's plentiful, but it's not great. but this is why you have to go. the last time i was there, i sat at the bar with my friend. in order, we watched an old man pour sugar into his sierra nevada for a good 15 seconds. then we watched a fat man with a long beard sweet talk a teenaged prostitute he just purchased minutes ago. then we listened to a group of singers belt out a bunch of broadway tunes to an audience that thinks they were singing about the hungry i. and then there was a bald man with black glasses who walked around with a heavy limp. i'm not saying that'll happen when you get there. but i'll say that you can't make up something like that. that's why you should go there.

One of the last of "Old San Francisco" restaurants, with waiters still in traditional tuxedos. Top quality food at reasonable prices, you will never go wrong here or leave hungry. The hamburgers, hamburger steaks, and pasta are to die for, nobody in the city does it better. They continue to survive in a rough area were most would have moved or folded long ago.

Nothing good ever lasts, and I am nervously awaiting the day that Original Joe's is no longer. I hope the day never comes, but we're tempting fate here because this place is a freakin' time warp. They haven't made restaurants like this in a long time, which is a shame. The service is above and beyond, I've seen the waiters, in their penguin suits and towels over their arms, treat tenderloin res hotel trash like they are royalty. I don't know how they have been able to maintain this place so well in the heart of the TL, but it's gorgeous. The burger and fries tops my all-time list.

As the product of a Sicilian family, I can confirm that this place is definitely old school Eye-tal-yan. It rocks. The grand dame even wears a sparkled polyester blend jacket, just like Gma used to wear. Huge dishes of pasta--all made with the ham-fisted style perpetrated by Dago Gmas everywhere, and two bottles of wine for under $70. Can't be beat. And the waiters are total flirts, so you can usually weasel some dessert out of em. Great place, great bar. For me, it's little taste of home.

My mom visited me this past weekend, and was dying to try out all the restaurants in my hood (ie the tenderloin) that she had heard about thru "travelpedia" (aka wikipedia for travelers?). Anyway, this joint was the top of her list. I have to be honest, a lot of food in the TL scares me, unless it is recommended by friends. The odd thing about this place is that the minute you walk in, you feel like you've left the TL. It has the feel of a diner, not so much a restaurant. The menu is heavy on the meat, but I settled on penne alfredo. My mom got the breaded eggplant. We were both pleased.Overall, this place is cute. Lots of old people, so I'm not sure about the cocktails that some other yelper mentioned (although I did notice that just about every old man at the counter had some kind of alcoholic drink).Downfalls: overpriced, and lingering smell of smoke on the clothes (due to and open grill).

We went because it was close to the Golden Gate Theater and I had several family members with me that didn't want to walk around too much in the neighborhood. The food was fine but forgettable, the table was a bit small, and the service was awkward and slow. We did see a cast member of the show we were waiting to see dining with her family (hair up in rollers under a baseball cap bearing the show's name) there so obviously it's a fine choice when you're near the GG. But there are plenty of places I'd rather go.

Great Italian Sausage and Italian rice/risotto, but you can only get the rice side dish on Wednesdays and Sundays. I'm not a huge fan of the Iced Tea (not a total deal breaker, but I haven't found the perfect Iced Tea in SF yet, please advise!), but the wait staff is super nice. It was refreshing to have a waitstaff all dressed up like I was at a similar restaurant in Chicago or New York. Whatever you do, don't call the manager "stretch!" I'll spare you the details.

An Italian favorite institution where the waiters wear the red blazers paired w/black slacks. Atmosphere is a little dark and dingy, but the food is good and consistent, which is why they keep their customers for so many years. Pastas, veal, chicken are all good. Not for the faint of heart or tourists as it's in the middle of the Tenderloin. Order to go if it's not your thing.

I used to love to come here to have a hamburger and a drink before a show but after my last experience I will NEVER go there again. This town has TOO MANY RESTAURANTS for RACISM. I am a NATIVE SAN FRANCISCAN and I'm just not used to that crap! The LAST time that I was there they had ONE Black waiter and he was working in another section. They sent him over to wait on me and my friend. I know this for a fact because I worked in food and beverage for 10 years and I understand the concept of sections. Another couple came to sit in our SAME section and they got waited on by someone else. It took us 40min. to get 2 hamburgers while the couple next to us had their food within 15minutes. Well I say that's bullshit. Oh and incidentally that place is dark and filthy looking and we had to return the bread twice because it had mold on it! They need to come up to the present tense because in business the only color that should be seen is GREEN!!!
