EVENT: We had a large party... like seriously (maybe no so serious) large party! Maybe like 30 f us??? It's a classroom full! LOCATION: in the heart of SF... downtown, right next to union square, Macy's, and everything around it! It's such a perfect place to show friends from out of town. I was honestly kinda shocked and surprised by how lovely the restaurant is! It's soooo sweet and lovely! We came here with reservations at 6:30pm-ish, we walked in, and in the back there's tables set up for us with candles and a small little set menu. It was wonderful and sweet! **If you have a large party - highly recommended! SERVICE: BEST SERVICE EVER! Y'all know.. we're an annoying little bunch! I'm so glad we dealt with us with patience! Highly recommend! Server boy took our drink orders and we kept on changing it.. he didn't even look annoyed hahaha! FOOD: we had a large group, so we had a set menu(1) Cesar Salad - delish!(2) Steak - came with fries and green long beans! The fries was perfectly made and the beans too! Not to soft! And crunchy!(3) Cheesecake - super sweet and super soft. Typically I like my cheesecake a little harder... but still yums!**OVERALL: Perfect for big groups! Food was so good and perfectly made even though we had so many people!

The food was really good. The only reason for not giving five stars is the waiter. He took our order and then basically ignored us. Was filling coffee for all his other tables. Never even looked at us. O found the whole thing odd. Oh well. The food was great so what are you gonna do...

I've been here numerous times over the years whenever we were visiting the city and needed a great breakfast. I haven't been back to San Francisco in a number of years I was excited to take my coworker to breakfast here as she's never had the pleasure. I recall that there was usually a wait to get a table with the line going out to the sidewalk, I guess we beat the morning rush as we got there around 7:30 am on Monday morning, no wait and just a few other tables dining. I was a little concerned that the quality had slipped but thankfully the food was as I remembered.Food: I ordered the Swedish pancakes with a side of bacon. I know, not very creative but I really like those little pancakes. 4 large slices of thick bacon cooked nice and crispy, the pancakes were served in 6 stacks of 3 each and perfectly cooked. These aren't the thick, fluffy hot cakes but thin, crisp edges, that are perfect bites when combined with just the right amount of butter and syrup.Service: Our server was attentive, refilled our coffee several times, order taken quickly and food hit the table in just a few minutes. The restaurant was pretty empty when we sat, by the time we were leaving it was filling up nicely. I guess I've always come later in the past. Atmosphere: Hasn't changed a bit in all the years I've been coming here. Rustic, homey, comfortable, warm, and just a great place to grab breakfast.Value: It is a little pricey for breakfast but it is right off Union Square and they have a wonderful selection from Benedicts, to omelets, waffles, pancakes, and a great selection of sides.Overall: Still a solid place for breakfast, will definitely be back in the future.

My kids and I were coming to town for a fast weekend trip arriving at 7am from our red-eye trip on the Megabus. I knew that breakfast would be the first and most-important thing we did to set the tone for this weekend's trip. I chose this restaurant for the historic and comfortable feel of the restaurant itself but also for the history that I have with it. I used to come to San Francisco at least once every 1-2 years either with my college roomie who was from No Cal, or for USC Trojan football road games, or to run or work the Nike Women's marathon until they stopped running it. We used to come to this restaurant the morning after the marathon to replenish our bodies with what we'd burned so I figured starting here would fuel us for the day of site-seeing ahead. Our three-thumb review is 3 buttery thumbs up in a flurry to pass the food around and try each other's dishes. I loved that the restaurant has a beautiful structure to it and with its charming relics on display you almost feel the history. The people working there feel like family and you know there must be a grandma somewhere in the back saying "Here, you must have more!" My tween daughter loved that the waffle was bigger than her head! They were crunchy outside, slightly fluffy inside with a gentle sweetness. If we could take it home with us, it'd have fed her for a few days. My teen son loved that portions are huge and the flavors homemade and as he'd expect them to be - no fusion dishes, straight up great omelette, hash browns and sourdough toast. Sears is exactly what you'd want out of an old favorite breakfast joint! #Vacation #Familyfun #Delicious #GenerousPortions #Breakfast #Brunch #Lunch #Dinner #UnionSquare #SanFrancisco #Family #Historic #ComfortFood #ThreeThumbReviews #Blogger #MakesMeWander

After our holiday overnight stay at the Drake directly across the street, we decided to give this Iconic establishment a try. We came for breakfast and was seated immediately. It must have been good timing because when we left, there was a line formed outside. Our server brought us two piping hot cups of coffee. We had the two egg breakfast. I had mine with country potatoes and hubs had his with hash browns. My eggs were perfectly scrambled and his was over easy. The food came out quickly and there were no complaints. We had an enjoyable breakfast while enjoying the view outside our window watching all the holiday shoppers and tourists. We'll gladly come back if we're ever in the area!

I would say the food here is truly just mediocre. If you're looking for a nostalgic setting, it's definitely a cool place; however, the food was nothing to write home about. I had eggs Benedict and the biscuit was really really soggy. If you go, stick with something simple like the pancakes!

We stayed at Drake's for a night and decided to cross the street for a brunch spot. Saw pictures of the dollar pancakes and was quite excited to find out if there was anything special about it. It was busy around 1030 but we managed to get a seat for two by the window. Lovely spot as we watched folks pass by during this big post holiday shopping opportunity. We watched the ornately dressed beefeater from Drake's greet and assist customers as they enter/depart from the hotel. The lingonberry sauce was a flavorful match with the Swedish pancakes. The whipped butter alone was not sufficient. I wanted to ask for more lingonberry but the waiter said it would be an additional $2.50. Darn! Hubby ordered the eggs benedict and it was okay. Overall price for our two meals with orange juice was around $60. Quite pricey for out of town folks like us but it's a convenient spot for brunch. Food flavors were fine. What makes this spot an interesting find is that it dates back to the history of a retired circus clown named Ben Sears. It was established in 1938 about 10 years after Sir Francis Drake hotel was built. Interior decor consists of antique items that represented its age. Mr Sears was known for his Swedish pancakes and traditional American food. Multiple celebrities in the past have dined here over the years including Bill Clinton. It's always a good thing to know a bit about history because you just don't know that you could be walking on the same ground as they had. searsfinefood.com/history

The name of this place is accurate. The food is very good. I got the world famous pancakes with bacon, and hot chocolate as a drink. Everything was delicious, and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. However, the service is the reason this isn't a five star review. The waiter took a while to serve our food, which I expected because we ordered quite a bit of food. But the waiter didn't come back for a long time. My parents had drank all of their coffee, and even though they were promised free refills, the waiter never came back to refill the coffee. In fact, he didn't come back at all until we were done to give us the bill. So I took off a star for the service.

Went for dinner. Good dinner menu with great food at a reasonable price. Had the grilled new york steak sandwich ($18.95) with fries. It was good! Could've had more steak on it, but it was juicy and good.Not many beer options, but reasonably priced for downtown sf. Only $6 for 16oz craft beer.

The food was fine -- nothing to write home about. What I do want to hit home is the quality of the service though: I ordered a coffee and it took ten minutes to get to me. What? I was sitting right next to the mugs and the coffee brewer too, but my server still disappeared for ten minutes right after ordering. We had to prompt him TWICE to bring us our coffee too, because it seemed like he forgot (the first time he said he would bring it immediately, and then disappeared again.) It was pretty empty when we got there as well, so unsure of what was going on.Not coming back.

Sears restaurant has been in business since 1938 and is a San Francisco tradition. I have been eating there since my first trip to San Francisco in the 80's. Their food is excellent. They serve a large goblet full of fresh cut fruit which is so good and their French toast is amazing. We had the strawberry waffle which was piled high with strawberries and whipped cream. I also love their Eggs Benedict which are always cooked perfectly. It's always hard to pick what to order since everything is so delicious. Be aware since the food is so good that there might be a line but it moves fairly quickly. The service is friendly and brisk. I would not consider eating anywhere else for breakfast when you are in the area. I highly recommended Sears Fine dining.

As with all experiences, your mileage may vary, but mine was pretty good here! I came on Saturday around noon for brunch.There is no brunch trend here exactly, just a breakfast menu that is served until 3 pm. Service was very attentive, our party of 4 was seated immediately, and our dishes came out quickly. A pretty standard baseline that was satisfied. The Swedish pancakes + lingonberries are a good dish to share with the table as an appetizer of sorts. The omelettes are sizable and filling. The french toast was a little mediocre according to my friend.

My girlfriend and I came here after a terrible experience at another brunch place. Service- All the servers were really friendly and helpful while ordering. No complaints here. Food- Excellent. My girlfriend got the San Franciscan sandwich with Bay Shrimp, and it was remarkable. Placed on fresh, toasted sour dough bread with avocado and tomato, and Monterey jack cheese melting off the edges, I wished I ordered it until my pancakes came. They were fluffy, hot, and delicious. I finished half of them and happily took them home for a leftover meal. They melted in your mouth. Overall experience- Both positive and encouraging. I can't wait to come back to this great establishment. We played the slot machine and got 50% off a dinner! I cannot fathom why it only has 3.5 stars. Some people must be extremely picky.

Updated review
This is an update to my previous review from years ago.After several trips to San Francisco we decided to give Sears Fine Foods another try after being ignored at our table several years ago. We went in for breakfast and was seated right away before the morning crowd. The service was fast and our waiter was very good. I had a typical breakfast, 2 eggs scrambled with hashbrowns, wheat toast and bacon (had to pay extra for the bacon). The bacon was really good and there wasn't anything remarkable or special about the rest of the food. Hubby had a veggie omelet with hashbrowns and wheat toast which also wasn't anything special. We had a half order of the silver dollar pancakes and we don't see what the big deal is about those pancakes. The pancakes tasted like any other ordinary pancake, there was nothing special about the flavor, butter or the syrup. Overall the service was good, breakfast typical and plain and very expensive. Nothing special.

Definite tourist trap. Not really a trap, but definitely caters to the tourists. Something about their being a very old establishment in San Francisco. Its also along the cable car route. The food was ok. The service was good. The line to get in was long but moved fast. Can't say I would come back.

Finally, I wandered in after relocating to San Francisco almost 9 years ago and made it to Sears Fine Foods.I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and side of extra crispy fries. The fries worked and were crispy.Long ago I thought the messier the sandwich the better but I've evolved my thinking about sandwiches by now asking that filling remain nestled between bread versus shooting out the side and down the row of tables. Yes, I'm exaggerating, but the brioche bread did not work for this diner and so ate sandwich with knife and fork. The chicken was nicely grilled and, at the end of the day, when I re-introduced nicely grilled chicken to its brioche partner, the overall sandwich wasn't bad.The waiter was friendly and very attentive.Decor was old school replete with wood and provided comfort to this diner.

The hotel recommended this place as it is a San Fran icon. We got here very early and there were plenty of seats, but by the time we left, there was a line out the door.We sat at the counter and had a great waitress. I swear my coffee was never empty. It's a typical diner with typical breakfast food. If you want a decent breakfast, Sear's is a good choice. The French toast was nice. I took a bite of the sausage and bacon that came with my husband's entree. They were both good. It's nothing to write home about, but it was decent. I don't think I would wait in line to eat here.

I tried the salmon Benedict with a cappuccino . Everything was cooked very good! And the Benedict comes with hash browns that were cooked to a nice crisp. After I finished that, I decided to order a side of chicken apple sausage, and was not disappointed. There are many tables inside, so it seemed cramped, but at least I didn't have to wait in line for a table. Restrooms are also available, which were clean.I would recommend for a breakfast/lunch trip, since there are many things to choose from. I'm sure everyone could find something to enjoy.

This would've been 5 stars had the server not completely forgotten about me. He kept asking if we needed anything and I asked for a refill, he took my glass away and never returned with a refill. Asked again and he didn't bring it back. There were only three tables occupied (8 people dining in the restaurant at the time) so it wasn't terribly busy. Luckily I had a bottle of water in my purse so I didn't go thirsty.I love nostalgia and all things vintage so I loved this place. The food was good as well. I had the eggs Benedict which was fantastic but I agree the hash browns were bland. Added a little salt and pepper and they were transformed into brand new potatoes. Even added a little ketchup. The crab chowder was ok, I think I prefer clam chowder just in general. My dining partner had the salmon and enjoyed it. Would eat here again if we ever come back to the area.

The breakfast here was good but their famous pancakes are nothing out of this world. Being Dutch, they look similar to traditional pancakes we have in Holland, but these ones are your basic American pancakes just in little circles. You can order 18 of these as a portion which is enough to share, it comes with butter and syrup. We ordered eggs and bacon to share as well. Service was fast and friendly. Even though their was a line outside, it went by really quick. All in all, good breakfast just don't know what's so "famous" about this place besides it being in business for a really long time.

This was recommended to me by a friend who lives in San Francisco when I was visiting the city and looking for great breakfast food. The service was great. My eggs, corned beef hash and potatoes hash/rosti was excellent. It had none of the usual 'commercial-packaged-greasy taste' that many american 'diner foods' seem to have, especially at low to mid-priced restaurants and cafes in the US. The mini pancakes were light (good texture) and tasted alright, but it was nothing to shout about, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but more because of the high expectations I had since it is supposed one of their specialities. Overall a very good and solid breakfast experience and I would return. (I also went to Dotties and thoroughly enjoyed my experience there, but i would still rate this place half a point higher if I really to choose, because the quality of the food was better)

Went to Sear's for late lunch/early dinner tonight. This is an old school, SF classic. The waiter was funny and very friendly but a bit forgetful on who ordered what-but his charm made up for that in spades. Had the breakfast burger and it was cooked to perfection and was delicious. The restaurant was not overly crowded at this time of day so it made for a pleasant experience. Gave us each tokens for the slot machine when we left. Of our group of 6-no one won anything but it was fun anyway. Will be back to try breakfast

Been there for brunch / breakfast almost every time I stayed in the city in the past few years! Perfect location, never a long wait even it's always busy, great food, great mimosas, great service and most of all decent pricing and you don't pay $$$ for just eggs like some of the other places in the area. I definitely recommend it!Love the idea that they give token to play to get coupons in the end !

Talk about a great brunch option in SF. So good, this is the second time I've come to the city and 2nd time I've come to Sears! Even 4 years later, I still enjoyed my experience.Yes - you will most likely wait in line. Welcome to the SF brunch scene, but it's worth it. Great food, great experience, busy city!Being a party of one gave me flexibility in sitting at the bar, which I was fine with. The bartender/server was really friendly. Saw that I was in my Marlins gear & chatted with me about the upcoming Giants game I was going to that afternoon. No heckling, all in fun, which I appreciated.I ordered an OJ & hot chocolate (this Florida girl was cold on such a beautiful spring day). My favorite breakfast food is an eggs Benedict & Sears has options on this classic! i went with the Eggs Florentine, two poached eggs, english muffin, fresh spinach (to make it feel like a healthy option for me) to die for hollandaise sauce and crisp hashbrowns. I've had the world famous sweedish pancakes & the claims are true - they are fluffy perfection. The meals here are very filling, well priced & the hip place has some cool photo opportunities. Check out the slot machine while in line or on our way out!

I'm not sure where I read about Sears, but apparently this is a San Francisco tradition going back some 75 years. Swedish pancakes. It seems a bit odd to have them here on the Left Coast, but whatever. I'm all for tradition!There was a brief wait for a table but no wait for a seat at the counter so I went with that. Service was a bit slow with a long delay for my order, another for coffee and another for a coffee refill. He was pretty quick to take my money at the end though.Pancakes were excellent. I opted to go with the lingonberries and that was the right choice. If you're gonna go full Swede, go full Swede. The berries were nice and tart with just the right spreadable sweetness that the warm maple syrup was not needed.On my check, a 3% surcharge for San Francisco employee healthcare. So I carefully calculated 12% ($2.09) and left that as the tip.

From the genuine welcome of the hostess to the super prompt arrival of our waitress, all aspects of our experience demonstrated why Sears is a San Francisco legend. I ordered an egg white omelette packed with veggies. Delicious! My friend ordered scrambled eggs with ham. He received a generous slice of ham. We also tried the broiled grapefruit - interesting but sweet. The silver dollar pancakes are very popular here. Lots of menu choices.

Always a must stop when visiting San Francisco, make sure you get there early for breakfast - the line tends to start forming out the door by around 7 a.m. on any given day of the week, no matter what time of yearI've had the silver dollar pancakes w/ lingonberry sauce in the past - so good!!!My most recent visit, yesterday morning, I had the Eggs Benedict - they did not disappoint - prepared perfectlyThey are accommodating of menu change requests and had several options for my 4 1/2 yr old son, too - my wife and son ended up splitting 2 pancakes & oatmealCoffee is always hot and above average in comparison to most similar restaurantsEach party gets a token to play in the slot machine up at the front - I think you win free food on a future visit, but I've never won nor seen anyone get a winning spin, so not sure; but still fun nonetheless

We went here on our last day in San Francisco because this place was recommended my a local we were talking to. When you order, the prices will get jump at you a little because it's located in the financial district of San Francisco and lots of tourist come here. The quality of the food was amazing and I you get what you paid for in the amount of food. If you are looking for good breakfast food in the San Francisco area, I would recommend this place hands down. The servers are extremely friendly and will take great care of your family. The reason for 4 stars is because of the price was a little stiff.

Don't come in here! I'm not really sure how this place has so many stars! To start food is ok, nothing too special or out of this world in my opinion. It was my boyfriend graduation this memorial day weekend. So we decided to get a hotel in downtown SF. Another couple came with us. Monday morning everyone was hungry and my friends really wanted to try this place. After waiting in line for almost half an hour outside the restaurant. We still had to wait in line inside the restaurant too for another 10 min... while inside my boyfriend saw that it says the inspection score was only 78... I kinda wanted to leave, but my friends insisted and we had been waiting so long in line and hungry too. I ordered a breakfast dish which was very so so and it came with pancakes... as I'm halfway through my food I noticed a short hair in my pancake. So disgusting... called the manager and she said she "didn't see it". Called the waitress and she saw it right away... I felt like vomiting. No wonder why their score is so low. This probably happens to them often... and even though they remove the dish from my check. Oh man now I feel like I deserved more than that. I should have refuted to pay for our whole part of the check... but didn't feel like arguing in that moment since I was so grossed out... anyways, not a pleasent experience at all... and definitely not coming back! I can take some bad customer service in restaurants and things like that, but hair or anything that's not food on my plate is completely unacceptable. Very disappointed......

My wife and me ate dinner here. I ate the fatty burger and my wife ate fettuccine with pesto and grilled chicken. Burger was very good and filling. My wife loved her dish. The waiter was nice and service was fast. Thanks.

This is the second time I've been here, and I have to say I'm totally in love with this place. I must have lived in an earlier life because this place looks like it's right out of the turn of the 20th century, and I feel right at home. Mosaic tile floor, simulated gas lamp lighting, and in use antiques throughout, make this a favorite place for breakfast every time we are here.  The food is cooked to perfection, the staff is welcoming and friendly, what more could you ask for? How about an awesome dinner menu, and a full bar? Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, it's a good idea to get here ahead of time, because there is always a line out the door. I promise you though, it is well worth the wait.Until next review!

Breakfast was okay. The service was mediocre. Prices very high. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my husband ordered the Swedish pancakes with lingonberries. His food was good. Mine was just okay. The hash browns were good. The waiter did not check on us to see how our food was. He did, however, bring the check promptly. Probably would not go back. By the way, you que up outside to wait for a table.

Stayed in Union Square, went here for breakfast because I was craving chowder before leaving SF. However, no chowder in the early morning, eggs benedict would have to do. The eggs were tasty, hashbrowns needed salt. Overall, I enjoyed my meal. What compensated for the mediocre hashies was our waiter, Jonathan Ng. We told him we were in a bit of a rush and and he was very accomodating. You rock Jonathan!

Simple done well. Perfect eggs, crisp hashbrowns and bacon, and homemade strawberry compote for french toast. Quite a line outside for breakfast, but staff moves people in efficiently, so it wasn't too long. Prepare to drop some coin; breakfast for two was 40$.

Two dishes - the Swedish pancakes and the shrimp omelette. That's all we needed to start off our long day and boy they were good!!

A taste of old San Francisco! Not a lot of old school options left. Great breakfast here. I had the salmon eggs Benedict. So delicious! Great service.

Very disappointed this time around, as I took my 2yr old son to breakfast and was given a very badly selected table. I asked if we could get a booth where I could sit next to my son, to which I was told no... which is fine. After stating that we were leaving, the host then said he could get us a booth. We waited 20 minutes at the original table until he pointed us to the same type of table just in a different spot in the restaurant. I told him that it wouldn't work, and we left. If a restaurant is not willing to accommodate kids then it should not pass itself off as kid friendly and at a minimum don't have a customer wait for a booth that you really have no intention of seating them at.

Service was good, food was ok. It was a little dirty. We ate at the counter and when I would rest my arms on the bar they would stick to the counter. It was gross. Also had fruit flys buzzing around, and if you've ever watch Bar Rescue, you know what fruit flys mean. Unkept and dirty in the food prep areas.

Great place a few steps off Union Square. Great!! Excellent counter service like a NJ dinner. Perfect poached eggs. Hash browns were crisped to perfection. Endless coffee while watching the diversified parade of customers. If you are in the area, don't miss this place.

There wasn't a wait and our waiter was extremely friendly- however the food didn't leave a lasting impression.

We came here first tune 28 yrs ago. It was delicious. Jamie took great care of us, with a great attitude and warm heart.Pancakes were great and so were the eggs and bacon. Bacon and hash Brian's were done to perfection. Coffee was strong and bold. Enjoy!
