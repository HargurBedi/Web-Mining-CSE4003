A Michelin guide restaurant indeed! Everything I had here was nothing short of spectacular. We ordered the basteeya and braised beef cheek to share. The basteeya, or duck confit, looks like a fat egg roll but not as basic. It was a delicate flaky pot pie that was heartily filled with meat and packed with flavor. The plate had artistic white (crepe fraiche) and blue (blueberry) swirls and sour pickled Asian pears. Cutting into the braised beef cheek was satisfying in itself - it had a rather gelatinous texture, and simply melts when in contact with your tongue. Each dish is carefully presented and described by a different waiter. Ambience is romantic, classy, and vibrant. People were dressed professional/slightly fancy. If you don't have a reservation, no problem. The bar space is first come first serve, and offers complete dinner available to order.

Best cooked salmon I've ever had in my life. If you close your eyes and taste the filet - it's just as smooth as cod ! The appetizer proportion was decent for one person. I ordered a cocktail - the secret. Very elegant and tasted exactly as the waitress described. Lamb entree - adequate portions. Cooked three ways. Lamb belly mixed in the lentils , Lamb flank sliced on the side. Very good as welDessert - I got myself a honey almond (shaved ice). It's interesting in that it reminds me of Taiwanese shaved ice. There's bee pollen beeswax and almonds in it so it is naturally very honeyish. Quite a good play on the shaved ice scene All in all - 5 star review. You get what you pay for !Service - maxCost - above averagePortions - great for a michelin starTaste - max

2 words: short ribs. Their family style meals feeds four, and come with delicious side dishes paired well with the main. The short ribs came with four sides - kale, potatoes, couscous, and beans, and they are all good (but the potatoes are best). The short ribs themselves are melt-in-your-mouth heavenly, and perfectly seasoned. That's not to say you shouldn't get other items! For one, they have standard luxury items like oysters and caviar. There is an array of delicious appetizers and big plates that are more individually portions. However it's definitely best to come with more than 4 and get the family dinner. The service was great, and the environment was romantic and intimate, perfect for a date. Perhaps then, you could get the family dinner for your date and get the rest to go? ;)

After 1643 Yelp reviews, I'm thrilled to say this is my first Michelin Star restaurant and wow, what a delight this was! It is easily the best restaurant I've ever been to in San Francisco.Reservations - None. We sat at the bar so no wait time.Eggplant - Soft, refreshing, soothing, and perfect with the puree. It looks like a hodgepodge of veggies stacked in a row.Bread - Came with the eggplant. Incredibly delicious, soft, slightly salty, and melts in your mouth. This is the best bread I've ever had. We tried dipping it in sauces from other dishes but it took away from the flavor of the bread. Eat the bread by itself. Basteeya - Looks like an eggroll, but truly a duck pastry puff. How did they make outside so thin and crisp? If the texture hasn't won you over, dip it in the sour cream and suddenly this dish is God-like. Oh my goodness, it was literally the best sour cream I've ever had in my life. Couscous - Soft, tender texture, and addicting. Totally worth the $24. We couldn't finish this.Potatoes - Good. We couldn't finish this. Cocktails - Expensive but probably one of the best I've had. Order the Northern Fog. Stay away from the Cane is Abel. Service and Interior - Impeccable. The inside was gorgeous and intimate yet large enough to feel like you're going to eat something epic.

Best meal of my life.....How's that for an intro? I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday, and we got the star treatment. I am from out of town and was blown away that places this fancy and perfect even exist? I am also a vegetarian, and I was happy that there were multiple veg options on the menu. I could go on for days, but suffice it to say that every bite and sip of wine was absolutely divine and so special. The menu was a little different, which I really appreciated-not just the usual pasta for vegetarians, but a delicious couscous. And the desserts!?!??! Again-very different and amazing. The service couldn't have been better. Everyone was friendly and contributed to a pleasant, cool, fancy dining vibe.

This review is long overdue. I've been to Mourad on two separate occasions and both were absolutely amazing. I loved everything about the restaurant - the food, the impeccable service, and the modern interior.The food is beautiful, delicious, and so creative. My boyfriend and I both had the tasting menu, and we loved every bite. I still dream about the caviar in the hen egg, the lamb, and the couscous with brown butter. The tasting menu leaves you completely full. Expect to spend at least 2-3 hours.I've also tried the short ribs and the basteeya, and both were also delicious.

The flavors are just bursting! I've come to Mourad before to splurge for its dinner service, but I recently returned for their lunch, which has a somewhat similar menu. It's a great option for a fancy, quiet, sit-down meal (hopefully on an expense account)--every dish I tried was just delicious, and while pricey, the quality and flavors were absolutely worth it!First, I started with the soft, chewy flatbread seasoned generously with sumac, and it went perfectly with the three spreads--the yogurt-dill was reminiscent of cream cheese, the piquillo-almond had a piquant kick, and the eggplant tomato had a perfect combination of sweet and savory! The quinoa appetizer dish was a generous portion of lemony quinoa topped with asparagus and parmesan cream. For my entree, I had the duck bastilla, which consisted of shredded duck confit with spices, nuts, and golden raisins wrapped in a crispy phyllo pastry and dressed with a refreshing, light creme fraiche and pear on the side. Nice! The portion looked quite small on the plate, but this was a surprisingly heavy and filling dish. I thought the flavors could have been a little more vibrant, but it was delicious nonetheless!I'd definitely recommend Mourad if you're looking for quality food and great flavors--be prepared for the steep prices, but the impeccable ambiance and friendly service make this an enjoyable experience!

I don't normally give out 2 stars but I was underwhelmed by this place. I went for SO's birthday dinner and was excited to experience the food and ambiance.Mourad is a beautiful and elegant restaurant with sleek bar, suede banquette style seating and beautiful chandeliers. Mourad, as beautiful as it was, reminded me of a beautiful and charming older aunt/grandmother who is starting to get forgetful.When we got to the restaurant early (a little before 6:30), we were seated at a nice table that faced the grand staircase to the private room on the second floor. We sat down and ordered: Short rib entree for SO, scallops for me. In the interim we ordered their zatar infused flatbread with eggplant. The appetizer came on in a timely manner and we managed to savor the delicious fluffy flatbread and flavorful eggplant.After we finished out flatbread, we waited, And waited. And waited.I checked my watch - 7:45pm and still no sign of our entrees. I waited an additional 10 minutes before I flagged down a manager and asked if he could check on our entrees. Our server came back and said our dishes would be out in about 3-4 minutes. Our entrees finally arrived at our table and I was so hungry I had to start my meal right away.As soon as I bit into my scallop I noticed 2 things: 1) It was the so salty my tongue immediately recoiled 2) The temperature of the scallop was a little on the cold side, which meant that it was probably sitting under the lamp for a while. I sent my scallops back and asked for them to be unsalted and it came back quickly but by that time I had lost some of my appetite. Maybe I came on an off night but not sure if I'm going to go back again for dinner.

This was my first time having Moroccan food, so I really did not have a role model to compare Mourad with; however there was indeed no need to - Mourad is unique and irreplaceable, and I saw all the points it has gutted to nail that Michelin star.Followed my waiter's recommendation and went with the tasting menu. 10 courses plus some small bites here and there, I left completely stuffed yet more than satisfied. Reservation was tough yet not too difficult - most importantly, it was convenient to get to from where I lived.Four small bites to kick it off - including my all-time favorite Hokkaido uni. Of all the dishes, I greatly enjoyed the salmon and lamb (carnivore). Salmon was cooked actually less soft that I thought, yet I found myself surprisingly love the texture! Lamb, on the other hand, was well marinated and chewy. Before the dessert, they would also serve you the mint tea to clean up the palate - very considerate.Worth revisiting and trying some of the family-style dishes. Lastly, service was incredible - well covered from beginning to the end. A true delight.

First night of cocktails: 5/5Came here mainly for cocktails after getting recommendations from a bartender at Wilson & Wilson. The bartender here (JP), does an amazing job making cocktails. I would recommend stopping by whenever he works and let him choose what cocktails to make for you. I came in and took a look at their cocktail list with my girlfriend and her friend and they ordered the only ones I found interesting on the menu, so I told JP to create me any kind of cocktail in anyway he would like to. Pretty much I gave him a chef's choice but instead bartender's choice. Every drink he gave me was delicious, well rounded and astonishing. I would also say a highlight about their bar is their garnish game and all the tinctures and bitters that they have as well. Second night of cocktails: 3.5/5I also came back a second night to get cocktails, the cocktails were good but not as good as the night before. I ordered a ramos gin and fizz according to the recommendations from an employee there. Having many ramos before, this one was not up to par as others if anything way too watery possibly due to the amount of soda water incorporated in the drink since the drink itself did not have a correct rise as it should. However the variation of a last word the bartender made that night was excellent.Food on the second night: 3.5/5I ordered the octopus as well there and it was delicious but not amazing. I feel like the octopus could have been softer, assuming it was sous vide according to the employees. I believe the puree to the octopus dish was a cauliflower puree. It was good but I feel the dish was a little bland.

My brother and I treated each other here for our birthdays, and it was spectacular! Be prepared to dress just a tad fancier than "smart casual". There's nothing casual about this place. Many of the men were wearing jackets, and none were wearing teeshirts.We ordered several plates to share. Everything was fantastic; however, what keeps popping up in my memory is the eggplant dish with the bread that was served with it. Ambiance and service is top-notch, similar to steak houses in Manhattan. It was a delightful meal, all served beautifully. And there wasn't one dish I wouldn't order again. Now, back to the eggplant...

Nice ambiance but my impression of the food and service was a bit lackluster. Maybe because we only ordered several appetizers and an entree (we were not that hungry), but nothing stood out from this meal at all. The eggplant dish was very sour, the octopus was ok, but it was one tentacle cut into four pieces (which they did tell us before). The duck wrapped in pastry breading was pretty good. For the entree, the scallops were good as well. For dessert, we tried the froyo which was also very tart. The service was ok, but every time the waiters explained the dish, it sounded like they were reading from cue cards. Nice to try this place, but probably won't be back.

Outstanding ambiance. I've been twice so far and am really impressed with their stuffed snapper. It's really an original take on Moroccan fish. The meat was soft, tender and perfectly cooked. The skin was crispy and very flavorful. It comes with a number of sides that compliment the flavor. This dish is really heavy and would recommend sharing with up to 3 people.

I came for a work dinner and was seated in an upstairs area. Roomy, well lit and attentive. It was a perfect venue for a business dinner with time to chat. The plating is on fleek, food is beautifully presented and looks as good as it tastes. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients and took into consideration my group's dietary restrictions when making recommendations. Service was attentive, yet not pushy. The food tastes good, the flavor profiles are interesting and well executed.Eggplant - One of the more forgettable dishes. Strong balsamic vinegary taste, texture is tender while not suffering from the mushyness.Carrots - Sweet, slightly soft and well spiced.Duck Mousse - Light, airy texture like a cheesecake and smooth melt mouthfeel. Really good.Basteeya - Like a giant duck filled spring roll. Slightly sweet, tender pieces, flaky pastry.72 Hour Braised Short Rib - Very tender. Some pieces were gristly but getting a good piece was like eating a stick of meaty butter in a good way.

OVERALL: Amazing culinary experience here!  RESERVATIONS: Made a few weeks in advance online.  THE SERVICE: When they called to confirm the reservation, I asked for a booth, and they said they had some upstairs. I didn't realize the upstairs was a small, relatively plain room with a low ceiling, so we wouldn't get to experience the beautiful main dining room. They ended up seating us in a really weird long booth where the two on the ends would have been really far from each other. We asked for a normal table for conversation logistics, so we didn't even get a booth in the end! COCKTAILS* Curry + Cardamom ($14) - 4.5 starsLoved this! Kick of spice, kick of sweet, incredibly well-balanced, great texture. DINNER* Eggplant ($16) - 3.5 stars, not counting the flatbreadVery interesting - eggplant in 3 forms!  * Flatbread (part of Eggplant dish, $16) - 4 starsExcellent, soft (stretches when you pull it apart), warm, herby.  * Salmon ($22) - 3 starsNot very memorable, and I'm not the biggest fan of glazed salmon. The fish was quite soft.  LA'ACHA (Moroccan family style)* Lamb La'acha (serves 4, $140) - 4.5 starsIncredibly tender meat. Loved every single side, great variety.  DESSERT* Honey & Almond ($12) - 3.5 starsLovely, light. Wouldn't get this as the only dessert but pairs well. Bottom part is soupy. * Chocolate & Dukkah ($15) - 4 starsVery good for chocolate lovers; the chocolate is intense!

Wow! Thank you, Mourad, that was an incredible meal we had last night!I was never a big fan of the Moroccan food, but this was something else!The hight quality of each ingredient made every dish memorable!Probably the best octopus I ever had. Tender and melts in the mouth. Other additions that were on the plate simply made each bite a pleasure!My husband had basteeya, and was totally blown away by the taste of it.We ordered chicken(for two) for the main course. Incredible! The taste, the colors, the amazing side dishes that were served with it. Simply perfection!Sugar puffs were the perfect ending to a brilliant evening.Lady that great us at the door was happy and smiling and made us feel really welcomed. We had a lovely young waitress who was friendly and always smiling.Great wine list, great cocktails.Great evening, and no need to say, we couldn't leave this place without booking our next dinner here.See you in a couple of weeks, Mourad!

From the hostess to the food runners... everyone was so sweet and helpful. This is an upscale, Michelin star type of restaurant that knows how to treat people! They take their guests as serious as they take their craft. We had the octopus, a sashimi style salad and the short rib. Everything was perfection! I can't wait to go back and try the chicken. We loved this place! Oh and we went for our anniversary and they greeted us with a glass of champagne and our menus were printed with "happy anniversary" at the top.Lovely experience!

I see you Mourad, livin' it up to that that Michelin star. I loved everything about my dining experience here. Appetizers: Get the octopus! I wouldn't usually order octopus, but it's cooked to perfection at Mourad. The pieces of octopus are meaty and steak like. Not fishy at all, so don't be scared. I would also recommend their eggplant and flatbread. Their flatbread is probably the best I've had and it's fluffy - hardly anything flat about it.Drinks: They have great cocktails here. I had the clove + hibiscus (cognac, grapefruit, pineapple IPA etc.). Refreshing and wasn't overly strong. I'd also recommend the curry + cardamom. Food: My family shared the short ribs and chicken. Both are family style dishes and come with sides. It was enough to feed 6! Everything was tasty, but my favorite was the short ribs - the meat falls off the bone and you barely have to chew lol. The menu says it feeds four, but I'd come back just to share the short ribs with my boyfriend. My favorite sides were the potatoes and heirloom beans - that sauce is life. Dessert: Their sugar puffs (6 per order) were crispy and fluffy. Slightly reminiscent of a malasada. They come with a citrus and caramel sauce but would love these with a chocolate sauce.Service: Friendly and attentive service. Our server forgot to put a drink order in, which was no big deal, but was kind to take the drink off the tab. Not to mention the small details like pulling out chairs and folding your napkin when you step away from the table. Coming back for more Mourad in 2017!

We went there for our anniversary. Booked in advance we shown up about 10 minutes earlier and were seated immediately.As I booked in OpenTables specifying the occasion, we were greeted with complimentary glasses of a sparkling wine.Our waitress explained that Fixe Prix menu is a 2.5h adventure and as we were not particularly hungry we went with a usual menu.My wife ordered the Strawberry + Turmeric refresher and she loved it. I got whisky sour and it was good. They do offer a choice of ice, rocks or plain.For our stomachs we got Foie Gras, Basteeya and Chicken La'Acha. Basteeya was the best of all. Foie Gras is nicely served, but in my opinion there was something missing to balance its astringency. Chicken would serve 4 easily, but was rather plain: well grilled, but no extra sauce or spices. The flavor came from 4 sides which deserve to be ordered on their own. Our favorites were beans and couscous.The Berries & Cream dessert was a perfect finish. Rich and vivid, berries tasted almost like were picked from wild plants.We are looking forward for another occasion to try their Fixe Prix.

We came for NYE and greatly enjoyed the tasting menu with my boyfriend (I had to steal a photo from another yelper because I (gasp) forgot to take a photo!The course's were perfectly executed. He's been to Mourad a number of times when he's been in town for work- and he speaks to their overall consistency.My favourite was a toss up between the 40 day dry aged beef and the scallop with fois gras.Tasting menu was $190/person for 7 courses- which is pretty reasonable given the range and overall experience.

I made a reservation here not knowing it was a Michelin-star restaurant until I read the reviews a few days before I went. Whoops. Lol.Of course then, my expectations heightened but every one of them was met!We came for a 5:45 dinner reservation on a Saturday because...it was all we could get.The four of us had:Appetizers:OCTOPUS brussels sprouts . cauliflower . mustard . preserved lemon: delicious, cooked perfectly, good sauce but small portion.SCALLOP yam . quinoa . mushrooms . golden raisin . vadouvan: the scallops were large and juicy, the mushrooms were meaty, the vadouvan and raisins were the perfect accompaniment. It also came with a rice chip-esque thing we really liked. .LAMB lentil . rutabaga . maitake . eucalyptus . black lime: I didn't try it but the group liked it.Main course:SNAPPER red charmoula . mushroom with coucous, harissa kale, roasted potatoes and beans with feta-z'aatar foam on the side: the snapper was big but we needed it since the previous courses were small. We loved it! One of the guys said it was the best snapper he ever had. They do a great job deboning it so you can enjoy a whole fish without worrying about bones. Also, ALL of the sides were delicious! My favorite was the bean with feta-z'aatar but really, they were all good...possibly better than the snapper! Also, this was one of the larger and more reasonably priced (at $80) main courses. It's perfect for 4 and fills out the meal. .Dessert:STRAWBERRY |rhubarb . coriander . labneh.CHOCOLATE & DUKKAH |hazelnut . sesame . shisoBoth were good but the chocolate was the star..Cocktail:I forget the name of mine but it had smoked salt, Campari, banana liqueur: unique, delicious and interesting plating with the glass in a large bowl with beach notes.I forget the cocktails the rest of the group had but they were all unique and deliciousService was good. We were busy talking so they knew to not bother us too much. They still took care of us though. The restaurant itself is beautiful.Mourad is every bit the fine dining and Michelin star experience you hope for! Can't wait to come back!

Food is great, service is adequate and they can make the sides dairy free so they accommodate allergies. However, even though I have been to Mourad several times, I will not go back again. The three stars reflects the experience explained below. I booked a reservation last Friday night for a friend and I; I have not seen this friend in a while so we had a lot to catch up on. We had a good meal and were chatting still as the deserts and the check came. We paid our bill and were munching on the complementary cookies while my friend was telling me a story. I guess we were taking too long to leave. The manager came by, interrupted us and said he needed us to finish our conversation in the bar because he needed the table. Now, I can understand the need for the table. I also understand that we paid the bill and were still talking. I also understand that we may have needed a nudge to get going soon. However, I don't understand the blunt interruption and asking us to finish at a bar which was overflowing and no where to sit to finish our conversation. We went to the bar, no seats so we stood. We were bumped into several times by wait staff and had to finish our conversation by the bathroom. What should have happened? I will tell you. The manager should have come over to us, interrupted us nicely with a "sorry to interrupt", ask if he can get us anything else, then ask us if we would not mind finishing up our conversation in the bar where Mourad would give us two competently drinks and find us space to talk. I was at a local Mexican restaurant the next night; my table was not ready because the people sitting at it were taking longer than expected. I was offered complementary sangria and an appetizer while I waited and my meal was not 200 dollars, it was 50 bucks! Also, change your leftover process. Everyone forgets leftovers because you choose to leave the leftovers at the check in desk .. everyone I talk too forgets their leftovers. Just give them to us at the table. I seriously hope your feeding the homeless with all that food people forget.

Boy, do we miss Aziza. Sigh.Decades of Moroccan food made our experience with Mourad okay but not great. Why? Well, it's a lot Californian and not a lot Moroccan, and what was Moroccan was pretty muted down. Like our meal at Taj Campton Place, great for taking folks who are skittish about 'exotic cuisines', but a little disappointing for those of us who adored Aziza's creative and exciting fusion, especially when Louis Maldonado was working there.The octopus starter was tender, but tiny. Why so much sauce for 4 thin rounds? Lovely stuff, but only a single teaspoon measure was needed. The rest went to waste, which was a shame as it was beautifully conceived and executed, a mustard/salted Meyer combo.Lamb shoulder entree: At first we thought we had been brought a salad! Big ruffled red and green lettuce leaves hid thick slices of tender but very plain lamb. The large deep bowl also holds untoasted whole almonds, unpitted prunes sprinkled with white sesame seeds, and small rings of very sour white pickled onions. We love onions and love pickles, but not these. Discarding them, we ate about half the lamb and had it boxed up to go. The lamb is served with four sides and three dipping sauces:- Kale in orange juice. I just didn't think the flavors of bitter kale and sweet oj went together, but Spouse liked it so he finished it.- Roasted potatoes, marinated green grapes. An odd combination, but I liked this so I finished it. - Heirloom beans. This seemed a variant of a dish we had at Aziza back in 2009. Aziza's was a whole lot better. The beans had little sauce, were piled separately in the dish from a heap of dry toasted bread crumbs, and neither were very interesting together, unlike the way Aziza had combined them eight years prior.- Couscous. We have always held Mourad Lahlou's couscous (and flatbread) as incomparable. So we were disappointed to find we didn't like the new brown butter couscous as much. We weren't the only ones, our friends came here a week later and like us, they thought the old Aziza couscous was better.BUT....what brings this lamb up to four stars are the three sauces: cilantro-anchovy EVOO, pimento-olive, citrus-harissa. They are terrific, with the brilliant creativity we expect from Lahlou's kitchens. You'll find similar sauces all over town, but Lahlou's always have that extra touch of something simple yet unique, making perfectly balanced flavor pairings. If there's any doubt about what a great chef can do versus a talented chef, these three ramekins show how unexpected combinations of everyday ingredients can be turned into culinary magic by a chef with a gifted palate. Although pastry chef Melissa Chou has left to join Mr. Jiu's, her influence seems to have remained a bit, with the "Sugar Puffs" dessert. These are the Chinese egg puffs, sai yong. These were good, altho the center was soggy which we consider a minus. Dipping sauces were tasty.Strawberry labneh was lovely: sweet fruit and creamy yoghurt.Skip the Verve pour-over if you're a black coffee drinker like us. The 4-6 cup Chemex can just barely fill the two big tumblers they bring - and can we please say that handles are a really great new invention that should be used by every restaurant, especially for hot drinks? Yes, we thought you'd agree. Verve is meant for cream and sugar, so unsuitable unless you adulterate it.Mourad is Aziza's stylish, polished and shiny sibling. We're glad we came and we did enjoy our meal. But it's Aziza that has always shown soulfulness in its cooking, and that's something we didn't find at Mourad.

The whole Peking duck was so salty it tasted like it had been marinating in a chemical brine for a month. The kale was the consistency of mush -----like it had been boiling for 6 hours or so. The couscous was too soft and soaking in cheese.The service was hit and miss.The room is very pretty. The sound track is good.

Such an amazing meal. The service is incredible and classy, and the restaurant is beautiful. We started with the basteeya and the salmon. The basteeya has a flaky outside with a tender, flavorful meat filling. It's my favorite thing on the menu. We had the beef and the scallops for our main course, and they were both amazing. They come with sides of well seasoned vegetables and other delicious things. The desserts are great as well. The puffs with cinnamon are great to share, the chocolate is a great combination of chocolate and peanut butter with ice cream, and the rose froyo is slightly tart and sweet. Everything was wonderful!

We came here for our wedding anniversary. We had reservations at 8 but got seated at 8:20 because they wanted to make sure we got a cute table to help us celebrate our special day! Very thoughtful! We didn't try the tasting menu, because it takes 2-3 hours and 12 courses to complete. What we ordered was just so tasty and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.

Very much enjoyed my visit to Mourad for a wonderful dinner. The ambiance is fantastic. If you are seated in the upstairs seating area, you also get the pleasure of peeking through the glass window into the kitchen, and seeing the battalion of chefs prepping food. We started the evening with some cocktails, which were well balanced, complex and incorporated Moroccan / Middle Eastern ingredients. The fields of gold came slightly on the sweet side, while the Risk, Rebellion, Passion & Mystery delivered on its name. For appetizers, tried the foie gras, and the octopus. Both were presented beautifully. The foie gras was creamy, well balanced with sweetness of the gelatinous plum. The brussel sprouts were the stars of the Octopus dish. The Octopus itself was prepared to an average standard - I've had both a higher quality raw ingredient, as well as a better prep. For main course, shared the red snapper from the La'Acha menu. From a portion perspective, it definitely serves three comfortably. The presentation was pleasing to the eye, the sauces and stuffing were well balanced. I enjoyed the side of harissa, it was delicious and accompanied the flavors of the fish extremely well. The brown butter couscous, while a departure from tradition, was airy and perfectly cooked. Similar to the octopus, the only fault of the main was a red snapper that could have been of higher caliber, exposed when you flip the fish over and taste it without the sauce or filling. The service was as you would expect from a 1-Michelin restaurant, and it makes a nice difference in the dining experience. The wait-staff tableside manners were impeccable. Water was never allowed to run dry, finished dishes were promptly removed, and napkins were folded any time guests stepped away from the table. These small things made a huge difference in the overall dining experience.4 Stars given this is 1-Michelin, deduction for the slight faults in the Octopus and Snapper.

It's refreshing to see collaboration between the kitchen and bar since it seems to be the future of the culinary world. Mourad_sf blurs the lines between cocktail bar and restaurant to keep the focus on the overall guest experience... Their service is approachable and fun unlike other Michelin star restaurants who tend to be stuffy and over pretentious.

Mourad has some amazing food! I came across it on Utrip and decided I should try it. I am glad I decided to try it. I have never had Moroccan food before but this food set the bar high for future Moroccan meals. It was amazing! You could totally taste the love in the food. It was served fancy but I feel if I was to go to a Moroccan's house for dinner this is what I would get except the super fancy presentation. The decor of the restaurant was also spot on and lovely. Just a great night with great food. The staff was also amazing, very friendly. I called 5-10 minutes before my husband and I came and we were able to get reservations right then. Our waiters name was Victoria and she was super cool. Very knowledgeable of the menu and could answer any questions. She also let me meet the head chef and owner, Mourad. How freaking cool is that!! The cool thing is Chef Mourad is a celebrity chef who STILL cooks on the line. I thought that was amazing! Most chefs at his level don't cook a lot. Victoria said he is there just about every night. I love that!! My husband and I started our dinner with drinks. He ordered a class of wine and I ordered the Strawberry & Cardamon Refresher. He liked his wine. I really enjoyed this refresher. It was light and different. I also tried the Apple & Dandelion Refresher but did not like this one. In my opinion it tasted like warmed apple cider Vinegar. I sent that back and ordered another strawberry one. We then ordered appetizers. My husband ordered the Octopus and I ordered the Basteeya. The Octopus was ok. It lacked in seasoning. It was served with a sauce and fried Brussel Sprouts. Honestly, eating the Octopus with the Brussel Sprouts made it taste better. It wasn't horrible but I have had better. The Basteeya was very good! I have never had this before so it was different and I liked it. It was served with a sauce, a pear jam and some pears. Very tasty. Definitely try it. For the entree we ordered the Chicken from the LA'ACHA menu (Moroccan family style dining with all sides). When I say this had to be the prettiest chicken dish I have ever eaten.. OMG! I felt like the chicken just finished a photo shoot then was brought to the table. Gorgeous plating! The chicken was amazing!! It had taste and was super tender. It was also served with three sauces that accompanied the chicken well. Very very good! They definitely took basic chicken and developed the flavors well. It was served with beans, braised Kale, potatoes, and CousCous. All the sides were amazing as well. Each one had its own little flavor. The Kale was very good, it had a sweet bite to it. The beans were awesome! It comes with some things on top to give them the perfect flavor. As a whole this dish was awesome! We didn't get dessert as we were stuffed but Victoria brought us out some chocolate cookies that had pepper specks on top. These cookies were amazing and the perfect size! Overall, I would suggest Mourad to anyone. Our entire dining experience was amazing. Besides a few small things everything was wonderful. Great great food!! Definitely try!!

My experience here was marred by the fact the bartender had us move seats so they could accommodate more people at the bar. It's not that I don't understand - I do. I just don't understand why our service then after was poorer than the people who we moved for. Was it because they were better dressed? Was it because we looked younger? Whatever the case may be, I was dissatisfied afterwards. There was barely even a thank you for moving. Then our dishes were almost given to the wrong person since we had moved seats. You'd think they would be able to deal with that issue with no blimps in service, but I could definitely tell the servers were also thrown off on the change in seats. Other than the service, the food was great! My friend and I came since we both had a few bad weeks at work and just needed a treat. I started off with the duck liver and my friend got the octopus - both really good. Beautifully presented and definitely recommend (if you decide to go). As for the mains, my friend got the lamb which was nice and tender, and I got the scallops which was great. For dessert, we ended with Honey and almond and the carrot. Both were not...super satisfying as a dessert. I'd just skip instead. Because I had a bad experience there, I have no desire going back. Protip: if you're going, the food's good, but service...average at best.

It was my 5th time eating there and Mourad doesn't disappoint.We ordered the 72 hour braised short ribs and the lamb shoulder "la'acha" (Moroccan family style dining served with sides and sauce) for 8 people.There was so much meat that we couldn't finish it all!It was my first time trying the lamb, it goes quite well with the prunes. The beed is still my all time favorite though, it's so tender that it just melts in your mouth.

The boyfriend brought me here and I thoroughly loved it!Food and service was phenomenal! We ordered the duck to share, and while it says it'll 2-3 people, it's definitely 3. It took 35 minutes to cook so we were super hungry when it arrived and still had to pack a lot up to go.Only downside is their desserts all have dairy in it. Because I'm on a strict no dairy diet, I didn't get to try anything. Maybe next time their menu will be different!

Mourad is bold. And elegant. And maybe a little gaudy at times... but I liked it.I started with the Reaping Reward cocktail: Fresh grapefuit + mezcal drink. The kumquat marmalade served on the side with cinnamon was lovely but I didn't add it to the drink since I found it to be perfectly balanced already. Highly recommend this cocktail.Foie gras + plum with semolina cake: B-e-a-utiful presentation. Decadent dish as one would expect, and so so tasty. If ya wanna indulge, do it with this dish.Kanpachi: The smoked fish gelee (savory jelly) was incredible. Topped with the kanpachi and avocado... mmm mm mm! Must try.Salmon: Another beautiful presentation. I found this fish to be perfectly cooked with a strong smoky flavor. The grapefruit foam was powerful, and the olive 'n fennel was a nice addition.Duck basteeya: Super heavy. The photos looked as though this would be a small plate (something like an eggroll size) but be warned -- this is more of a burrito size. Tasty, but I could only have a couple of bites. The creme fraiche served with it was killer.Lamb: The lamb on it's own was perfectly done. Getting into the other aspects of the dish, things start to get wild. The rutabaga, lentils, and mushrooms were so bold I wasn't entirely sure why they were paired with this perfectly done lamb. I felt the additional components took away from letting the lamb shine, but each on their own were incredibly flavorful and fun to try.This was a little too much food for two, but we managed :) Overall, the food was great as was the service. +1 for the music selection as well!

Seriously one of the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco! I was invited by a friend to dine here and I was a bit skeptical as i am not too into Michelin rated restaurants or what not. First of, the restaurant is beautiful, I love the design! We started with Toast, Spreads, Olives and Pecans all of which were delicious although the pecans were a bit spicy for my taste. The bread that came with the spreads is a must try and the toast was my favourite dish! For our main course we ordered the duck, salmon and chicken-- again all of which were good. The chicken was so tender and tasty I couldn't believe it was made out of chicken breast they even managed to change the taste of carrots. I highly recommend trying this restaurant and ordering the olives, toast and chicken. Great food, great ambience and awesome service! Can't wait to go back! TIP: make a reservation especially if you plan to go for dinner

Mourad was easily the best food I ever ate in San Francisco (and I pride myself on having eaten my way through the city in the year that I lived there - both cheap eats and Michelin-starred). I never really felt the need to review any of the other places. My boyfriend and I came here for a special occasion at the end of March after I had heard good things.We had the salmon and the octopus to start - while the octopus was tasty with a nice flavor, it was no where near as impressive as the salmon, which was melt in your mouth. There was just something about that fennel and blood orange blend. My boyfriend could not stop raving about it after we had finished it and even thought about getting a second order. At least until our entree arrived. We decided to share the duck roulade la'acha. The waiter had said that we would be decently satisfied with the portion sizes (the menu said it fed two), but considering the order also came with ALL of the sides, we were completely stuffed. The duck was incredibly flavorful and had a nice smokiness. It was also incredibly juicy. Of the four sides we got, I remember enjoying the potatoes the best (crispy!) as well as the cannellini beans.Mourad was an absolutely fabulous dining experience. Yes, a bit pricey (kind of expected with the Michelin star), but completely worthwhile. I will happily be back when I'm back in the city and I'm also looking forward to trying Aziza (sister restaurant run by Mourad Lahlou) when it re-opens.

Had an excellent dinner where every dish was perfectly cooked and well seasoned! You'll enjoy some special flavors, unique in the San Francisco formal restaurant scene. Food: 5/5We tried the eggplant and carrot appetizers. Both were deliciously flavored and refreshing. For entrees our table had the couscous and the branzino. Both were delicious! The branzino especially was cooked perfectly and fell apart under the fork. The only downside was the honey and almond dessert, which I felt missed the mark a bit - prioritizing what the waiter called "an experience in textures" above good old fashioned flavor. The sugar puffs by far made up for it! Overall an excellent meal!Ambiance: 5/5 Beautiful restaurant and a gorgeous open kitchen (behind glass) where you can watch them work. Service: 5/5Very professional and well paced, although the water refillers were a bit too eager for my taste. Nothing to complain about though and it did not detract from the experience.

Came here on a Friday after work (with reservations). The restaurant didn't seem packed so I imagine without reservations there wouldn't be much of a wait or if anything 15-20 minutes. I loved the high ceilings of this place (but really, who doesn't?) and seating was very comfortable.There were 3 of us, but we were pretty set on ordering the 72 hour braised short ribs that the menu recommends is for 4 people. Since we knew we were doing the short ribs, we skipped on any other dishes and appetizers - and good thing we did! The short ribs came with 4 side dishes of its own and we were more than satisfied by the end of the meal. The short ribs literally melted in our mouths and tasted so fresh and amazing. Would highly recommend ordering it - even if there's only 3 of you ;)As for the sides that the dish came with - there were potatoes (so good and served with sauce on top), heirloom beans (I'm not a fan of beans so I avoided this), cous cous (a good complement to the ribs), and some sauteed kale. My favorites out of these four would definitely be the potatoes and then the cous cous.Even after being stuffed, we were feeling ambitious and ordered 2 desserts - chocolate and almond & honey. Nothing spectacular about these, but the chocolate dessert did have a bit of a smoke show to it.

Had reservations to celebrate our anniversary at Mourad, hoping it would evoke nostalgia of our honeymoon in Morocco. Meh... not so much. Several things about our experience left my partner and I disappointed.First, when we asked the server if the menu items listed under "la'acha" (which we learned translates to "feast") would be similar to a tajine (the dish we had the most of on our honeymoon), he pulled a KellyAnne Conway and batted around the question without actually answering it. Seemed like he wasn't familiar with tajines, which I don't quite get because the savory stew is a Moroccan staple.Second, I would describe the general air of the service we got as cold and non-attentive: 1) Several people, including our main server, came by our table now and then, but they were usually stand-offish and impersonal in the way you'd expect at an old-school, stuffy restaurant. 2) One of the folks bussing our table gave me a drink menu halfway through the meal so that I could order a second cocktail. But by the time our server finally returned to check on us, we had finished our main course and I was no longer in the mood for another drink. 3) A couple of times, our dishes were taken away from us when we weren't even finished eating from them! Ugh. At least ask. 4) We had lots of leftovers from our duck la'acha, so our server agreed to pack it up for us to go. When we got home, we realized that he definitely never returned our leftovers to us. He must have forgotten. Finally, overall, we thought the food was pretty mediocre. Nothing was terrible, but few things were awesome. The exceptions were the appetizer olives (seasoned with preserved lemon and almonds) and the honey/almond dessert, both of which were quite delicious. However, they outshone the entrees by far. We're fans of Aziza, so we were hoping to love Mourad. That just wasn't the case. Also, this place ain't cheap. So we were really expecting something better. Maybe 2.5 stars would be more accurate to give, but 3 definitely feels like too many.(I just remembered... the tiles on the walls of the co-ed bathroom stalls made me scream "MOROCCO!" Bathroom selfies ensued. I guess that's a plus!)

How Mourad is a one star Michelin star restaurant is beyond me. This is surprising because I have heard great things about the chef! Maybe this was just an off-night. Pros:- Beautiful atmosphere - Good Service- Nice food presentationCons:- Taste wasn't great- Price pointI'll start with Pros. The place is gorgeous, hats off to the interior decorator that did this place. It's great for a drink with colleagues after work or a romantic dinner date for two. The restaurant is big, open, and spacious. It isn't too loud, but isn't too quiet -- the atmosphere is just right. The service is good too. Staff was very friendly, prompt, and helped create a positive experience. We had reservations and were seated right away. Our waitress was nice explained the menu to us, and gave us a solid appetizer recommendation. Plus points for all these.Cons:- We were underwhelmed by our food! We got the duck basteeya and spiced nuts to start, this was probably our favorite dishes of the night and went downhill from there. For entrees, we ordered scallops, lamb, and the main couscous. The scallops were rubbery, not seared; the lamb was chewy and bland; and the couscous was pretty basic for being an entree. Each dish is ~$40 and up, and at this price point, I expect the cooking and flavors to be spot on.

VERY FANCYPANTS. We came here for my cousin's birthday dinner. I was wearing sneakers, which is absolutely hilarious in retrospect. STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN.We shared about a million things. First of all, they charge $2 per extra flatbread - lol ok. Secondly, the Moroccan mint tea is TO DIE FOR. Okay, I'm going to stop numbering my sentences. We had, as appetizers, the kanpachi, salmon (highlight), duck liver (did not eat, as I DO NOT EAT LIVER and am very non-adventurous in my food choices and I like it that way), and eggplant (my favorite of the appetizers). We also ordered two entrees, the lamb and the beef, which I did not try, as I am a non-red-meat-eating omnivore and if loving ewe is wrong, I don't want to be right. As we were a party of 6, we went ahead and ordered the family-style snapper, which came with all the sides - it went SO WELL with the couscous. The fish was cooked to perfection, super tasty and all that jazz. The side of kale was underwhelming and didn't quite go with its accompanying olives, the potatoes were just fine, and the heirloom beans were SO GOOD - a definite highlight.If you get dessert, go for the chocolate one - it was amazing. And at the mention of my cousin's birthday, they gave us a free carrot cake dessert thingy with a Happy Birthday message and a single candle. So sweet.We were taken care of by about a million team members - our main server was a very kind blond lady. There was a guy there who gave me an obnoxious look as I came out of the bathroom and later tried to mansplain something to me. I didn't care for him. And another dude, when I asked him if there was green tea in the mint tea, said "it's a Moroccan thing." I'm sensitive to caffeine, so I Googled it, and yes, fun fact: Moroccan mint tea is comprised of green tea (so the answer was yes, no thanks to that dude), mint leaves, sugar, and boiled water. Yumtown, population however many people are drinking it. Bottom line: men, how about you do your jobs; women, you're amazing and you deserve a raise! Oh, and the food was great.Peace out

Last Friday ( March,31 ) my husband and I decided to go to the Mourad for the first time to celebrate my birthday. I fought the place online and decided to try it. The location is good. The place by itself is nice! They did a great job on decoration and that is it! The food was okay for me ( but my husband didn't like it ). And the service... was just terrible! They have many waiters and they were everywhere but at the same time anywhere! I only that one glass of wine because the waiter took forever for check on us! When he finally showed up my husband and I were already over of that place! We even stayed to try the dessert.We are definitely not going back and I would not recommend it to anyone.

The basteeya appetizer was incredible. We also had olives and the eggplant/flatbread appetizer, which were also solid. For dinner, we had the short rib laacha. Though it is normally served for 4, they accommodated us by serving a half order for 2. The short ribs were served with 3 sauces and potatoes, beans, kale, and couscous for sides. The meat and sides were all excellent. We were seated next to a one-way window into the kitchen, and it was a fascinating experience to watch Chef Mourad and his kitchen at work. All in all, highly recommend!

You can't ask for a greater venue, not only is this restaurant situated on the bottom floor of the historic Pac Bell/140 New Montgomery building, but the space itself is breathtaking: high ceilings, giant slab of tree roots greeting you at the door, swanky wine loft, and bar counter running along the front of the building. Great for professional lunch meetings, classy music playing in the background, and tables spaced far enough apart to allow conversational privacy without feeling disconnected from the general public. Service is always beyond top notch, staff are consistently friendly and accommodating, and will patiently explain each dish in detail to new guests. Astounding food presentation! Ingredients couldn't be fresher or more colorful. My go to for lunch is the basteeya: shredded duck in crispy outer layers, with sides of aprium and creme fraiche. Super lean, never greasy, and very hearty. The avocado toast, albacore, grapefruit, and cress is a great starter. The flavors really come together well. I am highly impressed with the freshness of the ingredients, and how the phenomenal flavor profiles. A simple starter like olives, when combined with lemon zest, oil, and marash, are truly delicious. The "flat bread" with spreads is also a great starter: fluffy round English-muffin-shaped seasoned breads hot out of the oven served up with a medley of spreads. The menu changes out here and there every few months so definitely make sure to check back for new items from time to time. If you're into a bit of spice with your craft beer, wine, or cocktails, the harissa nuts (whether almonds or pecans) are a great option, and you get a generous portion to share amongst the table.One of the most enjoyable dining experiences in the SF FiDi/SoMa area, and you simply can't order anything wrong on the menu.

Mourad is fancier than my typical Friday night dinner, but a friend was celebrating his birthday here so I came along for the ride. I was really impressed by the food and ambiance in this restaurant - sometimes, I guess you get what you pay for!Dishes were served family style - everything was delicious, but the highlight for me was the short rib. Flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth good. My favorite appetizer was the soft warm bread paired with eggplant-tomato spread, and the desserts ("sugar puffs," basically a high-end donut) were also very yummy.
