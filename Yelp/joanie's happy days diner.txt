This is probably the worst place to get breakfast, especially after you see 4 stars, expect 4 star quality food, and end up getting .5 star food. I order the breakfast burrito with bacon and my husband ordered the typical American breakfast, eggs, hash browns, toast and a hamburger patty. My burrito was meh...like how can you mess up a breakfast burrito?! My eggs were dry and super over cooked, and I noticed that they used whole American cheese slices. YUCK! The best part was the tortilla! My husband's food was such bad quality, we had to send it back! His burger patty was obviously a frozen party and tasted horrible. His sunny side up eggs were dry and pathetic. The best part was the young man that served us! Very friendly, super helpful! Needless to say, we WILL NOT be coming back.

Good for a quick breakfast, very casual, a small diner with limited outside seating. It seems like a family business with all the family working together. The service we good and efficient. I ordered eggs Benedict and it was cooked very nicely, however I feel like many places usually offer a toast or a pancake with the main entree but this place just had the dish!

So this small little diner is fantastic. Only about 15 tables in the whole place with 3 people running around taking care of everyone. Every server helps the other, so you are hardly lacking for care. The food portions are very big and so tasty. I got the fat crab eggs benedict. Dungeness crab and spinach should not work on eggs benedict but it did and was amazing. We are going back tomorrow before we leave. Just awesome all around.

Visiting SF to see a Giants game. Came here for breakfast. Food was good. Not your traditional breakfast place. Menu items are a little different which was refreshing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because seating is a little cramped at tables and my ice tea tasted like it was poured from a bottle. But, I would go here again!

We had breakfast here and it was awesome!! There was a wait next door, so we popped in here and got a table right away. So glad we did. My fiance and I both had the breakfast tacos, they were phenomenal! Generous portions of avocado, fresh ingredients, they were great. Both of our kids meals were wonderful too! Super happy we happened upon this little spot, it was great!!!

So I had bookmarked Eight am. After our run nearby I was excited to go here. Unfortunately the wait was 30 mins and we were starving. My sister saw Joanie's right next door. She said it didn't have bad reviews. It didn't look inviting at all lol. I was so bummed. I thought it would be like Denny's if not worse. Looks can be deceiving. And I was definitely proven wrong. I'm so excited as I'm writing this. Honestly that was probably the best eggs Benedict I've had. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Whites were not runny. The hollandaise sauce had great flavor. I asked for a side of bacon. I got like 6 slices of crispy yummy bacon. (My stomachs growling:). Not greasy at all. The only complaint is that I asked for spinach in my eggs Benedict. I think they forgot. The service was fast. And the food had great taste and quality. I'm so glad we came here.

Where is the negative stars box? This place was a disaster. It looked good from the outside because it was full, food on other people's tables seemed nice, worth a try. The waiter forgot our drinks, then 20 minutes later checked on us and had us wait another 10 before bringing them. When we finally got our food, my eggs were raw, I had specifically asked for poached medium, the potatoes were cold-not warm-cold, there was a hair on my plate, and 1 mushroom under a poached eggs of my Benedict. Where was that from and why was it hiding under 1 of my eggs? The waiter told my husband that the toaster was broken, and that he could bring him some cold bread. What? And again why? We overheard that the credit card machine was not working, and hadn't noticed the whole restaurant sitting in the dark because we sat by the window, until the rest of the patrons cheered when the lights, ac, and electricity came on. (By the way, SF is experiencing usually hot weather, ugh) (explains why the toaster and cc machine weren't working). I've never wanted to run so fast in my life, but since we are traveling, I just wanted to eat and be on my way, but the whole situation was FUCKING NAUSEATING. This is my first bad yelp review. It totally deserved it. I will say that after I pointed out that there was no way I could eat what was on the dirty plate in front of me, they took off my disaster of a dish from the bill. Sketchy as all get up. I should have hit the road and grabbed In and Out. Lesson learned.

Very solid American breakfast joint. NEVER disappoints!I love this place for the quick and friendly services, reasonably priced dishes in Fisherman's Wharf, and the consistent presentation of food.I usually order the corned beef hash Benedict with country style potatoes. Everything about the Benedict is PERFECT. The potatoes are very fresh and I love the flavor from the green onions.I also like to order the pancakes, which are perfectly fluffy and goes well with the BOTTOMLESS bold coffee. :)

We never got to eat here. The food looked meh. I went in to get a table and I was told there was a wait. There were a couple of people that were waiting outside, but there were a ton of empty tables that had not been cleaned off yet.The woman brashly told me to write my name down, so I did. Once back outside, more tables cleared and yet no one was cleaning up the tables. One group which left told the group in front of us that they weren't served or even offered drinks in the 2 times they had been there during their stay.What breakfast joint doesn't offer coffee the moment you sit down? No place that I want to eat. We went down a couple doors to Eight AM and had an amazing meal.

The manager was quick to make us us pay for the beverages that we did not drink nor enjoy. Since the beverages and service were this bad I'm glad we didn't try the food and be dissatisfied any further. We threw $10 on the table and left.

Since when are dogs allowed inside restaurants??? I wouldn't have eaten here if I would have saw that before I ordered. There's a Pomeranian that belongs to the owners just chilling in the dining room. So they pet him then make my food. Then, I ordered a mimosa, they don't have any champagne. So she tells me she'll take it off my bill. Oh, really?? That's so generous considering people don't usually pay for things you don't have. They have the front door propped open, it's raining hard so it's cold and flies are coming inside. At this point I'm really worried about the quality of food.I got the fat crab and eggs instead of the crab bennies since it wasn't fried. Thankfully the food was fresh but the crab portion was small and I had to pull crab shell out of my mouth 3 times. There was double the amount of cooked spinach as there was crab and the English muffin was super soggy. The potatoes were ok and had lots of chives.I picked this place because I typed in "best breakfast near me" on yelp and this came up as number 2!!! What?? I will try Hollywood cafe tomorrow. I only gave 2 stars because I didn't get sick off the food. And all this (see photo) for a mere $25. You have got to be kidding me.

Was on the way to segway tours on 333 jefferson st nearby and this was quick and extremely accommodating! We ordered our breakfast and did not have to wait long - good thing we beat the rush as a line formed behind us.Coffee was enjoyable and so were the French Toast and pancakes. Syrup is a tad runny and sausages were decent. If you're looking for something reasonably priced and a large selection of food - with a decent wait and fast service come here for your meal! They'll be ready to serve you.

Found this place on Yelp, thank you Yelp! Located right across from our hotel. It was perfect for us. We came in at 7am and got seated right away, the food had generous portions and the family enjoyed their breakfast. I entree could feed 2 people. I got the Hobo scramble with ham, onions, bell pepper and cheese. Very good. Always get extra crispy hash browns, it tastes better. The hash brown portions are ridiculous. The staff is friendly and we for refills frequently. For our group of 6, they added the tip to the total, which was fine, but just be aware. Tip was $15 for breakfast. Filling meal to help start our day in San Francisco.

What I ate: Biscuits and gravy!Visit date: October 6, 2012First time? YesI was bit skeptical of this place being that it's in tourist country and all, but it wasn't so bad. When biscuits and gravy are on the menu, I'm there! The biscuits were nice and moist, and the gravy was filled with salty sausage bits! Mmm. I'm not sure why, but the biscuits and gravy come with toast. I wouldn't boast too much about the food, but the service was excellent! From the greeter out front to the servers, every worker was accommodating, friendly, and welcoming. At the end of our meal, we almost felt like guests in their home.

When we visited in August 2013, we ate breakfast here every day. We were referred by our hotel so we received a ginormous strawberry waffle for free. Food was perfect. Outdoor seating was great too. (There are only two or three tables, but it makes for a nice environment if you can snatch one.)Over the course of three days, the four of us tried the bagels, eggs, and everything in between. Would recommend anything on their menu. Two years later and I can still remember that the chai tea was exactly to my liking and I could not have asked for anything more.

* Stopped in here recently for breakfast on the way out of town, and it was nice! I would recommend it.* Food was good! Normal breakfast/lunch diner fare, prepared well and quickly. There are also some good vegetarian options on the menu, which I love. I got the veggie scramble with their breakfast potatoes which were AWESOME.* Everyone working there was super attentive and friendly!* Very reasonable prices for the (generally expensive) area it's in.* This is a small place (I'd estimate maybe 15 tables and bar seating? Not 100% sure.) and it's not fancy or anything, but it's clean, bright, and well-kept! I really liked the plain, casual diner atmosphere and felt comfortable (despite the fact that I was eating there alone!).* Great location near the wharf. Totally safe, touristy area. There is convenient nearby street parking and several public lots in the area.

The service here was good, the people were very nice and the food arrived quickly. And the coffee wasn't bad either.The food... I wish we had gone down the street to Denny's. Ok they eggs were cooked well, but out of 5 meals that was the only thing. May have been the worse pancakes both my daughter and I ever had. My son who eats EVERYTHING absolutely hated the corned beef hash.I would never give a bad review based of one visit if so many things were not so bad.
