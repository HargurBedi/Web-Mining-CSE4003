Found this small Italian bistro while walking down Columbus Avenue with my roommate. He got in to grab a bite of pizza and an something caught my attention while casually browsing the menu. They appeared to have a dessert I used to love when growing up as a kid in Rome. It's a Lemon Sorbetto stuffed in a real lemon shell. The owner said he gets it delivered directly from Italy.Since then I'm often at this place just to get my Sorbetto. I love the place.

Wow... I used to think there wasn't room for more pizza in North Beach. After having a most delicious lunch at Piccolo Forno, it feels like a North Beach staple that has been there all along. The food was remarkably flavorful, with the pasta and crust tasting like it was made that morning. Try the gnocchi!The owner, Giuseppe, is one the most genuine people you'll meet and he takes great pride in this place that he opened with his own sweat and equity. Wonderful spot all around!

This place was very good! Our friends stopped by to get pizza and the very next day, we were trying to figure out what to eat near Pier 39 area and decided to walk over to here (which is farther from there than expected but it was fine). They give you bread when you sit down which is nice--load up on those carbs! We each ordered a pizza for ourselves and a couple people took some other stuff like the burratta appetizer (so bomb) and amongst our table, people got the Prociutto Crudo, Vegetariana, Tonno & Cipolla, Lasanga, 4 Frommaggi, and a bunch of the antipasti.. I took the Cappriciosa which was good! But I gave the egg away to someone accidentally :( The artichokes were a little overpowering but overall the dish was really good--flavorful, fresh, and great cheese! I was a fan!Would come back and probably get the gnocchi and some of the other pizzas my table got, all of which looked tasty! Highly recommend if you're in the area

Mamma Mia! Such a great local establishment in the beautiful North Beach. :)It's genuine Italian, and though they don't serve alcohol, it's BYOB without a corkage fee. :) Many non-sketchy corner stores around this adorable area to pick up a last-minute bottle of wine.We ordered the gnocchi and a pizza- both delicious. I've had their assorted veggies of the day in previous trips here, and they are even better than the menu dishes.The staff are so friendly and food is so good and well-priced- can't beat it. Deserves its great rating. :)

This place came highly recommended by our AirBnB hosts, who knew we were traveling with 2 elementary school -aged kids.BYOD, no cork fees!!! (Liquor store 2 blocks away).Amazing Italian food made by real Italians :))). Ordered a large pasta and meatballs entree for the kids to split. It came with meat ragout sauce and meatballs. Kids polished it off in seconds and fought for leftovers.We had a few appetizers and a pizza, ate everything to the last crumb! Will be back for sure

Delicious, authentic pasta! We started with burrata, which was super creamy and came with a great prosciutto. Rustic homemade bread with high quality olive oil was complementary. My husband had the sea bass ravioli that was on special and I had the ricotta gnocchi. The gnocchi may be the best I ever had. Definitely top three....and my mom is italian so that is saying a lot. The service was top notch and they also have BYOW, at no corking fee.

I ordered some dishes to go and the owner was nice and the dishes were surprisingly tasty! I ordered the meat tortellini with meat sauce- LOVED this dish and wish it was on the regular menu. It was hand made and the meat sauce was really tasty. They even shredded some nice cheese on top which I appreciated because it was a take out order (they could have skimped on this).I also ordered a margherita pizza which I thought was just OK. But the fresh bread that came with the meal was great- fresh out of the oven, warm soft and chewy middle with a crusty exterior, perfect with some good butter!

This place has the best ravioli. The owner is from Amalfi coast, Capri. Very authentic ravioli. Totally worth your money. We had the butternut squash ravioli and the asparagus. The owner is so kind and almost personalizes the food depending on what you like. He is very open to different kinds of orders. Do try the ravioli and ask him to suggest because these raviolis were out of the world

We loved this place, felt so authentic, probably family owned, everything was fantastic from the appetizer to the dessert. I don't remember the exact name of the dishes (they need a website, desperately) but we had, appetizer: the bread with mozzarella and anchovies sauce (it was AMAZING, a must). The Pizza Pugliese and the Tortellini ai 3 formaggi as entrees. And Profiterole and Mocha for dessert. Everything was really good, you have to try this place. 100% recommended.

We went here on Sunday afternoon and ordered the lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs and spaghetti carbonara. The lasagna was great. The noodles you can tell are homemade because they're soft and thin and the sauce is just right, not too tangy.The spaghetti and meatballs was alright. The pasta was perfect but it was drowning in sauce and I personally don't like that much sauce. The sauce was also too tangy for my taste. The meatballs were good though.My sister had the spaghetti carbonara and she didn't like it at all. It had a bad aftertaste and had curdled eggs. She's had carbonara at Buca di Beppo and loved it and even made it herself and it was better then this.The service was pretty good. The bread they gave us was nothing like the bread in previous yelp posts. It was really small and hard not a big soft loaf like in the pics. After the 2nd bread refill I think he stopped checking on our table so he wouldn't have to refill our bread again. LolOverall it's pretty good. Just order the lasagna and you'll be fine.

Simple and positive review for this place. Good food that was authentic, fresh as delicious. Spot was awesome location with a great seat/table right next to the window. Menu was large and full of many great and diverse choices. Only thing holding back a five star was the waiter was overworked, serving all 8 tables at once. The man in the back making salads and pizzas was not as busy and could have helped alleviate the business of the dinner rush. He did after an hour at the end of the meal. Also, there were two tables that got a free dessert at the end of their meal for waiting a little longer for their meal. We waited as well but did not get a free dessert. Not sure why. Maybe noticeably non-locals?Either way, I would go back definitely as the food and spot was fresh, delicious and authentic Italian.

Really, really nice place for lunch on Columbus. The service could not have been friendlier, (wisely) treating my two kids as any other customers. I wasn't sure who was happier to get to speak Italian: the waitstaff or my kids, who had been to Italy for a few weeks and missed the food and culture. The pizzas are all excellent, as is the Burrata w/Prosciutto appetizer. I'll definitely be back here, and not only for family time.

Simple Italian comfort food, relaxing chill ambiance, and very friendly staff! Affordable yummy pastas. Came for lunch on a Sunday around noon and it was pretty empty. My friend and I were wondering where all the people were since this place has a Yelp rating of 4.5We decided to order lasagna and spaghetti carbonara. It was a really nice day and the restaurant had the front door open which let the breeze and warmth of the sun in. Ah...felt great to be sitting right near the door. By 12:30pm, the place was filled with people, and majority of them were Italians! All seemed to be speaking Italian with the restaurant staff (most likely owner?). Our pastas were simple but perfectly cooked. each plate was around $15. We ended the meal with tiramisu - omg sooooo good. We gobbled that up in a second and licked every bit of it off the plate. Will be back to try more pastas!

I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo to-go and waited outside for 15-20 minutes which was understandable since it was very packed and busy. The fettuccine was perfectly cooked with the right amount of white sauce and chicken. They also gave me bread on the side but it was too hard to chew. Reasonable price and one of the employee ran to give me my order since he saw me walking away. I would return to this place again.

I always thought authentic Italian pizza would taste bland because of how simple it looked, I was DEAD WRONG. This place truly brings out the flavors in each of its ingredients, a pizza margherita tastes more than just "cheese, basil, and crushed tomatoes" I don't know how to describe it other than the flavors run deeper than most simple pizzas I have ever eaten. The owner of the place is incredibly friendly and engaging with his costumers, he actually lured me in when I was just passing by, and I'm glad he did.I will be back whenever I visit SF!

Here's a place so authentic, you feel as though you were casually dining on a side street off some quiet Roman piazza. It was intimate yet at the same time lively with conversations from other tables in Italian. One small child at the table next to ours was quite indecisive about his seat and meal, but overall pleasant and mannered. It simply added to the comfortable and laid back atmosphere. Giuseppe was an amazing host.

So came to the Chinatown Moon Festival event and wanted something to eat. Chinatown was packed with people and kind of wanted something different, so decided for Italian. So went to Yelp and was looking for something for a high rating, found Italian Homemade Company and this place which was right across the street. So it was going to be one or the other.I went to Italian Homemade Company and seen as I stated in their rating all they had were stools inside, meaning not kid friendly. The table and chair option was only outside, didn't want to sit outside and smell the people walking by.So I came here and ordered the special of the day and my partner ordered a classic dish. We were given some fresh baked bread with some olive oil, would had like some balsamic vinegar too but didn't have. When the plates came I thought it was off the kids menu, until I thought about it. They didn't have a kid menu, and if they did how small would be the portions if the adult portion was already kid size. So the staff already noticed we were happy with the portions and asked if liked more bread. Of course we did, but the bread the second time around was stale. Most likely day old bread not even reheated. The pasta was good, nothing special other than the small size considering the price.

Piccolo Forno gets me excited about the future of North Beach eateries. Located a couple of blocks down Columbus from the cluster of carbon copy tourist tarps, Piccolo Forno (along with The Italian Homemade Company) offers a simple and relaxed - yet contemporary approach to Italian dining. Open and clean interior gives off a relaxed vibe. No stuffy and fussy service but rather a straightforward and personable approach to hospitality. The same applies to the menu. Pizza slices, calzones, and pasta dishes along with a variety of antipasti and salads. The namesake Piccolo Forno pizza is almost a take on a niscoise salad in a pie. You won't even miss the fact that there isn't cheese on it with the nice combination of flavor between the tuna, artichoke, olives, tomatoes, and egg - it's very tasty. I can't wait to come back to try more of the menu. Piccolo Forno is a casual Italian eatery with quality food at affordable prices - a departure from places up the street but definitely a win for the neighborhood.

I went to Piccolo Forno with a group of 6. No beer or wine, but you can bring your own with no corkage. I ordered the salsicce and mushroom pizza. It was one of the worst pizzas I have ever eaten. The sausage had no taste exploding in my mouth when I bit into it and the cheese congealed and was hard. The crust tasted like cardboard. They also cut the pizza before serving it to me which I hate. Yes, I ate the pizza because I was hungry, but I didn't like it. When the bill came, we figured it came to $26.00 per person with tip. Three of us paid by credit cards and asked to be charged $26.00. They brought it back with a charge of $27 something. We asked why and they said something like they had to put down what we ordered, bla bla. They are all very nice and it's a lively place, but I will never go back.

Bravo Piccolo Forno! I've come here about 2 times in the past two months, because it's my boss's favorite place near work. I have to say, I was not disappointed in the least! The first time we went, I had the Crab Ravioli in Salsa Rosa, and it was absolutely wonderful. The second time, I had Cheese and Spinach Ravioli in a olive oil and parmiggiano dressing. As you can tell, I'm a softy when it comes to Ravioli... Both dishes were so simple yet so satisfying! We ended both meals with a homemade Tiramisu (my favorite) and a shot of espresso!Mille Grazie for the great service and even better food!

I see people poke their head in and keep on walking and I want to tell them "hey, hey, stop, this is the best spot you'll find" but I'm always too busy stuffing my face with pizza - this is the kinda place where I order pizza and then pasta. Carbo load but this place makes it worth it. So the food is great but so is the owner who makes it a habit to say hello and welcome you. I don't know of any other restaurants like that, do you? If so I want to hear about them, that's where I want to be putting my money.On to what to eat. I start with a slice of the vegetarian pizza and then do the butternut squash ravioli - it's literally the best I've ever had. I'm a meat lover but I go veg when I come here.

We split the spinach and cheese ravioli with beef ragu and the calzone with ricotta and some kind of meat (I forget -- too many beers at the Giants game earlier). Both were so good. The calzone was a surprise hit for sure, and they serve it with spicy olive oil. YUMMMMM. Come here hungry and leave feeling full plus slightly drunk. Win-win in my book.

Chanced on this place, given strong yelp reviews. The place across the street was busier, but the owner talked us in. So glad he did. First, the bread. I could eat this all day, and my youngest was in heaven. Ordered the Arugula salad and Caprese salad, so flavorful. Next, meatballs on the side, ravioli, and the prosciutto and arugula pizza. Just awesome, the crust was so delicious and the sauce was perfect. Finished with gelato and cappuccino. The check was extremely reasonable for the quality and my family of four was stuffed and happy.We've visited Italy and the pasta and pizza are hard to replicate, but this place nails it. Don't be put off by the decor, which looks like a graphic designer went a bit overboard, the food is the real deal.

Piccolo Forno just opened a few days ago, and I tried it out for lunch today. With the Italian Homemade just across the street, it's great to see North Beach moving farther north.I had a slice of the mushroom pizza and two supplis (fried rice balls). The mushroom pizza was pretty good - the crust was thick but crispy. Similar in style to Golden Boy, but thinner and crispier. The sauce and toppings were tasty as well. The owner mentioned that they're expecting a new pizza oven from Italy soon, so perhaps the pizzas will change a bit when it arrives.The supplis were very interesting, and I had not tried them before. They appear to be fried risotto, mixed with bolognese sauce and parmesan cheese, then breaded and fried. They were very tasty. Although they heated them up for me when I ordered them, they were still a bit cool in the center.Overall, Piccolo Forno is a nice addition to North Beach, and I'll definitely be back.

I can honestly say this is the pasta I've ever had! We stumbled upon this place while exploring Little Italy and I can't wait to go back. They were able to seat 7 of us right away, although it is a smaller space the food makes it worth it. People in our party wanted lasagna and they had just ran out, so the owner said we could wait 30 minutes and he would bring out fresh made lasagna. This lasagna was absolutely amazing! I personally order the cheese tortellini and I loved it. However, I did try their specials for the day and wished I would have order them for myself. They had a butternut squash ravioli that was to die for. Great flavor and texture! The dish that made my fall in love with this place was their asparagus ravioli with white truffle. I've never tried truffle before and was excited to try it. This ravioli was beautiful, the best I've had. It's hard to describe the flavor but I can't wait to go back and order this! The owner was exceptional, very welcoming, and kind. BEST PASTA!

this place is solid. Some highlights:- really nice/new/clean space. Great place for a casual lunch or even dinner.- I had the spaghetti/meatballs. It was very good. Good portion. I finished everything. - I've had the pizza here too. A slice of square mushroom, sausage. I didnt think it was very memorable. I thought it needed more sauce and I wish they had left it in the pizza oven for a bit longer to crisp up and melt the cheese. I can't help but to compare Piccolo Forno to Italian Homemade which is just across the street. Italian Homemade makes their own noodles in shop which is a huge difference to me. I think Piccolo Forno uses regular store bought dry noodles. The meatballs at Italian Homemade are almost twice as big as well and you really just get the feeling that they put more love into their food. So for me, it's a no brainer to go to Italian Homemade since prices are pretty much comparable.

Wow! This little restaurant is authentic, delicious and fresh. Everyone (including the kids) loved it! My family's reviews: the pasta with spicy red sauce was amazing and the Pizza Margherita was excellent. The owner was incredibly kind and accommodating with my dietary restrictions: he created an amazing dish that avoided things I can't eat (which says a lot, considering I am a gluten and dairy free customer eating Italian food). The result was divine: gluten-free Fettuccine with mildly spicy olive oil, garlic, spinach and herbs. Yum. We will be back.

What a great authentic Italian food! I went to sushi restaurant next to this place and walked in to get a coffee. They had a really good pizza and roast pork. The owner was working in kitchen and they make their own bread too. Even coffee was delicious! !!!

Excellent service and food! The staff was very friendly and attentive. If you are in a hurry or starving, they have pizzas premade in a glass case in the front. We ordered a few slices for our kids upfront, which were okay. We then ordered a pizza with caramelized onions/tuna and spaghetti with marinara, which were absolutely delicious. The marinara is so fresh and tasty - we did not let one drop go to waste by soaking it all up with our bread/pizza crust!

Amazing pizza and pasta, plus the friendliest service! Highly recommend the burrata, which they have delivered daily from LA. A gem of a place.

Piccolo Forno is an excellent Italian restaurant in North Beach.I ordered the special, a breaded pork medallion and it was superb. The seasoning was tasty and the sauce was elegant. The price was reasonable; I think it was about $16 for the port medallion and vegetables.The waiter was helpful in making recommendations.The restaurant is small but that has a nice touch. Piccolo Forno also offers a variety of pizzas in addition to traditional Italian dinners. I recommend this place. The only downside is that there is no private parking lot; metered street parking only.
