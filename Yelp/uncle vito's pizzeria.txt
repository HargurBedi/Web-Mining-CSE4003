I decided to get a Pizza from Uncle Vito's Pizza while waiting for my laundry to complete across the road. At around 9:30 pm on Sunday it was slammed. Upon entering you will find the ordering station to your right, if front of the open kitchen. There is a small strip of space near the entrance that is used to place orders, pick up pizzas, come in and go out of the restaurant, so when they are full you will literally be standing on top of each other in this narrow space to order. The person taking orders was obviously having a bad day. He was out rightly rude to people who were simply placing orders. When my turn came I decided to get a medium Greek pizza ($16.50) which has feta cheese, salami, pepperoni, bell pepper and black olives. I was a little hesitant to customize, but then I said what the heck we are paying for this, we should be able to choose, so I subbed the pepperoni with sausage. Thankfully there was no drama.Anyway after ordering, without exaggeration, I waited 30 minutes for my pizza. It was too cold to wait outside so I found a small chair inside. Let's come to the pizza. It is your hand tossed thin crust pizza that was badly made. It seems to be a Neapolitan style pizza, but it lacks the crispy crust and delicate balance of sauce and cheese that keeps the pizza from becoming soggy and mush. This one had way too much sauce and cheese making it a soft soggy mess. It could have used some more time in the oven, but I guess because they were so slammed they seemed to be rushing orders out without proper quality control.Price wise they are in line with what you would pay at other pizza joints, but the quality and service is seriously lacking. Delarosa & Pachino both of which are within 10 mins of Vito's manage to do pizza right. Vito's is just super popular. I don't get the draw is so I'll pass.

Bit of a wait to be seated. The lady handling the take out counter and acting as hostess was very nice, but the wait staff were inattentive and somewhat rude. They've tried to cram too many tables into the dining area. Kudos to them for trying to accommodate more customers, but what's the point if everyone is uncomfortable?Pizza is good. It's thin crust and sort of NY style as the name would sort of imply. We ordered a half-pepperoni/half-hamburger-mushroom. Both sides were delicious. My daughter got the spaghetti, but the sauce was a bit heavy on the tomato flavor (almost like they just dumped a can of crushed tomatoes over the pasta without any herbs or seasoning).Their iced tea is horrible. It's probably made from concentrate and comes out of a fountain dispenser like only soda should.I recommend getting takeout to avoid the wait for a table and their not-so-friendly wait staff.4 stars for the pizza. 2 stars for the service.

Absolutly amazing pizza Bianco!!! OMG the dough was light and fluffy. One of the best I ever had. The toppings were so fresh. The service was fast and satisfying. Very professional. The atmosphere is intimate and very warm. Great first stop on our first family trip San Francisco. This is definitely an must stop in San Francisco!!!

Your average pizza place providing average pizza. We got a pizza here to go for dinner mainly because it was so close to our hotel. We placed an order for a 12 inch veggie pizza with pepperoni by phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.When we arrived (20+ minutes later) the pizza was ready for us. When we got back to the hotel and opened up the box it looked and smelled very delectable. The taste was just average though. The center of the pizza was super soggy and the crust didn't have a lot of flavor nor did it have a noticeable interplay between crisp crust and soft interior. The pizza place itself was a bit dark inside and a little grimy feeling. I'd probably only get food from here again if I were looking for something open a little later in the evening and were in the immediate area and too lazy to eat in.

I live 2 blocks away and this place always hits the spot whether I want a meatball sandwich, pasta of sorts, or a personal size pizza.A very big part of me doesn't even want to write bc I don't want them to increase their prices or it to get too busy. Selfish... I know. Just not trying to blow up a neighborhood spot.

"Leave the gun, take the cannoli." - The GodfatherAhh such fond memories of my once favorite pizzeria! Ok, the thing about coming to a place 100 times is you start noticing the fine details or lack of it over time. Sadly, my onetime 5-stars rated pizzeria is closer to 3-stars now, yet in my heart I need to be generous at 4-stars! Just too many memories of the area and oh that Calzone! Uncle Vito's! The Calzone! To me it's all about the Calzone: the signature stuffed pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, salami, ricotta & mozzarella (can be substituted for vegetarian). They make it right here, though lately I noticed slightly smaller, slightly less filling, and slightly rising prices /sigh. I guess being located in Nob Hill it is inevitable that this would happen, so no hard feelings. Located on Bush st. & Powell st. it is literally on a hill in the heart of San Francisco! The cable car drops you off right at the doorstep if need be! As you enter you'll be at the tossing the pizza window. If you want to eat-in, turn to your left, and step-up a couple steps. It's somewhat crammed, but hey it's an Italian pizzeria! Service is usually hit or miss here... like I said I've been here 100 times & still it's hit or miss. Even with my Italian silks on!Uncle Vito's! Lastly, I'll be back, but it's just no longer my fav pizzeria. That went out with 98 Degrees and the reduced ricotta. I still love my Calzone & the spaghetti & meatballs weren't bad either. Good memories here, and why that's amore!

Been wanting to come here for years, and finally got a chance to sample Uncle Vito's. I wasn't disappointed, the pizza has delicious flavor and the toppings are nice and big. We took it to go because it's pretty small inside, but I'd definitely come back.

Great pasta dishes and ok pizza. Pasta is cooked al dente. The creamy sauces are garlicky the way I like them. The chicken in the Alfredo was tender and moist. I will definitely be back for these dishes.Pizzas have a great thin crust with char that adds great texture and some flavor but the topping I believe lacked. On the Pesto I tasted the onions, cheese, and black olives BUT no pesto. I could see the pesto, I just couldn't taste it. The Hawaiian flavor was dominated by the Canadian bacon smokiness. I am not saying the pizzas are bad they just might need some adjustments. Maybe the one pasta cook can help the 5 pizza makers to perfect the pizzas?My hat goes off to the only two waitresses that are none stop. We were seated upstairs and we never felt abandoned. Thank you girls!

This place has the worst service ever. I literally waited for more than 30 min just for a spaghetti with meat sauce. A family of three who came 10 min after us already received their food... I couldn't wait any longer so I walked out and had them cancel my order. The waiter notified me that they were making my food... Seriously?????? Awful service!!!!

Im going two stars. Ordered the meat calzone. While It was togo, I felt it lacked flavor, the bottom was a thick layer of flour. Not consistent with the expected hand tossed amount. This was clearly in error. A thick layer coated the entire base. Calzone was wattery and runnny. When you're looking for a "cheat" meal, in my opinion, you want it to be spot on. I want those calories to count towards a GREAT meal. Uncle Vito! Step your game up son!

Open windows that let the summer breeze into this restaurant adorned with photos and portraits of a San Francisco past puts the charm of this place front and center. The pizza isn't half bad either, it's almost a New York style thin crust. They serve pints of Sierra Nevada for under $4 which is a bargain in my book.The staff isn't really friendly but efficiently seats and serves which is what is important to me. Would recommend to anyone in Nob Hill.

The food, I'm a fan of. The service seemed to be lacking a bit. A few friends + a baby came by on Saturday around 2 for lunch. The place is pretty small, but it wasn't full. No one greeted us when we walked in, despite the kitchen being next to the front door. We had to ask/repeat ourselves about 5 times, stating there were 4 adults plus a baby. 5 times! We even pointed out an open table that could accommodate us and we still got some questioning looks- very weird. Anyhow, we were offered a high chair and seated. As stated, the place is small so the tables are pretty close together. The first thing I looked at on the menu was wine, and for $2.75 a glass, count me in! Well, count me in either way, but that price is a steal. We ordered a few items for the table to share and they came out pretty quick. One member ordered a sandwich but didn't get fries; we looked at menu and only the burgers came with fries- we thought that was odd. We did have to ask for napkins a few times as well before we got them. The food was pretty good, the greek salad, minestrone soup and pizza were all delish.

I've gotten uncle vito's to go a few times and it's been pretty consistent each time. I'm a fan of their crispy crusts, but I feel like their dough is always slightly undercooked on my orders. The pizzas and calzones I've tried are always super soggy towards the middle and end up falling apart. I would come back more if the entire pizza could be crispy like their crusts are.

Looking for a late night snack, I decided to head to Uncle Vito's for a Calzone before they closed. I ordered a medium 12" for 17 dollars and change to go. Wait was about 15 minutes or less even as they seemed to have a bit of a full house. Pros- ingredients( cheese, pepperoni, salami, mushrooms) were flavorful and dough was crispy on top, short wait, open late, great location to see passing cable cars while you wait.Cons- dough could use a pinch more salt to my liking, wish they had a bar area to drink a beer while I waited for my order.If I come back to SF I would definitely head back here for a Calzone.

A definite SF staple. I have passed this place a million times and finally checked it out. I LOVED it. The pizza was amazing and the fettuccine alfredo was just as good. My friend ordered a grilled chicken salad and even that was delicious. I consider myself a pizza connoisseur and this is on my list of top 5 pizza places. The service was very delightful and pleasant. There was nice crowd of people new and regulars with that SF city feel.

Garlic bread w/cheese: very average. Kind of like the French bread you buy at the market w/a few slices of mozzarella on top. Wasn't spectacular or particularly outstanding. Not bad- just average. Skip. Cheese ravioli- the breaded part was really underwhelming. Not fully coated w/breading, and the breading wasn't really crispy. Soggy ravioli w/mildly crispy breading. The ravioli wasn't flavored very well, & the only thing that had some flavor was the thin marinara that came with it. Skip.

Consistently the best pizza I have ever had in San Francisco! Salads are fantastic! I highly recommend the Caesar salad and add chicken. It's not crappy pre-made frozen chicken. It's an actual chicken breast which they cook right there on the grill. Definitely worth the money! Sometimes, it can be tricky placing an order, depending who is working. But I have to say that special mention should go to Martin, Jaime and Jose! They always make my experience extra fun with how truly helpful they are every time I see them! Uncle Vito's is fantastic!

This place was so delicious and reasonably priced that we ate here both of the two consecutive nights we were in town. Tiny opening to the restaurant and it gets crowded and there was a wait both times but SO worth it. Calzone was amazing and cooked perfectly. Not doughy inside at all like how calzones can sometimes be. Chicken Caesar was delicious and the marinated grilled chicken on top was so flavorful I got a portion to-go to give my dog who was waiting back at the hotel.We tried two pastas, the pasta Siena, which had chicken, sundried tomatoes and pesto, and the spaghetti and meatballs. Both were amazing. Also, a carafe of wine for $9 doesn't hurt ;) 10/10 would come here again when in San Francisco!

Affordable and tasty eats near Nob Hill. Picky eater kid declared the Pesto Fettuccine the best ever. We stayed at a hotel nearby and appreciated the quick service and economical alternative.

Decided to go to Uncle Vito's while on vacation here in San Francisco since we were in the mood for Italian food. Fairly small place, but it felt cozy and warm compared to the cold weather outside. We got two appetizers -cheesy garlic bread and ravioli friti- that were both fantastic, and for our entrees (we were hungry after a plane trip) we got the spaghetti and meatballs which had a rich meat sauce and perfect al dente spaghetti. Also we got the daily special, which was chicken ravioli with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and a creamy garlic sauce that blew any other ravioli I've had out of the water. Another plus was that the meal was relatively cheap: about 30 bucks for the food and two glasses of wine. In all, this was one of the best meals I've had in a while and it was fairly cheap. The staff were very friendly and came by often. I would recommend this to anybody passing through San Francisco.

Went here with my GF (Vegetarian) while on vacation in SF.This is a small little place like most in and around the Union Square area. When we went at around 8p.m. on a Friday night it was packed with a line out the door, to be expected... We decided to order a pizza to go and just eat back at our hotel room only a block and a half away to get away from the crowds. Upon looking at the menu they had a great selection of Pizza and deciding which one to order was fairly difficult because they all sounded so good! We ended up ordering a large Pesto Pizza to go, due to the larger crowd of people in line and ordering food the pizza did take a little while to be prepared, right around 30 minutes. When we received it, it was so difficult not to just devour the entire pizza while walking back to the hotel because it smelled amazing! It ended up tasting even better than it smelled...For the price, which was somewhere around $20.00 it was worth the money. The ingredients tasted very fresh and the crust had a crunch that led to a soft center. Would definitely go back the next time I am in the area

I honestly should've read the yelp reviews more thoroughly because I was so disappointed in the pizza that I ordered from here. They do not sell pizzas by the slice so I had to order a small Mountain Pizza (basically a combo). The cashier told me the small had about 4 slices which I thought would be perfect since I was sharing with two other people. What could go wrong right? The place was packed and once I placed by order I waited about 25 minutes for my pizza which I took to go. When I opened up the box what I saw was literally the saddest looking pizza staring back at me. The small sized pizza was thin crust with sausages spread all over one half. You can tell it was rushed and there was zero effort put in. The slices were TINY it was more like a personal pizza. It seems like the 5 star reviews are referencing more towards the pastas and other menu items. As for pizza, avoid this place and go somewhere else!

Who would have thought Nob Hill had decently priced quality food? Uncle Vito's was a random spot my husband and I stumbled upon as we were walking through the neighborhood. He normally likes to order the daily special, while I toggle between a salad or their veggie burgers. The food is nothing spectacular, however the service is fast (if you can get a seat), and the prices are good for the area. This is our normal stop off as we walk home from work. Keep up the great work Uncle Vito!

Tucked on the corner with a tiny dining area and some space upstairs is the by far the best pizza I have had in San Fran. It gets pretty hectic and they probably need some more wait staff, but I understand why people line up and wait for the food.The waiter took a long time to get to us as he appeared to be the only one there along with the owner (I assume). We put our order in and started with the fried ravioli. It was delivered in about 3 minutes and was fantastic. The cheese tasted like fresh mozzarella and not store frozen. If it wasn't made in house then I would be very surprised. I had half veggie and half cheese pizza and it was so good. The crust was just right, the cheese was fresh, and the veggies were great. My friend had the fettuccine Alfredo and she loved it. It looked creamy and rich on her plate. For San Fran the prices were awesome too. I would come back here on my next trip. It is hectic and chaotic and reminds me a NYC pizza joint.

Vito Pizza is advertised as NY style pizza. I was craving pizza and this was close to my hotel - being originally from NY, I was extra excited. I ordered a personal 8" pizza topped with artichoke, onion and mushroom. I also got one of their house salads, which was iceberg lettuce, lots of mozzarella, a sprinkling of kidney beans and chickpeas and some tomato. The pizza was just okay. Cheese was a bit unevenly distributed (heavy blobs on parts and none on others) and there was very little sauce (and no zip to the sauce that was there). There were a good scattering of veggies, which I appreciated. Unlike true NY pizza, the crust felt a bit soggy. My overall pizza craving was satisfied, but not in the best way it could've been.The salad wasn't special - typical pizza place salad. I did appreciate the amount of beans in it though.They have a big menu of sandwiches, salads, pizzas and pastas, so maybe I didn't order well. It seemed to be a pretty typical just okay pizza place though. I got takeout and it was ready in about 12 minutes, but there is a small seating area with waitress service.

I came here on a Friday night with a few friends. We were waiting to meet other friends so we decided to get a quick bite to eat. We ordered our food to go. I got a simple personal size pepperoni pizza and my friend got spaghetti. We got our food and found out our friends were running late. So we asked to eat our food inside. The waitress with the blonde hair (didn't catch her name) said we could not since we ordered to go we couldn't dine-in. We decided it was okay and we'll eat in their to-go section. But then it became too difficult because my friend ordered spaghetti. -__- So we saw two empty tables and asked the waitress if we could sit there for a bit, she again denied us. We decided to just leave because it didn't seem like she didn't want to help us even though we were paying customers (we tipped too). So we asked her for some Parmesan and she said "All to-go orders have to be helped over there" and pointed to the cashier area. Then walked away. No one was at the cash register so we had to bug a chef to help us. I was very disappointed in my service at Uncle Vito's. The waitress was extremely rude to us. We left and ended up eating on a stoop we found and the food was just not enjoyable at all. The pizza was extremely greasy, like those cheap pizzas they gave you in high school cafeterias. And the spaghetti had a very strong taste to it. It was not good. My friend and I could not finish our food and we were HUNGRY. Not a very good experience. Never coming back.

Easy place for a quick lunch. Love how everything is made fresh (and you watch them make their dough through the window!)For $22 dollars you can easily feed 3 people. Food is good but not overwhelming phenomenal that you'd have to come dine again. Still better than a lot of pizzerias I've tried in San Francisco.I wish the place was more spacious. It was a little difficult to be seated properly without bumping into the guest dining on the tables next to us.

Was really looking forward to eating here but leaving severely disappointed. The food was below average and the service made it even worse.The place was completely empty when we walked in at 4 pm. The waitress would not allow us to sit at a table for four. And she was rude about it. Save your money and time!

Food was good, however service was lacking idk if he always the server but he's not friendly and just takes your order and walks off. We ordered some waters and he said... "I know." The other staff was nice and food was good though.

Service was frazzled. Waitress kept apologizing. It wasn't that busy. Food was soso.if you love heavy dressing on your Caesar salad, stale crust and flat soda, this is the place for you. However, the people were polite.

While I was fortunate enough that I didn't have to wait, and was able to get a table right away, I did notice several customers over the course of my meal who did end up waiting. I felt somewhat guilty, taking in the taste of my meal as they watched.That being said, the establishment itself is atmospheric, exuding the aura of an Italian pizzeria. I ordered the calzone and the fettuccine with baby clams, all impressively delivered within fifteen minutes. The calzone was scrumptious; a tad soggy, but still good. I wasn't too fond of the fettuccine, but after running it through several of my friends, I found my dislike only stemmed from my personal preferences, as everyone else enjoyed it. The complimentary garlic bread, however, we all agreed didn't have enough flavor to it, but since it was free, I can kind of let it go.Service was nice, nothing to write home about, but nothing too rage-inducing either. I did eventually need to get the waiters' attention for my bill and to attend to my plates, but we managed to get it worked out. The chefs I could hear were somewhat distressed in the kitchen, though. I hope that's not a regular thing, because their distress can get rather loud and slightly obscene.Overall, I enjoyed it. While I'm not sure I'd be willing to wait for a table, I do think the food is good, service is nice, and the building itself is well maintained. Because it's situated sort of halfway up the workout of a hill that is Powell Street, I think it's a good place to stop by if you ever pass by. Worth the climb, in my opinion.

Pizza was decent but nothing to write home about. The service was lacking. The waitress didn't have the greatest attitude and everyone seemed to have an issue with their order (wrong item, missing item, etc). I didn't like how soggy my crust was either. I would give it another chance though.

The pepperoni pizza was excellent, New York style thin crust was better than average. The pizza price was fair and the wine tasted great for the price. The dinning area was in need of serious renovation and the server wasn't attentive. The pizza and wine helps you get over that part a bit.

The concierge at our hotel recommended us to head here if we wanted good pizza - and they were right. The salads were a nice size where three of us decently split a good Caesar salad. My sister got the veggie pizza with two vegetable substitutions and my mom and I split a three topping pizza. All the food was delicious and we were scraping our plates (which may have also been our hunger). The service was a bit slow and it seems like only one or two servers were on duty. It appeared that we had to remind our server we had ordered a salad.

By far the best food and the prices are unbeatable. We had the meat calzone (huge!) great flavor, best mixture of everything. Also had the fried raviolis, delicious!! A must try when in SF

Walked into this place after walking around aimlessly looking for food. WAS not disappointed. Perfect pizza. Perfect cut, not too messy. Wait staff was personable, while also letting us eat in peace. Would definitely come back next time we're in the city!

Probably my favorite pizza in San Francisco! A nice cozy spot in Nob Hill. I've been here a few times and have always had good service.

We started off with a Caesar salad. The grilled chicken actually tasted grilled and the salad was nice and fresh. The calzone was very tasty and quite big! If you are looking for fresh pizza and friendly people give this place a shot!

Our tour guide recommend this restaurant, and boy was it good! It's a bit small, but that didn't bother us. This will be our go to spot when we visit SF again.

I go occasionally on business trips to San Francisco. I am usually always trying out new places, but I tend to go back to this one.Uncle Vito's is a simple, and to the point venue where you can enjoy authentic, rich and tasty pizzas. Wondering why there is almost always a queue to this place and seldom any space inside ? Wonder not anymore...- Situated in a touristy spot (Powell St) but it's absolutely not a tourist trap. - You have to wait 15-20 minutes when ordering take away.- The kitchen is exposed and you can see cooks in action and how pro they are- Portions are generous and most importantly the ingredients are generously placed.- Tip: if you want to avoid queues, come after 22.Needless to say, you should try it out if you are considering visiting San Francisco!

Uncle Vito's has been a carby staple in my life ever since my good-ish old elementary school days at a nearby school. After a mean school day or a long day in the city, a slice at Vito's has been the gooey, cheesy fix for me and my family.THE HIGHLIGHTS.+ Cute, quaint little pizza joint serving up nothing but the good stuff+ Solid Italian food, especially their Mountain House combo+ Great place for a low-key hangout + Reasonably priced for the awesome serving sizes you get~ Parking can be a no-go, you're best off in lot across from the NDV churchI'll admit, I don't make it out to Uncle Vito's too often these days, but they hold a fond place in my heart, for sure!
