Best prime rib ever! My boyfriend and I were visiting and this place was one of the things to try on our list. Unfortunately one month before our trip, I've attempted to do a reservation for the short amount of time we were in San Francisco, there were no available dates left!!So because we have been wanting to really try this place out, we ended up doing a walk in and waited for 1.5 hours! Was it worth it? OF COURSE. The waiting area was very comfortable and you are also allowed to order drinks while waiting. Everything about the food and service was great. Heck, the salad was even good! I got the house of prime rib cut, with creamy spinach and mashed potatoes. Idk what that piece of bread was on my plate, but it tasted great too!All I know is that next time I do come back to town, I will definitely book a reservation in advance!

Difficult to rate. As good as this sort of thing gets. Super-pro staff, chilled salad bowls, meticulous preparation and accommodation to your whims and needs, efficient system, and deep enough menu for a good enough time. Lacks all pretense. Style would make your dad happy but may leave you wondering if you've become such a yuppie that appeals to 1950's style leave you cold. Many dishes that can only be described as good for white man or spoiled children. A guilty pleasure for contemporary people.Great martinis and cocktails for table service. People watching is very interesting for SF. You won't believe you ate the whole thing!

Really disappointed here. I made reservations 2 weeks in advanced & arrive on time, actually 10 mins early, to find we still had to wait. 15 mins became 30 and then became an hour. I'm 7 months pregnant! I can't wait that long to eat and made them aware our reservations were at 7pm. We ended up leaving after an hour. I can't believe how unorganized, insensitive to my condition and rude this place was.I've never experienced that type of treatment from a resturant. The worst part was it was also my boyfriend's birthday and sadly we left because he was worried about me waiting too long to eat.I really wish this place would get their act together as I heard great things about it but not at the sacrifice of my health or my baby's.

This is my second time to House of Prime Rib, and the food never disappoints. They don't have much selection in terms of menu, but they specialize in prime rib. I am a well-done cooked kinda gal, and this is how I rate restaurants. The well-done prime rib still tasted delicious 2 days later and microwaved. It wasn't undercooked at all at the restaurant either. I love potatoes and hates that I had to choose between the two sides. It also comes with creamed spinach, creamed corn, salad, and Yorkshire pudding. My only complaint is that the servers aren't as attentive as hoped. It took us a few times to flag our server down to get new knives because the ones set at our table were dirty. We also had to flag down our server to remind him to bring us the horseradish. Otherwise, food is GREAT and this is definitely a must visit.

More fun than should be allowed at a steakhouse! My view of House of Prime Rib is that it's San Francisco's answer to Tampa's Berns steakhouse. We arrived last minute without a reservation, gasp! Waited almost 2 hours for two seats at the bar! Well worth the trip as well as the wait! We entertained throughout the wait however, by a woman who sat at the bar had everything from soup to nuts, then proceeded to ask for a manager to complain that her steak a.k.a. prime rib was too fatty she proceeded to take home three bags of extras which appeared to be another slab of beef salad bread everything you could imagine that she stuffed into extra to go bags. It was appalling. The service at the bar was incredible. The prime rib was over the top good. Dessert drinks everything no complaints here.My next trip to San Francisco will include a reservation at the house of prime rib to experience the full on service! Well done, the experience not the meat!!

Updated review
Still my favorite meal in San Francisco!Recently, someone asked me why I don't Yelp much about San Francisco establishments. My reply was pretty straightforward: "Traffic and crowd". Believe me, after dealing with traffic and people for more than two decades as a job, the last thing I want to do is to spend my off time dealing with more traffic and people. The rise of the Bay Area over the last decade has made going in and out of the City a horrendous nightmare. As such, I don't cross the bridge much these days. There are exceptions though. House of Prime Rib (HoPR) is one of them.If you have never been here, HoPR is located on busy Van Ness Avenue. My best advice is to utilize public transportation such as Muni, taxi, Uber/Lyft etc. Parking is a nightmare in that neighborhood. If you don't heed my advice and choose to drive, they do have valet service. Use it.This place is so popular that reservations need to be made way ahead of time. Nine of us came here last night for dinner at 5:00pm and our reservation was made in early August. Be advised they don't do reservations of 10 or more people for weekends. King Henry VIII cut ($48.85) is the only thing I get here and that's what I got last night. I ordered it rare and it was superb! The salad, baked potato, creamed spinach, and Yorkshire pudding were very good as well. Service we received was excellent. Our server, Jackie, was attentive and efficient. As soon as I finished my prime rib, she offered me a second slice (much smaller). Of course I took up her offer!Eating here is a San Francisco tradition. You need to do this at least once. Still highly recommended!

My friends and I made plans to come here, however when I checked for reservations they were all booked up! The only available reservations were around 9pm! We decided to show up and wait. I read a couple reviews wherein guests waited 2-3 hours so I expected to wait that long, especially because we came around dinner time on a Saturday night! Thankfully, we only waited around an hour. They have a pretty large bar and lounge area for those who are waiting. We were able to snag a table and ordered drinks while we waited. They have no beers on tap, but they have several bottled beers. I went with a Moscow Mule - I liked that they allowed me to choose my vodka. I normally don't get asked so I thought that was nice.We started off with their sourdough bread - so warm and fluffy and probably more amazing than it was because we were starving! Then came the salad and cornbread. The salad is seasoned and dressed in a large bowl on ice and served with chilled forks... What?! I'm not sure if that's necessary, but I enjoyed it! The salad is huge and their house vinaigrette is awesome. I really shouldn't have stuffed myself with salad, because I still had the HOPR cut with all the fixings! They gave us several pieces of cornbread. Pretty tasty! We had a 1.5 year old with us and she seemed to enjoy gnawing on it!On to the good stuff: my HOPR cut was perfectly rare, tender, and sooo delicious. The best prime rib I've ever had! I love that they have 3 levels of horseradish sauces. I used the creamy medium one and the sinus clearing hot one. So freakin' good with the prime rib. The mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and corn were good, but I really wasn't concentrating on them! There was also Yorkshire Pudding, which I didn't eat too much of as I was saving that room for the prime rib. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this! It's like flakey puffed flatbread. We had absolutely no room for dessert, however we were celebrating two birthdays so they gave us some complementary ice cream. Overall, wonderful value for this experience. Service was excellent. The staff constantly checked up on us and were so friendly and accommodating with the toddler. We will definitely be back!

HOPR is definitely a little pricy, but for the amount of food you get, its sooooo worth it. I decided I wanted to come here for my birthday dinner a little too late, so my boyfriend and I were unable to get reservations. Instead we decided to go right when they opened for cocktails, to put our name on the waiting list. We were the 3rd or party there, and were seated at 5:30 (right when dinner starts). To start, I ordered a mojito, which was a little pricy ($13), but it was in a really tall glass. My boyfriend ordered a moscow mule. Both drinks were pretty standard, nothing amazing. Once we were seated, we were served REALLY warm sourdough bread with butter. I didn't want to eat to much of it, because I wanted to save room for the prime rib (even though sourdough is my favorite). After, came the house salad, which they mix infront of you. It was pretty good, although next time I think I might ask for dressing on the side because it was a little too much. As far as the actual meal, I ordered the House of Prime rib cut with mashed potatoes and spinach. My boyfriend ordered the King Henry Cut with baked potato- his was loaded with EVERYTHING (bacon, sour cream, butter). We both loved all the sides, except the yorkshire pudding which was just okay (I preferred the sourdough). The meat itself is amazing, but I would recommend the House cut, my boyfriend wasn't able to finish his King Henry cut and he usually has a huge appetite. If you really are still hungry after the House cut, you can reuest an extra slice!Overall, great service and food. My only complaint was that the food was a little salty overall.

House of Prime Rib was the best best prime rib I've ever had (though I'm no connoisseur since I haven't had it much). Came here expecting a good prime rib and that's exactly what you'll get. While the price is expensive, you can get a lot of food (plus more if you finish). Dinner includes warm sourdough bread and butter, salad mixed table-side, prime rib, two sides, and yorkshire pudding.+ENGLISH CUT: This is a thinner sliced cut but honestly it seems like it's based on preference. My SO got the King Henry VIII cut and he loved it. I tried his (and while it's still delicious), I still prefer the thinner cut. I had it rare and it was juicy and tender!+CREAMED SPINACH: This has bacon bits in it which added to the savoriness of this side. It was delicious and a great addition to the prime rib.+MASHED POTATOES: The standout of this side was definitely the gravy. It was great with the prime rib as well!+YORKSHIRE PUDDING: This is great to soak up the juices and gravy, and I just topped it with spinach as well. Though this was quite filling as I also ate a lot of bread at the beginning of the meal.+SALAD: This was also tasty and the meal comes with a LOT of salad. I knew that I had a smaller appetite so I didn't eat as much of this. While it was tasty and I can see how it is a great accompaniment, I much prefer eating the meat and sides. Though it's notable that they have their own dressing.The food here is delicious and heavy (but it's prime rib and sides so what do you expect). We were hoping to try some dessert but honestly were too full after the meal. They even asked us if we wanted seconds but we were too full. The service was great as well. Our reservation was for 4:30PM (we made a last minute one) and came early, but was seated right away. The staff was great throughout; our water was refilled quite quickly and checked in on us. Since we sat in a more cramped location, the prime rib counter was farther away from us but they still made an effort to introduce the chef that was cutting our prime rib, which was nice.All in all, the best prime rib experience that I've had, especially if you come expecting just that. While it is on the pricey side, it is a lot of food. I'm glad I had this experience in San Francisco as I've heard a lot about it.

Updated review
"For people who's thing is prime rib, I can see how this would be amazing." Says the Boyfriend who doesn't prefer prime rib as his choice of red meat.And so I must apologize for my initial review. The House of Prime Rib doesn't get its name for no reason. I'm pretty sure it's the only restaurant in SF that has "prime rib" in the name. And boy, do they deserve it. You're not just paying $40-$50 for a delicious slab of meat. You're also paying for all the accompaniments for your entire meal:1) You start out with the sourdough bread. I didn't eat any because I was worried it'd make me too full. Turns out it was a good decision. But I heard it was delicious.2) The House Salad was beautiful, tossed right in front of you, and delicious. The beets made it a pretty red-ish color. I LOVE the crunchiness of a salad - not like nuts or crispy noodles - but the crispness of lettuce.3) Ordering the English Cut medium rare was DEFINITELY the way to go. So tender and juicy. Easy to cut. Not too much fat. Just look at that glistening meat. And the au jus. I definitely asked for more of that delicious gravy and slowly poured it all over the red meat. YOU CAN EVEN GET SECONDS! After 12 hours, I can still taste the meat and the mouth-watering au jus...4) As everyone else already mentioned, DON'T GET THE MASHED POTATOES! The Baked Potato is what you want - fully loaded with butter, sour cream, bacon, and chives. And that is why I like baked potato over mashed.5) Cream Spinach or Cream Corn? It's really up to you. I enjoyed my Cream Corn thoroughly. But the rest of the table was raving about their Cream Spinach. But I thought it was just mehh. Really, I would've wanted another baked potato...6) What is Yorkshire Bread Pudding really? Why is it called a pudding when it's really just a thin fluffy pastry? I don't understand but I don't think anyone was a fan of this bread pudding either.6 courses for $50 per person???? I'd say it's pretty worth it. But I also ordered the House Made Tiramisu, which was amazing. So soft and moist! It comes in a puddle of...coffee or something? It definitely had a coffee-like taste to it. We also received a complimentary sorbet for our birthday girl!Boyfriend also ordered a Manhattan, which was quite good from what I hear. You even get a selection of alcohols to choose from. And the drink is brought to you with the shaker so you can refill your own drink. Just make sure you don't actually shake it. Just kinda move your wrist in a circular motion to stir it.I actually took one point away for the service. The servers were outgoing and nice, but I had to ask for a few things a couple times, which is always a turn-off for me.But in general, it was a good experience. Fun birthday dinner.

If I had to choose between Lawry's Prime Rib or House of Prime Rib, I'd definitely choose HOPR, hands down. You can find Lawry's in Beverly Hills, Chicago, Dallas, Vegas, and even in Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Seoul. House of Prime Rib, however, is only in SF.I made reservations through Opentable, so the wait wasn't too bad once we got there. The style of service and the sides offered with your meal is almost the same as Lawry's, but the prime rib, sides and everything overall was just so much better here. The different levels of horseradish complimented it perfectly. This is definitely on my must visit list, every time we're in SF.The only complaint I have about this place is that our server didn't offer the other members of our party the "complimentary second slice" after they finished their King Henry VIII cut. We all ordered wine and drinks, so it wasn't like we were sitting there with a Groupon and glasses of water haha.

I don't even know where to start....Best prime rib I ever ate, hands down.I couldn't tell you what cut I had I think it was the English cut, the meat was very very VERY juicy and just amazingly delicious. Au jus sauce compliments very well with the prime rib, just absolutely heaven. I ordered spinach and mashed potatoes. Read reviews about how the spinach had less spinach and more cream. My spinach had equal ratio of spinach and cream, and tasted just fine. The menu describes the spinach having bacon, did not taste that. Potatoes tasted like potatoes, tbh the prime rib were so good I can't even remember if anything else was good. If you finish your prime rib, you get another sliver of prime rib for free. Server was friendly, helpful, and quick! We had a table of 20, reserved 3-4 months ahead of time. Once we all had arrived, we waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated as they steered all 20 of us towards the bar. If you want to make people feel jelly by using Snapchat or IG stories videos, sit closest to the Mobile silver oven stand thing where the chef will dramatically cut your slice. The restaurant is very small and tight, may not have elbow space depending on where you are seated. If I plan to come back to SF, I will DEFINITELY make my way here and wait for hours if I have to.Oh... and your leftovers will still taste magnificent the next day!!!

i booked a reservation two months in advance for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. we were seated within a few minutes. HOPR's menu is very simple with limited options, making it easy for customers to choose what they want. we both decided to order the english cut which includes yorkshire pudding, corn or spinach, and mashed potatoes or baked potato. my boyfriend ordered the corn and baked potato while i ordered the bacon spinach and baked potato. if you ordered the mash potato over the baked potato, you're making a big mistake! their baked potatoes are so delicious. it's loaded with bacon, butter, sour cream, and onions! we were served with sourdough bread and butter to start us off. then we had a large plate of salad. then finally, our main dishes came out. the english cut was really easy to cut and eat. my favorite part was the loaded baked potatoes! i wasn't too fond of the bacon spinach because it was too mushy. we both couldn't finish our meal since the portion sizes are large, so we packed the rest to-go.notes: i definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time if you want to avoid a long wait. the servers are really attentive and provide good service. make sure you come here on an EMPTY stomach and do NOT fill up on the bread, that was my mistake. :)

I love this place! If you don't have a reservation, you better get to the bar before the restaurant even opens to get seats! Otherwise you're looking at an hour-half wait, not for a table, for a bar seat.The salad is amazing. The King Charles cut is the best bang for your buck. Creamed spinach is awesome and the loaded baked potato was definitely loaded. Did you know that you can get spinach AND corn? Just ask. I hear that if you finish your food, you can ask for an extra piece at no charge. I've never finished, so I wouldn't know.Hands down, a must try if you're in San Francisco!

Wonderful!!! Worth the wait.Worth the prices.Worth the traffic.As usual the House of Prime Rib does not disappoint. Impeccable service. Wonderful Prime Rib. Its been years since I have been here and I am happy to report that this restaurant is everything!!! I promise it does not disappoint. Choose whatever cut of Prime Rib you desire, City cut, house cut, English cut, etc.... Get a choice of mashed or loaded baked potato.Creamy spinach seems good...if you like that type of thing.Yorkshire Pudding is served piping hot!This has to be one of the best restaurants in S.F. as it is ALWAYS packed. Make your reservations in advance to avoid any disappointments. And of course ENJOY!!!P.S. Yes, you can bring your own wine. There is a $25.00 cork fee.And last but not least, some things never change.....If you happen to finish all your prime rib, they will offer you another piece if you dare! No one leaves here hungry, EVER!!!

Definitely the best prime rib around.The food: Excellent!I ordered the King Henry VIII Cut - the largest cut, only $3 more than the next size down AND a guaranteed bone... why not?! You can always bring the leftovers home :)Each prime rib comes with:- Spinning Salad, their house dressing is delicious!- Mashed Potatoes, yas!! (FYI I am biased and love most potatoes)- OR Baked Potato, LOADED with LOTS of bacon- Yorkshire Pudding, just ok & kind of too doughy for me... I'd avoid this - save your calories and eat more prime rib instead!- Creamed Spinach, the perfect compliment to your prime rib- OR Creamed Corn, I prefer the spinachThe service: meh.Don't get me wrong, our server was VERY nice... however, in general, everything moves pretty slowly here.... I think they need a couple more servers to keep things movingThe ambiance: hectic & crampedFrom the lounge area to the dinner area, everything seems so cramped. It's a wonder how the Prime Rib cart fits through the crowded restaurant to each table. It's also extremely noisy because everything is so close together. Parking: they have valet or you can try your luck with street parking!Reservations: a must here. They usually get booked a few months out. Especially for larger parties.Lounge: there's a lounge area where you can order drinks and wait for your table if you arrive early.

Wow! It took us 2 months to get a Saturday reservation at 4 p.m. We arrived right on time with our 2 bottles of red, and it was 5 of us.I'm telling you the corkage fees are the way to go at all restaurants now, it saves a fortune since the bottles are very over-priced at all places. I always bring a bottle or 2 wherever I go. The prime rib was the best I ever had in my life, I'm from Chicago so meat was a mainstay in our home. My dad would buy 1/2 cow and we would store it in a freezer, grass fed is the best and only way to go.Paul out waiter was excellent, he answered multiple questions about the aging process and also about Kobe which I was really interested to know.There were 4 cuts to choose from, and included a salad, creamed spinach, creamed corn, Yorkshire pudding (a must with prime ) and yummy sourdough. I like when items are not all la carte, that's when it gets really expensive. The bill was only 300.00 including a 55.00 tip. It was five of us and 4 of us split, so that's important to know... They gave my hubby a giant piece of chocolate cake because we were celebrating his 60th birthday.We are already planning our next visit, since I split mine with my daughter and I wanted more for dessert!

HOPR is always a good idea. I have finally taken the time to write a review for this wonderful establishment after dining here about 4-5 times. Let's start off by mentioning... reservations are an absolute must! You have to make resos at least one month prior to get a decent dining time. The last time I was here was on July 4th weekend, and we had reservations for 10:00pm, but really started eating at 11:00pm. The best part about HOPR is that all the sides are included (cream spinach/cream corn/mash potatoes) and guess what, YOU can get them refilled. That's only if you can even finish the portion to begin with! I usually get the California cut, medium rare.. it is absolutely delicious. In my opinion, the prime rib is better here compared to Lawry's. While I do enjoy Lawry's.. I find it slightly more salty in comparison. Back to the ribs.. it is darn juicy and very flavourful, you really can't go wrong with HOPR! Service, decor, plating... all of this is a win in my books.

Although House of Prime Rib is a bit on the pricier side, it is definitely worth it! I give them 5 stars for the whole dining experience- from the food, to the service, to the atmosphere. The service is always exceptional and the portions are always very generous. There is also valet for those who do not want to spend the time driving around looking for parking. Whenever I want to treat myself, my boyfriend and I come here. If you can make a reservation in advance, definitely do it or else you will be waiting all night! Reservations over the phone are a lot easier and seems to be more readily available than on open table. But pro tip: if you don't have a reservation come before opening and you can probably get a table within 30ish minutes.My bf always gets the King Henry cut, which is huge and comes bone-in (yay for the puppers!) and I get the House cut. Although each steak is about $45ish you get so much food! You get that beautiful prime rib, a side of either creamed corn or spinach, mashed potatoes or a baked potato, corn bread or yorkshire pudding, and also a huge complimentary salad tossed right in front of you! You also get complimentary warm bread and butter, my favorite! If you are still hungry after finishing your prime rib, they can also give you seconds! It's a smaller, thinner cut but is still delicious! You also have to finish that cut in the restaurant (they won't let you take it to go). The alcohol is also very reasonably priced! We ordered the Cosmo and the Lemon Drop for the first time the other night and the drink comes with the shaker. For $10 we basically got 3 drinks! Absolutely come give this place a try if you are ever in SF and see for yourself. I personally will be coming back, not in the near future because it hurts my wallet a bit, because I find it so darn good.

Where do I begin with this place!Fancy vintage venue, abnormally crowded even on a weekday, great prime rib. Visiting San Francisco and I was told I couldn't leave without trying this place out. My family and I made a reservation, and we were seated in about fifteen minutes. The service was part of the experience, and having someone carve my prime rib table side was very unique. The menu was organized according to prime rib cuts and meals included salad and mashed potato. My prime rib was spectacular. Perfect cut and perfect preparation - I had a medium. Overall experience was phenomenal! Great service and prime rib. Only downside is the spacing between us and the next party. When the prime rib is this good, I'll feel like a sardine any time.

Valet is $12.Be sure to make reservations 2 months ahead if you want a table especially on the weekends. This place gets so busy and packed. If you walk in around 630 on the weekends you are probably looking at a 2 hour wait minimum. You can opt to sit at the bar. They have a separate wait list. Probably shorter wait time. I got the medium rare English Cut with cream spinach and mash potatoes. Prefer the cream corn though since it not as salty as the cream spinach. The rich flavor meat was so soft and juicy. It was beyond delicious. The tender prime rib melted in my mouth!! If you finish your prime rib just ask for complimentary 2nd serving and you can ask for sides as well!! So awesome that they offer that so take advantage of it if you can eat!!My meals here are always so satisfying. Definitely still the best prime rib I've ever had! Hopefully I'll be back soon !

The best prime rib I've ever eaten, no question! The only reason this place doesn't get the coveted fifth star is because of a few weird quirks. We had a reservation and were seated in one of the back rooms immediately. The room was rather warm and EXTREMELY LOUD... really really difficult to have a conversation.. In addition, it took about 25 minutes after we ordered to be served. That isn't atypical, but considering the prime rib is sitting just feet away from you, it's a bit maddening.Those small things aside, this place is spectacular! I ordered the house cut of prime rib (medium rare) with creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. My father-in-law ordered his prime rib rare which I actually liked a bit more. It wasn't as stringy or chewy as most rare cuts but had tons of flavor. The mashed potatoes and gravy were also the best I've ever eaten in my life. My wife loved it so much she was dipping bites of her prime rib in the potatoes. The spinach and Yorkshire pudding were just average but my brother-in-law ordered the creamed corn which was excellent. We paired it with a bottle of Cabernet.And the 4oz meat refill is the perfect way to finish off that meal! I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in SF. When I do come back, I'll order the house cut rare, creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and try a dessert.

I don't think an extensive review is needed for this because it seems to speak for itself. 1) Plan in advance and make reservations. Super easy to make on opentable or just calling the restaurant itself. You may still have a short wait ---don't fret, just have a drink and relax. 2) No matter what cut you get, I don't think you can go wrong. I had the English cut, which is the thin cuts and it was amazing. Tender and flavorful beef. I drowned my food with the au jus and had no regrets. The sides were delicious as well --- mashed potatoes all the way, though the spinach wasn't too shabby either...and I hate greens. They'll even SPLIT an entree for you, which was really convenient. 3) Pricey, but it's expected because this isn't the Vegas 2AM $10 Prime Rib special. You pay for the food and the service.4) Service was stellar. Even though we came a on busy Saturday night, we never felt overlooked.MUST TRY in SF.

Ridiculously good dinner and the bartenders Jeremy and Justin were amazing (yes, no reservation, got there early and ate at the bar). Service was tremendous. The guys were swamped but carried on lively conversation and made all of us feel welcome. The prime rib killed, the sides all delicious. Mix all of this with the old world Mad Men feel and you definitely want to visit. Thank you Anthony Bourdain for listing House of Prime Rib on one of your SF destinations.

If you don't like meat, don't come here. Big chunk of meat with mash potatoes. Small extra piece of meat if you're still hungry.

Creamed corn, creamed spinach, awesome medium rare prime rib, mashed potatoes with all the toppings of a baked potato. What more can I complain about?? The house salad was tasty although extremely overdressed. They put up a good show of doing the whole spin and toss tableside which I guess was more for the entertainment value.The sourdough bread was good, though I wish the butter was slightly salted. The prime rib was definitely the star of the show. Couple that with horseradish sauce and every mouthful was perfect. I got the city cut and it was still too much food for me. PS. Make sure you check out the (not so) secret menu!Prices are pretty much what you'd expect at a fancy steakhouse. Service is excellent. And make sure you make a reservation!

Tender and delicious prime ribs! Loaded potato was really tasty, but I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes. Kinda hard to make reservation especially for weekends. Might need to make reservation month early. Totally worth the price. Lots of yummy food included in the price.

Glad I could finally cross this place off my bookmark list. I've been wanting to go forever and finally made it happen for my birthday. The prime rib is cooked perfectly, mouth still waters thinking about it. I got seconds! I ordered the baked potato for my dish and asked for it fully loaded. It was so big I took it for left overs and ate it at work next day. I really enjoyed my evening there watching the chef slice the prime rib and they sang happy birthday. Can't wait to go again.

Shoutout to our server John for making our first-time experience at HOPR so great! He was quick, attentive, easygoing, and awesome all-around. Pro tip: If you aren't completely meat-wasted by the end of your meal, you can ask for a "second helping" and they'll reload your plate with a small slice of beef. Rumor has it you can even ask for thirds, but I don't know anybody who's dared to go that far...As for the comparisons to Lawry's, I find the debate kinda silly. The nearest Lawry's is nearly 400 miles away, so if you're in San Francisco, it's not like you really have the option to go elsewhere for your prime rib fix. This place is just as good (if not better) and totally worth a visit for natives or out-of-towners alike.

Overrated. You come to HOPR for the experience. The spinning salad. The table side carving station. The great service. So what do you do after booking a reservation three weeks in advance, making an hour trip from east bay, making it early to your reservation and they stick you in a cramped corner, where a large round table is pushed up against your own where you don't even see the salad spin or the carving station table side? While on the way to being seated and upon leaving the restaurant, we were greeted by most HOPR employees, our server was slightly disappointing. A little on the slow side, and somewhat feeling ignored, the waiter could not have had more than 3 tables. HOPR seemed to be staffed well. We were at the restaurant for about 2.5 hours and not because we were enjoying our delightful company and conversation (which we were, probably the only highlight of the night), but because it seemed like it took everything forever to get to us. And then once check was paid, seemed to want to clean the table fairly quickly as I tried to finish enjoying my half glass of wine. The food is good, don't get me wrong. But you can find me over at Ruth's Chris next time I'm craving some quality red meat and a good experience. I would have enjoyed a $200+ meal much better with my friends over there. So for me, if you take away that great experience, you're left with good comparable food that will get you the 2 stars. HOPR - My second time here, and you've left me with a sour taste worse than before.

It was our first time at House of Prime Rib! My husband and I took his mom to HOPR since we've been hearing wonderful things about them! Made reservations(definitely recommended) right when we get inside the ambience was wonderful! We checked in and they informed us that someone would call our name shortly. 10 minutes passed by and we were seated, we had a lovely server inform us how everything works. Looking at the menu was short and sweet which is perfect none of the normal "oh that looks good" that makes you change your entree 10 million times. And the prices were not too bad especially the King Henry Viii cut only 3 bucks more from their medium sized. Why not just get it?! Definitely will keep coming back!! The food is most definitely one of the best tasting foods out there!!! Just don't eat too much of the bread and the salad!

I am surprised I have never been here. I heard many great things, but as a foodie I never made it to this restaurant. My sweet bf made unexpected reservations for me so that I can finally experience this place!Inside is super cute and bougie, definitely somewhere you would go eat for a special day. I mean even the waiter asked us what we were celebrating and my bf said life LOL cheers to that.Anyways, I got the City Cut, the smallest cut because no way I can eat the other big cuts. It comes with salad, mashed potatoes/baked potato, cream spinach, and Yorkshire pudding. You can get the second slice for free, but make sure you finish it because you cannot take it togo. I got my prime rib in medium rare, I am not much of a meat lover, but this was pretty darn good. Super tender and juicy! Delicious juices everywhere and even better when dipped with your Yorkshire pudding. Mashed potatoes and cream spinach was very delicious too, but can be a bit salty. The salad was good, but I think our waiter added a bit too much seasoning. Overall, this is definitely a great treat and a memorable place to eat, afterall it's been here since 1942!

Definitely an experience in total! Definitely, make a reservation in advance (by like a couple months). The only reservations leftover are at 9:30PM. It's definitely worth the wait if you have a special event or just want a good piece of prime rib.They have different cuts of prime rib and if you finish they offer you a second, smaller slice but you have to finish it at the table and can't wrap it up to take it home. The King Henry VIII's cut is the largest with bone in. You also get a few sides and a salad and bread. It's a hearty meal to say the least. But it is delicious. Highly recommend getting the meat medium rare or medium for maximum taste and flavor.They have affordable cocktails and wine, which was great to see since the meal is around $43ish dollars (without tax) per person. Everything is made/cut in front of you. The service is great and the experience is definitely a part of the taste of the prime rib. It's a place to go every once in a while as opposed to often. They offer valet at $12 per car as well if that is something you're looking to do. Don't need to arrive early for your reservation. YOu're going to be seated exactly on time, most likely. Maybe if you're special, they'll come around with the cornbread too!There is a tactic to making sure you don't eat too much. Don't indulge on the bread and salad. Wait for the meal to fully indulge- i promise it's worth it.

Great! They knock it out of the park here. That perfect old school steakhouse feeling and haven't traded anything in quality to get it. First and foremost the meat is exceptional - quality, cut, preparation, cooking, taste, presentation. The starters and presentation are all fun. Their creamed corn and yorkshire pudding aren't the best I've had but still dang awesome. I really like the salad and breads.The fantasy cake and other desserts are terrific. Service is impeccable. Bend over backwards amazing.Perfect spot for a special occasion or just a fun night out.An institution but in no way resting on its laurels or just coasting on its reputation. One thing: IT'S SO LOUD! They've got to get a noise consultant in but there were some pretty obvious, simple things they could do to reduce the noise. Surprised they haven't already addressed this. Seriously, everyone was scream talking.

Better than Lawry's? Damn right it is!Born and raised in LA, but I have to admit that House of Prime Rib blew Lawry's out of the gutter! Only complaint was that the salad was too salty because of their seasoning, but that's an easy fix.

House of Prime Rib is one of those places you have to go at least once. Everything is all fancy and the service is usually great.The steak comes with sourdough bread, salad, baked potato (or mashed), creamed corn or spinach, and Yorkshire pudding. All of this for about $50. You'll leave the restaurant feeling stuffed and satisfied! The quality of the meat speaks for itself and when you ask for it rare, they give it to you rare. Please don't shell out $50 and order your steak medium well / well done. Like cmon. Try to get a reservation at least a month beforehand. Otherwise, your only option will be to eat at like 9:30pm. If you don't mind waiting around an hour, you can just walk in and wait. They'll let you know how long the wait is when you put your name down. I actually don't mind waiting because they have a lot of seating areas where you can eat crackers and order cocktails. Warning to people who are always late: they will give your reservation away if you are late. So, either take a lyft or valet park your car so you don't end up wasting time looking for parking.

Finally tried HoPR last night and it did not disappoint!I highly recommend making a reservation unless you don't mind waiting for a table. I made a reservation about a month and a half out.Arrived at 6:30, just in time for our reservation, but we still had to wait about 10 mins to get seated.The menu is simple, choose your preferred cut of meat, how you'd like it cooked, and sides (you can choose half spinach/half corn). BREAD - a loaf of sourdough served with butter. Be sure to save room for the main course!SALAD - freshly made in front of you. Tasted fairly heavily of eggs.PRIME RIB - so deliciously tender!! If you finish your cut (anything aside from The City), you can ask for a second piece! Someone also came around midway and offered more au jus, which was a nice touch.CREAMED CORN - creamy corn, nothing to complain about.CREAMED SPINACH - tasted heavily of smoke / smoked bacon, which I was unfortunately not a fan of.Our server was very friendly and attentive in the beginning, but forgot about us towards the end, leaving us to sit there waiting for to-go boxes and the check.Bathrooms are all the way at the back of the restaurant, behind the red curtains.Overall, would definitely come back with friends and family who have never been.

One of the iconic places to check out if you're in San Francisco, this places offers a classical restaurant ambiance and service experience while specializing in prime rib. If you're coming here plan on making reservations, they do take walk ins but expect to wait at least an hour for them to fit you in. Parking here is street only and can be hard to come by so make use of the valet. The food here is good, definitely worth a try but I wouldn't say it blew me away. The food here is served with a show and excellent overall service. You choose a cut of meat and the rest of the meal is pre fixed. You get a hot and fresh mini loaf of sourdough with butter to start. For San Francisco the bread was ok. They follow the bread wth salad which they season and dress table side. Definitely different but make for a good show. The meat is cut table side from the meat zeppelin. They have a hand full of cut options, I ended up getting the house cut and it was filling. FYI they do offer an extra cut if you finish you first cut but I was way too stuffed. The prime rib is served hot with a side of au jus which is sooo flavorful. The sides you get are mashed or baked potatoes, creamed spinach, creamed corn, and Yorkshire pudding. The only one that I really liked was the mashed potatoes, the rest were ok. This place IMO is worth a try, it's a San Francisco experience. The food itself good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Not my first choice for a fancy place to eat in the city but not a bad choice. You're really playing more for the service and experience then the food here.

It's called House of Prime Rib for a reason. They really know what they're doing here. The meat was perfectly prepared, well seasoned. The side were delicious and the drinks were stiff. Our server was gracious, and patient. I would love to eat here every time I'm in SF! And I wish they would open up a location in Southern California, since nothing comes down here!

Went here last night, 3/27/17 for dinner at 8:30 PM. My husband made reservations a month ago.People, honestly, is there no decorum anymore? This is a fine dining restaurant and I saw people were wearing: busted athletic shoes, SJSU hoodies, those red dirt t-shirts that are dyed with mud. Are you serious? How gauche. Can we get an enforced dress code in here, because half the people are dressed nice enough for an evening wedding and the other half are dressed for a day at Six Flags.Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Monday. Judging by the other bad reviews, management is greedy and overbooks or understaffs this time slot. Our service was offensively slow.We were seated at a table for 2 and then every so often we'd get our waiter giving us an update on when he'd be by to take our drink and food order. This happened 3 times. "Oh just give me 2 min" "I'll be back soon" etc. It would be one thing if they were busy, but it was simply bad priority management. The table next to us was getting wine glasses refilled from the bottle on their table, a second slice of prime rib, getting their picture taken on their phones, getting free dessert for their dating anniversary, then getting another picture taken with the restaurant's camera - all before our order was taken. TAKE OUR ORDER then do all this unnecessary bs.It was more than 45 minutes between the time we sat down to the time we got our food. Our waiter said it was because other people asked for their food first from the carving guy. What? I don't know what the hold up was because the guy with his metal carving station was maybe 4 feet from us the entire time. Add to the fact that I ordered my meat "black and blue or whatever is your rarest piece" scooping out premade sides and a nearly raw piece of meat shouldn't have a hold up.Salad - overdressed and so salty. Also the waiter removed dried on salad from the plate rather than just getting another clean plate to serve us from. Yes, I noticed. After our food was dropped off, the waiter didn't come by for another hour! No water refills, nothing. He came by and asked if we were ready for boxes. I said, "I was going to ask if I could get some more au jus to finish this rib, but it's gone completely cold while waiting, so okay I guess just box it up."My husband had to inquire about getting a second slice as he had finished his King Henry VIII cut as he had finished well before the waiter stopped by.We got a free dessert (fantasy cake) & a cup of coffee because of my complaint but I'm just sick of bad, clueless service. I don't want a dessert, I just want the service that this restaurant claims to have - a fine dining experience. I've been to Lawry's, Ruth's Chris, Flemmings, and a number of fine restaurants in Vegas where I live. Texas de Brazil has better service than this - and they also serve table side meat! They're all around HoPR's price point but blow them out of the water in terms of service.For 2 entrees (King cut with creamed spinach) and water, before tip, it was $104. We were there a little over 2 hours. While the food tasted good (minus overdressed salad and horseradish sauces that were tasteless) Bad service can't be fixed by good food.

Updated review
Dirty martini was delicious The sourdough bread, corn bread, and salad they bring out before the meat are so good. It's dangerous because you fill up before the main meal. Got the English cut medium rare with mashed potatoes and cream spinach. They let us try the cream of corn and it was amazing! Next time I would definitely order that and maybe try the baked potato instead (it's huuuugggeeeee). The wine they recommended was also delicious. Service was great. Carlos was super nice and made sure our friend who has a gluten allergy was well taken care of. Second time here and just as good as the first!

My boyfriend and I came her for his birthday, two months later because it was so hard to get a reservation! It's a really good atmosphere with old leather seats and has a very classic steakhouse feel. Our reservation was at 8pm on a Thursday night (again, we couldn't get anything earlier). We got there at 7:45 and weren't seated until 8:15, so we got a drink at the bar. I had heard the martinis were popular so I got one, which was delicious! It comes in a shaker so you can continue to pour your own drinks after you've finished the first round. $13, not bad.Once we were seated, the service was great and food came out quickly. The salad was delicious and flavorful and the bread was soooo warm. I got the House of Prime Rib cut which was a lot of food. The waitress was really nice and let me try the spinach and the corn since it was my first time. I liked both a lot. I also got mashed potatoes instead of a baked potato. They were really creamy and the gravy was delicious. The meat itself was good, but I wish there was more juice on the plate. I got it medium rare, but would probably get it medium next time.Didn't try the dessert, but the tiramisu looked really good.

Overview: House of Prime Rib is an exceptionally well run, and painfully popular steak house (serving only prime rib or fish as an entree) that combines great staff, classy decor, a welcoming/casual culture, and a wonderfully gluttonous amount and variety of food for about $45-50/person (plus tax and tip).The Staff: Gregarious, entertaining (especially with the way that they mix the salads), polite, and helpful. Not as attentive as a higher class restaurant but truly excellent nevertheless.The Food: Bread - Perfectly crunchy exterior with warm, soft interior. Could have a bit more "tang" but still great.Salad - Mostly iceberg with a fun thousand-island style dressing and maybe some slices of beets. Nothing fancy but still great.Creamed Corn - Decadent, but with some off flavors that I disliked.Creamed spinach - Topped with bacon. Pretty good.Mashed Potatoes w/ gravy - Spectacular. My only complaint is that I wanted even more.Bread Pudding - Also spectacular. Wanted more.Baked Potato - Spectacular but I would get the mashed potatoes over the baked potatoes.Prime Rib - Comes in 4 variants - City = small; House/English = medium; Henry VIII = large. Medium sizes are plenty even for full grown men due to the great number of sides that are included in the $45 price. Get medium rare and it will be some of the best prime rib you'll ever have. Relatively small amount of sinew, well done salt rub on outside, and good thickness.The Establishment: This is a very large establishment that seats hundreds. It is wisely divided into several rooms and there is a nice lounge area to wait for your turn. We literally waited 2.5 hours for our dinner and it was worth it. Most of the diners here are dressed casually but the restaurant itself is quite classy with the servers all wearing formal clothing, solid wood furniture, ornate furniture and mirrors, and fireplaces. Conclusions: House of Prime Rib rocks and is my new gold standard for a steakhouse. The only problem is the wait.

4.5 stars for my first experience here! Boyfriend got reservations for 4 at 9pm on a Sunday night. I was surprised that there were people super dressed up but also people in jeans and sneakers. Idk how I felt about it lol. Right when we got there and we sat to wait for our table to be ready, waitresses were quick to ask if we wanted any drinks. I got the Cosmopolitan which was good but also came with a shaker to refill my drink like 2 more times. Definitely worth the $10! Once we were seated, our waitress for the night was very attentive and willing to help out with any questions. After that salad, I feel like I should chill all my silverware and plates lol. All of us order the House cut, med rare. It was amazing to see our Chef cut it right in front of us! It was so juicy and tender! I love the creamed corn and the baked potato. However, I didn't love the creamed spinach that I tried off of my bf's plate. I've never had Yorkshire pudding before, but I heard it was to help sop up the au jus. It wasn't for me because it had a very strong sweet, egg flavor that I didn't like with the rest of the meal. Overall it was a really great experience! Would definitely come back again for a special event

If you're a fan of prime rib then there is absolutely no reason for you not to go to the House of Prime Rib. It shouldn't even be a question of whether or not you should go. The answer is and always will be: you have to go. Making a reservation is tough so be sure to make it early. I was not very lucky because by the time I made the reservation, there was only one slot left for the day I wanted. I had made a reservation for three people at 8:30 pm. I also know that at certain places, there are sometimes cancellations so I tried calling the day of to see if anyone cancelled and ... well, no one did. So we stuck to our original time. You get what you can get right?We decided to get there a little early, around 8:00 pm to see if we would be able to get seated early. So my boyfriend and I picked up my grandma and headed over. The parking situation is a little annoying around the area but it's San Francisco so it'll be the same anywhere we go. You either find street parking or you use their valet service. We decided to use their valet service because my grandma has movement issues and it does cost $12 to use their valet service. We checked in at the hostess stand and then proceeded to wait in the lounge. The lounge was filled with people who were also waiting for their tables. They have someone that would come around calling your name when your table is ready. So in the end, we couldn't get a table early. Lesson is: just go to your reservation on time. No point in going early unless you're trying to find parking. They ended up seating us at a table that was meant for two and a third chair was put at the end for the third person. Not only that but the table itself was placed right behind another table so all in all, it felt REALLY cramped and it definitely ruined a good majority of my experience. Especially when my grandma isn't exactly in the best condition... she's a bit overweight and needs a cane to walk -- you would think that once a server or hostess sees that, they would maybe go the extra mile to get a more comfortable table for the elderly? Nope. Work is work I guess.As for the food, there is nothing that I can say that hasn't been said already. It's fantastic. Honestly, any cut you get is good. The meat is so tender, juicy, and it practically melts in your mouth. I've never had such a delicious piece of prime rib before in my life. I've dined at Lawry's before and they are really close but the House of Prime Rib definitely takes the trophy for best prime rib. Get the creamed corn, not the spinach. The spinach was really disgusting. The price is also outstanding for what you eat at this establishment. It's pretty much $60 per person if you don't get drinks. So for $60 you get a huge piece of juicy, delicious meat, two sides, bread, AND salad. Nothing can beat that, especially in the city of San Francisco. If this were a review based solely on their food then they would get 5 stars, maybe even 10. However, this review is based on my overall experience and I can't say my overall experience was stellar.Another one of the things that I did not appreciate was that on their website, it clearly states "Our Banquet room seats 20 to 70 people" but when I inquired about that, they told me that if you were to hold an event or a reception at their establishment, you will not be getting a private room. You are only able to hold it in the lounge area aka where everyone waits for their table. I talked to two different people and both people have told me the same information. So I guess they're just not the type of place to hold any special events unless you're part of the 49'ers. Now, they get a private room to themselves. I had really wanted to hold my wedding reception here but I guess that's not plausible. Overall, I would definitely come back for the food but if I were to go with my grandmother again, I guess I'll be making a few requests.

I'm shocked at all the people lining up for this place!! I've been to Lawry's in LA many times and this is almost exactly like it -- pretty good prime rib but a few things knocked the stars off this review:1. The prime rib cuts were VERY uneven. 3/5 people on our table got the same cut and my mom got a good sized cut, whereas my husband and father got a significantly smaller cut. Their cut was BARELY bigger than the smallest cut that I had ordered. I understand the "chef" is eyeballing it, but you really don't have to have THAT much skill to make sure you're giving people similar amounts.2. The meat was NOT amazing. When I think of prime rib, I'm expecting soft, tender, melt in your mouth texture -- like a slab of meat butter. I got a flavorful piece of meat but the texture was gritty ... almost like a flat iron steak. Very unimpressed. My father also had the same comment about his prime rib.3. Our waiter disappeared at the end of the meal. We were sitting there for a good 15-20 minutes waiting for our check. Don't you want to rush us out so the next party can get seated? It seems they have one server per so many tables, and each server has to cater to everything like the salad making, york pudding distributing, baked potato filling ... maybe designate someone to go around and check on the tables if they need to-go boxes and/or the check!!I can't believe the reservations can go 1-2 months out ... that's crazy to me. I'm not sure if our family got a bad batch but I won't be coming back. One and done for me. I'll be getting my prime rib somewhere else.

This place was busy even at 9 pm. Although my friend made a reservation, all your party has to be there. I order house of prime rib cut, medium, and with side dish of cream spinach and mash potatoes for the price of $43.85. Quite expensive but you're paying for what you get. Anyways, this piece of cut was very tender and juicy. The server bring salad before we get the main course. The dressing had a lot of flavor which made the salad tastes good. Also they bring out different kind of breads too before your main dish.They bring out this silver heater thing that has the meat and side dishes. They have a chef who cut the meat close by your table. But we had to wait more than 20 minutes until they bring the heater of meat to our table since it was busy and they had a list of orders of which table to go next.The inside of this place looks almost old school/maybe victorian styleThe waiter that my table got was friendly and attentiveThis place can get loud if your table is next to a large table who talk very loud that you can't hear people from your own tableUsually a lot of people come here for special occasion.

HOPR never disappoints. I have dined here multiple times and my take away everytime is that both food and service here is consistently excellent. I most recently came here on a Friday night (reservation booked in advance via Opentable) and unfortunately was not able to find parking. Luckily they offer valet parking for $12! We were seated immediately and Justin, our server for the night, was both attentive and amusing. The meal begins with bread + butter and their house salad which is prepared at your table. I shy away from eating too much because the salad alone will fill me up! We ordered the house of prime rib cut with mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and Yorkshire pudding. The sides pair perfectly with the prime rib which is cooked to perfection. We finished off the meal with tiramisu, my favorite dessert! The tiramisu tastes fresh and I believe it is made in house. HOPR truly lives up to expectations and I always pay a visit when I'm in the mood for amazing prime rib!

House of Prime Rib is a San Francisco institution. The second you walk in, you're completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of people packed into this place! The decor is reminiscent of an elegant steakhouse with red booth seating and elegant arm chairs, and the service and choreography were definitely highlights of the restaurant! I came here with a group of seven for my birthday dinner and had a fantastic time--so glad we had a reservation, because there were a ton of people waiting for tables!The menu here is nothing if not simple--you pick the size of your cut of meat, the temperature, baked or mashed potato, and spinach or corn. Once you sit down, you're started with huge round loaves of crusty, crispy sourdough bread, and the bread lovers in my group of friends could not help but ask for more and more! We also got sticks of cornbread, and then comes the house salad, which is mixed table side. At the core of it, it's pretty simple--iceberg lettuce, creamy dressing, and vinaigrette, finished with a spicy kick of black pepper. Nice!And then come the entrees--the beef is sliced from huge carts right in the dining room, and this is a beautiful sight for hungry carnivores. I got the English cut, which the normal-sized prime rib, but sliced into three thinner pieces. The beef was juicy and very, very tender, though perhaps not the best quality I've had from a nice steakhouse. The creamed spinach was absolutely (and guiltily) delicious--it had chunks of bacon that gave it a deep, savory flavor. The corn and Yorkshire pudding were also good, and the baked potato came with sour cream, chives, and bacon bits on the side--nothing crazy, but tasty!If you finish your first piece of meat, you can have a thin slice as seconds on the house! Two of my friends actually went for this despite being full, but definitely no regrets! After such a fun, well-choreographed dinner service, the waiters brought out a scoop of ice cream with a candle and sang the most beautiful "Happy Birthday" I've heard from restaurant staff! Overall, while the food here was decent, it definitely wasn't the best I've had from a nice steakhouse, but the service is THE reason to come. This is absolutely the place to celebrate a special occasion, and you will not be disappointed by how well you're treated! You even get a free souvenir photo at the end to memorialize your visit!

Got the English Cut prime rib, as did everyone else in our group. Chose the mashed potatoes and they were so creamy and good. The prime rib was DELICIOUS. Cooked to perfection and served in a manner, table-side, that did the price plenty of justice. It was very ambient with regards to lighting and overall feel, but rather lively and noisy. Not ideal for a quiet romantic dinner. Definitely a place to go with family and friends and leave with less functioning buttons on your pants. Just wear maternity pants (guys too) and you'll leave a little more comfortably.

What's there not to like? The beef is top grade and comes out fast! The cuts of beef from King to English caters to all degrees of hunger. The salad, the sides, and the presentation just makes your mouth water in anticipation!English cut is my preferred choice because I can still walk out the front door feeling full without the food coma. The ambiance has a real cozy and old English vibe, a subtle fireplace, and warm wood throughout.I would give it a slight edge over Lawreys, but you really can't go wrong with either...just depends where you are/live.

HOPR is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco and IMO the best prime rib restaurant I've ever visited.I like that it's divided into several rooms with elegant decor. Unlike the vast open caverns of other restaurants, the warm feelings I've always experienced here make me want to return every time I'm in the Bay Area.I've been going to HOPR for over 30 years. My favorite host, Gus Stathis, has retired. But the great food and ambiance remains. I only went there once without a reservation. While it was a log wait I passed it by at the bar chatting with other customers and tourists. I hope to return there soon.

I cannot say that I am a prime rib expert, nor am I so into meat in general, but I do like this place. It's definitely a go-to spot for many who are celebrating something special. I think for me, I just don't care too much about meat enough to recognize its true excellence. It's definitely tender and has great juices. I also like that their menu has many different choices for different appetites. The salad is not something you can forego. Order it because the presentation is nice and it balances the heaviness of the meal. I have yet to try the bread pudding, but I heard it's great with the juices. The cream of spinach and corn are good choices for sides, but a good baked potato with the works is always my choice. It's an SF icon; I would recommend it and come if I was in the mood for a prime rib.

They really take care of you here. From the moment you walk in, you're treated like a rock star.And for the price you pay for your prime rib price, you get so much food that includes creamed spinach, mashed potatoes or baked, creamed corn and a salad. And the salad was one of my favorites. Love the sauce.And as for the prime rib, it was nice and juicy. Loved it and will come back.Pretty decent selection on dessert too. I went with the English trifle and it wasn't too filling either. Just enough to not pass out until you leave the restaurant.

It doesn't get much better than HOPR. We made our reservations ahead of time and when we came they seated us right away. Immediately we were brought fresh and delicious sourdough with butter. We ordered a bottle of pinot noir which was really tasty for the price. At this point we are super hungry and soon enough our salad arrives, where they mix it for you at the table. Feels very old fashioned but just lean into it! After we devoured the crispy AF salad, we are brought the rest of the meal. Hot damn, is that prime rib good... I ordered the regular cut and my two companions both ordered the largest- King Henry. They barely made it through but I had no problem finishing mine. The mashed potatoes and spinach were my sides- both fabulous, paired well with the meat- and the yorkshire pudding was really great dunked into the gravy.Our server saw us sharing sides and in a really nice gesture he brought us out extra sides so we wouldn't have to share. It is so rare to get service like that! When we had trouble deciding between two desserts (bread pudding or tiramisu) we went with one and then he brought out the other for us as well (at no charge). Needless to say, we were really impressed that he went above and beyond (and his tip definitely reflected that). I loved my experience here. Will be happy to go back next time I'm SF.

HOPR is about serious serious meat. I mean these guys don't f around. Let me start with the bad. The one and only bad thing about this place is getting a reservation. We called them and they said they're booked a month in advance (keep reading to find out why). The walk-in line starts at 4pm (I'm not that old yet). But we got lucky and checked with OpenTable randomly and managed to find a table for 6:30p which I think is a good time to eat massive amounts of meat.Ok here's the good. The menu is super simple and the quality of the food is amazing. Big, juicy prime rib with Au Jus and two sides. Although I wasn't as excited about the mashed potato, the creamed spinach was heavenly. The little tiny bits of bacon added amazing flavor and texture that you otherwise wouldn't expect. At the end, we got two big portions of salad, prime rib, two generous sides, and Yorkshire pudding for $44 pp. Oh and if you manage to finish your first plate, you get a second one for free. Can I hear a Moooooooo?? Praise the cow. Just to add, if you're into gnawing on some rib bones, you can just ask and they'll give you one. Yes I know, not very classy but it's just so damn good.I'd definitely recommend this place and can't wait to return.

This place lives up to its hype.This is likely a reiteration of all the great things already listed, but in short, their prime rib is succulent, mouth-watering, so amazingly soft, but just the amount of tenderness. The sauce adds just the right amount flavor that doesn't take away from the prime rib. Their prices of $40-$50 prime ribs are justified. A salad was provided also, I didn't care for it personally, just tasted like Italian dressing.The customer service was great though! Paul was personable and attentive! Would recommend! Reservations necessary!

This has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. The pricing is decent, the service is always great, and they have valet so you don't have to deal with the crazy city street parking! I love how their menu is the most simplest thing. You just choose your desired cut / cook of meat and the side you prefer. THE SALAD IS MY FAVORITE!I always get the city cut w/ mash, little bit of creamed spinach and corn, and the au jus on the side -- and it's the perfect portion! Personally, I am not a fan of the horseradishes, so plain ol Tabasco is good enough for me! I wish this place was closer to us, because I know we would definitely come here a lot more but for now special occasions will do! I highly recommend this place!

I have yet had the opportunity to make a review this wonderful restaurant. This restaurant definitely represents what they're good at. The prime rib was phenomenal, no prime rib have I ever eaten can compare. Extremely nice restaurant to take a nice date to if you're trying to indulge on a huge prime rib steak! The only disappoint I had was not with the food or service, it was more of having to wait an hour even with a reservation. I do understand this is a very busy restaurant but reservation times should be honored or with a minimal wait time of 15 minutes.

Managed to snag a reservation for 4 on a Friday night the week of. Showed up at 6:30PM and we were seated immediately. Started off with the salad which was excellent. Requested only half the dressing be poured in and that was plenty. My friend mentioned that last time they poured all the dressing in and it was too much.I ordered the house of prime rib cut medium rare. The piece was thick, juicy and plenty of meat. Healthy amount of cream spinach and mashed potatoes also. I think this was the perfect amount of food because as I was finishing it, all the au jus sauce was gone and the food was starting to get cold since there was so much. We paired the prime rib with the malbec, which made the meat taste slightly sweeter. The seconds was substantially thinner, probably 1/5 of the size. Same amount of mashed potatoes and cream spinach though. Make sure to get half / half. It is the full amount of cream spinach and a side of corn. The name seems to imply you get less cream spinach, but that is definitely not the case. The corn is sweet and my whole group loved it. I also really liked the cream spinach. soft and not too creamy. HOPR has the thickest piece of prime rib I've ever had and this is truly how prime rib is meant to be enjoyed. Can't believe I've waited all this time to try this place

This was my first visit to HOPR and it was delightful from the moment I stepped inside. The ambiance was warm and cozy and the service at the bar was good. We didn't wait very long to be called for our table and once there, the goodies began. The hot sourdough bread was delish and so was the salad, made right in front of us. Our server was younger and full of jokes, which was fun. I got the English cut (thin slices) which was about 45 dollars and it came with a side of potato, either mashed or baked....also the option of cream of corn or cream of spinach. If you don't finish ur meal, you can get the leftovers to take home in a doggie bag. AND If u we're still hungry, you could even get seconds!!! This was REALLY REALLY delicious food for a solid price. Overall, their service could have been a little more elegant but the food was on point and the experience was pretty magical!!
