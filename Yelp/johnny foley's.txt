A friend of mine was craving fish and chips. We decided to go to Johnny Foley's since it's close to my work. We had a party of three, but two of us showed up on Wednesday, September 20th around 5:45pm. We had no problem grabbing a four top, even though our friend showed up about 30+ minutes later.*Mussels in Irish Whiskey Cream Sauce with Bacon, Garlic & Parsley ($16)*Foley's Seafood Chowder with Chives ($9)*Foley's Fish & Chips, Fresh Cod in Lager Batter: mushy peas, lemons, house-made tartare sauce ($19)*Bangers & Mash, Two Plump Pork Sausages: mashed potatoes, stewed onions, seasonal vegetables, gravy ($19)*Guinness Stout ($8.75) x3*Guinness Blonde Lager ($8.75) x2*Prosecco, Caposaldo, Italy, n/v ($12 glass)*Jameson 18 ($22.75)*Irish Coffee ($11.50) x4I honestly was more about the drinking than the eating. I ended up having a glass of bubbly, two beers, two irish coffees, and a Jameson neat. I'd never had a guinness blonde lager, so it was fun trying that as I like lighter beers. The Irish coffees were good and not too sweet. (I asked our server to make mine less sweet.) I love soup, so I enjoyed the seafood chowder. It was creamy, had a good amount of seafood, and not too rich as I tend to like a lighter broth. I tasted the rest of the dishes and thought they were pretty good. The boys seemed to enjoy them.I used to come to Johnny Foley's a lot about a decade or more ago as I had a coworker who adored this place. It was fun coming back and revisiting a place I hadn't been to in a long while. I know they have dueling pianos, but unfortunately they weren't here that night. Maybe I'll come back to check that out. I do have fond memories of a dueling piano bars.

"Time For a Pint!" reads the sign above clock at the corner of O'Farrell St. & Cyril Magnin St. This San Francisco icon almost says it all. I write "almost" because you get so much more than a pint at Foley's. You see, at Foley's you get a San Francisco institution, tradition, an experience uniquely Johnny Foleys.The moment you walk through the door, you feel the warmth of the Irish. And this place is cavernous so making a body feel warm is no easy feat. But that's what you get at my favorite bar and restaurant in SF.First, the staff is stellar. The bartenders know how to pour a proper Guinness as well as shake a perfect Martini. This is my favorite bar in the city and it's due to the bartenders. They are professional in their white shirts and dark ties but they can also be playful and fun, especially with the locals. From behind the gloriously ornate wooden bar, you'll hear charming brogues, witness the spectacle of a mad flurry of activity, and be served a beverage that is sure to refresh and revive. These guys are the best, bar none! And they're dishy. Speaking of dishy, let's talk food.The food is seriously superb. Recently, O, my spouse and I were staying at Bartlett's Bunkhouse just across the street. Over the course of our stay, we had three suppers at Foley's and all servings were beautifully plated and more importantly lip-licking delicious. It's near impossible for me to order anything other than Foley's cottage pie so I'm not surprised I had it two out of three meals. For my taste and from my exposure to cottage pie in SF, Foley's pie simply can't be beaten. On our final night, O and I both had one of the night's specials: grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes. The chops were thick and juicy with grill marks so perfect and pristine in their geometry, they looked painted on. I'm a gravy guy, my Texas roots, I guess, so I was disappointed to see a towering serving of potatoes sans gravy. But after one bite, I was missing gravy no more!Another night, O had clam chowder. Wow! Until then, our go-to place for clam chowder was a great little place in the Castro but now, we're not so sure which is best. They should call it Foley's Chunky Clam Chowder. The Foley's atmosphere is festive and friendly. It's the kind of place you can engage with the stranger next to you who might be a local or a visitor from another country. The place is welcoming and downright familial, so much so it provides the perfect environment to either chat with your neighbor or to enjoy a solitary moment with your journal.Visually, it's a wonderland if, like me, you're seduced by old-warm charm. Be sure to take it all in from the floor to the ceiling and everything in between. Mona Lisa with a Guinness mustache? You betchya!Many thanks to our warm friends at Foley's who took such great care of us during our stay. We hope to see you all again very soon. Cheers! And GO BULLDOGS!

Came here on a Friday night and was extremely happy to get a table almost right after getting there. The dueling pianos show is incredibly fun to watch. If you request a song, make sure you put more than $10 if you want to hear it. We put $5 and didn't hear our song in the 3 hours we stayed there. It makes sense considering some people were paying $40 to hear their songs though. The drinks are rather expensive. They're good if you order a specialty drink because those are big. But if you order a basic "vodka soda" or something of that sort, it's really not worth it. Great experience. But keep in mind there's a $10 cover. Definitely pregame and then come here. Not worth it to try to get drunk at Johnny Foley's. Oh and to the pianists...excellent work! You guys rock.

We came here on a Saturday night for a group dinner, but were the first ones here. Luckily, we were able to head over to the bar to grab some drinks and hang around the bars before the rest of the party arrived. This place is huge with two bars and a live band. The six of us were seated in a table within a mini room, which provided some nice privacy. The server was also great about checking up on us through the dinner despite us being hidden away.Each couple in the group shared, so we decided on three appetizers for two (which thankfully we did, because the portions aren't much): Grilled Baby Back Ribs with Habanero-Roasted Vegetable Salsa ($17), Grilled Bacon-Wrapped Prawns with Sweet Chili Chutney ($16), and Pan-Fried Dungeness Crabcakes ($20). Each plate came with their own version of salad, which was pretty interesting. I enjoyed the salad paired with the baby back ribs the most as it was more of a coleslaw. As for the appetizers itself, the crabcakes lacked flavor even with the sauce and you only get two pieces; the bacon-wrapped prawns were glazed for this sweet, spicy taste that was delicious yet you only get two skewers with three pieces each; the ribs came in six bones, but dry and flavorless as well. The ribs really should've been paired with some good ol' barbeque sauce instead of the salsa.Overall, the food is not only pricey, but it sucks and come in small portions. There is nothing I would order again, unfortunately. Although service was consistent on checking up on us, they did mess up our order when we added one of our cards that was on tab. At least we got a free brownie for the birthday boy in the end.

Johnny Foley's is an Irish Pub located near Union Square. Our large party was accommodated very quickly and without a reservation. They have great options on the menu for everyone, which was a welcome relief to everyone. They have a mushroom ravioli which I ordered with added shrimp. It was a little on the bland side, and the portion was small, but it was okay. They also had another vegetarian option that another member of my party ordered. Everytime seemed to enjoy their meals. They had a live band playing music and the bar was fairly packed. Overall, nice choice if you're looking for Irish fare.

Came here for dinner with my guy. We shared the chicken and a few sides. Chicken was a little dry but the gravy was delicious. Veggies and mashed potatoes were good as well. Side of roasted Brussels sprouts were very tasty. My favorite was probably the Irish cheddar Mac and cheese. Highly recommend.

Cool atmosphere and good food. They have live bands some nights. We stopped in for dinner before a concert because it was near our hotel. The staff was so friendly they convinced us to come back after the concert for the band. We did and it was a blast! 80's cover band was fantastic, bartender made us drinks we gave him recipe for. The kitchen closes at 10:00 though so if you want late night food this is not the spot!

This review is for the downstairs piano bar only:This place is a great time! Arrive early if you want to grab a seat because the room gets crowded on weekends after 9pm. The pianists are talented entertainers, and better singers than I expected. And by the time I left there was a crowd of people on the dance floor.The age range here is pretty broad and there were some very entertaining older people cutting a rug with the rest of them. Songs also ranged from Brittney Spears to Elvis. A little something for everyone. One warning- if you want to request a song when it's busy and you only give them $5, your song may never be played. The crowd we were in was forking over $20 per song request, and even up to $40 for one. This may vary by night, and is the way dueling piano bars go, but was disappointing for me since they never got to my song.

We decided to try this it out because we were all starving after flying and it was a short walk from our hotel. It has a great pub atmosphere with possibly a lot of original decor from decades past, including one of the coolest bars I've ever seen!My beef Guinness soup was delicious. It's a pretty sizeable portion that you could almost make a meal out of by itself. I also had the fish and chips, which were good, but nothing special. It looked like they have a decent tap selection, but I'm expecting and unfortunately couldn't try any of it. Our service was great. A downside is that it's pretty pricey for what you get, especially considering that we went for lunch, which is usually cheaper. I spent about $40 including tip, which wouldn't have been too bad if a drink or two was on the tab as well. Welcome to San Francisco!

I came here on a Sunday night for a late dinner. The place was pretty crowded with young professionals. A live band was playing and people were enjoying their drinks and dancing. I sat in one of the booths. It was a good spot to people watch and enjoy my food. Once the band started it was a little loud and I had trouble hearing the conversation. Luckily, the music the band was playing was great so I did not mind too much!For dinner I ordered two things off of the appetizer menu. I had the grilled tandoori style chicken skewers and curry fries. Both were delicious. They were not quite what I would expect to find at an Irish pub and restaurant but good nonetheless. The chicken was well cooked and very flavorful. It came with a cucumber dipping sauce which was tasty! The curry fries were good as well. They were thick cut and a little less crispy than I would normally like, but the curry made up for it. The fries were covered in a mildly spicy yellow curry sauce. I had never had curry fries before and I was very pleased.Overall, a great place to grab a bite to eat or a drink. The bar itself seemed like a good place to enjoy music and have some fun dancing with friends!

In the heart of downtown S.F. it can be overwhelming to find a place to eat. There are many good choices, but which one? We were in such a dilemma on a recent Saturday. Then we saw a sign for an Irish pub, Johnny Foley's.A beer and menu choices that go beyond basic pub grub sounded perfect. The prices were pretty reasonable for this touristy location. The place is bigger than it first appears, which means we got a table without a wait!Be forewarned, its a bit loud and there are many TV's to watch the Warriors play. Aside from that the atmosphere has cozziness to it. We were tempted by several choices on the menu: the cottage pie, fried chicken, the soups, corned beef and cabbage, and so on. We settled on some seafood chowder to share, the fried chicken, and bangers and mash. The chowder was rich and tasty without being too salty. The entrees were very generous. Each had a deliciously smooth mound of mashed potatoes with a rich and plentiful gravy. I hate it when there isn't enough gravy. No worries of that at Johnny Foley's. There's plenty of flavorful gravy. The fried chicken was a full boneless breast and a thigh piece with a light crisp skin and crisp coleslaw. The bangers had a smooth grind and snappy casing that was really tasty. Everything was delicious and we really appreciate the talent of the kitchen that didn't just relied on salt to flavor the food. The food was good all by itself with salt to accent. The beers were great too. We just wished our stomachs were bigger, because we were so very very full. So if you're in the neighborhood looking for a place with good value and good food stop looking at menus and just stop here.

I visited this place with friends to try out the Irish coffee. They had very few vegetarian options on the menu. We ordered chilly fries along with the drinks. The fries were okayish and we felt that maybe we should have ordered garlic fries. The Irish coffee was strong and good.I loved the overall ambience of the place. They had a big screen showing live Oscar Awards that night. Overall, it was a really nice place to chill with friends.

In one word - 'mehFirst impression was that it was cute. But I was turned off by the sight of stacks of "Bud Light" glasses. I know that the beer people provide free glasses, but.... this is an irish pub, right? Put them on the other side of the bar or under the bar. It was late, I was hungry. I stayed. I must have been so hungry that I missed fish and chips on the menu (I see it online, though) so I got a Tuna Melt and a Guinness Blonde Lager. Was pleased to see that the beer didn't come in a Bud Light glass. Again I was hungry, but I don't think that the beer was served quite cold enough. Was happy they had the Blonde Lager, though!The tuna melt was GINORMOUS. Seriously a huge sandwich. Came with a mixed green salad on the side (you could change it for something else, I was happy with the non-iceberg salad). There wasn't a lot of cheese on it, but it was tasty. It was so big that I had to opt out of most of the bread so that I could eat the entire tuna portion. Was pleased that they had mixed greens on it, rather than boring iceberg.I'd like to think I would have been happier with fish and chips. My bad for missing that on the menu.

Lots of different kinds of beer on tap and quick service. We ordered some snacks to calm down the alcohol intake and had a great time meeting people from all over the USA. Lots of older adults but I did see some kids eating with their parents. Place was clean for it being so crazy busy. Will definately go again.

This is now my favorite Irish bar in San Francisco. It's always lively, the style of the pub is very typically Irish, and the food is good. There are usually bands that play here nightly, with a variety of different music styles. The menu is traditional Irish style. It's got the usual shepherds pie, bangers and mash. Also has good appetizers. Have to say though that the prices really surprise me at times. Drinks are expensive, even by SF standards. Also the food is pricey. The highlight is the Guinness though- the best in the city.

Stopped in here for a quick beer upon arriving in the city for my mini vacation. Right in the heart of Union Square, this is one of those old school Irish bars where you can get a cold (and I mean cold!) one amidst tourists and regulars alike. Bartender was attentive. Prices are probably better at happy hour, but I was early and paid $6 for a Coors Light. Not bad considering you are in one of the most expensive cities in the world. Perfect stop to wet my whistle and move on down the road!

This pub is conveniently located close to Union Square. We went there on a Saturday and still got good seating for a large group. There was no air conditioning or fan or anything and it was super hot inside. When we asked the waitress if there is some AC unit, she just got rude and told us that she herself is wearing a tie. We had one drink there and left since the heat was unbearable. There was a live rock band there which was playing nice music and people were dancing in that little area. I feel like this place can do a lot better with their service since they already have a great location.

An Irish Bar in San Francisco! Is that Backstreet Boys playing? Yes, yes it is. When I spent a week in Ireland they played a lot of "american" music, songs that we forget about, generally dislike but will definitely sing along to. The music here was like my Shazam download history from 1990. Lots of beer on tap here, I love at least one warm beer like a Kilkenny and then I'm off to the cold races. Our Kilkenny pints were very full, and served in real pint glasses. The food was really expensive and not that great. I had just walked over from Masterchef tryouts and after staring and tasting some really good dishes and this place fell flat on it's culinary kilt. My fish and chips was three pieces of battered fish served a top a pile of chips, or frozen fries. Barely crisp and mush in the middle I mentioned this to my waitress when she said they made the best fish and chips. The fish was okay, tasted fresh at least. She was very friendly but never offered to bring a fresh batch that was actually cooked.I'd give it 3 stars, 4 for the beer, 3 for the service and 2 for the food. Hopefully it was just an off day.

This place is absolutely fantastic. I had never heard of it, but a friend who was visiting from Chicago found it online, so we decided to check it out. We went to the Dueling Pianos in the downstairs cellar, and it was equal parts fun and hilarious. They have a one-out-one-in policy at the door, but we only had to wait for about five minutes. The music downstairs was absolutely terrific--it's all requests driven, and the pianists can play just about everything! I was surprised to find that there was a pretty packed dance floor. It took a bit to get a table, but it was never overcrowded. The drinks were delicious, and the prices weren't much more than you'd expect from your average SF bar. The decor is awesome--especially the dark red wallpaper-- and the bathrooms were clean and well-decorated as well. We came to Johnny Foley's expecting to get some drinks but end our night elsewhere, but we had such a fun time, we ended up sticking around for last call. It was a fun, welcoming space, and I can't recommend it enough!

Came here in May 2015. NOTE: I only tried the drinks here. I give this place 1 star for the service at the bar. The first bartender did not know how and/or refused to make any drinks that were not on the menu. A second bartender came over to fulfill our "custom" drink orders. He was a little too confident about about his drink-making skills. However, the drinks he made us did not live up to his claim. They both tasted like sours, which was not what we wanted. The service along with the drinks definitely left a bad taste in my mouth, and I do not plan on coming back here.

Imagine you are in one of the best food cities in the world with your teenage son. This is where he wants to go for his birthday dinner. So we went. The portions are way too big, which I suppose justifies the price but only if you want a huge amount of food or you split one thing. The food is fine. The onion straws a the best item we had. It was too loud, which made the server not hear what my son ordered a brought the wrong thing. Not at all worth the trip if you are looking for go food while visiting the city.

Their steak however was okay, I've certainly had much better as this one didn't have a lot of zest to it but it was decent. Their mashed posts were tasty though with a nice kick of garlic to them and the gravy was fabulous!!!! Ended dinner with their strawberry cheesecake for dessert and it was pretty bad!

The food is relatively expensive and some of the portions for the entrees are not worth the price (i.e. Wild mushroom ravioli). Nonetheless, I visit this place every time I'm in downtown SF. Fish and chips are very good and large portion. The wild mushroom ravioli is very garlic-Y and I was still hungry after I finished the plate. The cottage pie is delicious and more filling. Overall, I would recommend this place to catch up with friends over some beers. Service is quite slow when it's crowded.

Sorry, can't do 5 stars which would be maybe deserved because of their (ahem) "policy"I'm solo at a table for 3. A lovely older couple is at the bar, one seated at the only seat and one standing. I try to swap ... And management tries to kick them out because they don't have a "reservation"Needless to say I reclaimed my table so they were not kicked out... (Might have helped that I hadn't paid my tab yet)KC waitress is first rate best ever! Many good brews on tap. They have some lessons to be learned on customer service ... And I'm glad I had the trump card of an open tab

I pass by this place on a daily basis but never go in. There is usually a crowd outside and it looks pretty touristy. I also see that they have the Dueling Pianos her, which is a reason for their popularity.I came here with coworkers to celebrate her last day on the job. It seemed like a good venue that was large enough to accommodate a large group, and there is no cover.Likes:-Plenty of seating and standing area-Food options if you come early enough-Pretty decent draft selection-Live music! The band playing when I went was lively, fun, and got the crowd dancing.-Dueling Pianos on certain nights-Central location. Right next to 38 stop and close to Bart/MuniDislikes:-EXPENSIVE. $8-9 for draft beer not including Tax! $14 for a signature cocktail. Absolutely ridic prices.-Gets packed quickly.-Crowd can be hit or miss. It was super touristy and several men kept trying to impress me when I clearly was not impressed by them.It's maybe a fun stop if you're having a night out, but with the prices, I could not imagine going for more than 1 drink here before wanting to move onto the next bar where I can get a drink for half the price.

We received great service, and all the food came promptly and was delicious. These place does their potato skins better than any other place I have ever been to.

We have been coming here for years, and the food and service is consistently good quality. I've had many items on the menu, the Cottage Pie, corned beef and cabbage, steak sandwich and even the tuna melt, and the quality of the food does not disappoint. They pour the best Guinness in California! Appetizers are also fantastic, wings, potato skins. I highly recommend trying Johnny Foleys when in Union Square.

Outstanding service and delicious food. I came here just to get a salad. My friend and I decided to split the Irish Lamb Stew. It was the best ever. So tender and flavorful. I highly recommend. Odd thing was our salad was served at the same time as the main meal. Other than that amazing.

Food was hearty and plentiful. I loved the fact the menu included Indian food since a pub "back home" would include those as well. A good mix of Irish fare and American. Americanized pub grub to appeal to just about anyone. If you want more "authentic" Irish foods, um, go to Ireland.Expect to wait (20-30 mins) since the place is popular and good location. Service isn't 4-star but staff is friendly and the crowds keep them hustling.We brought visiting family and they were happy. Good experience overall.

A bit pricey, but portions were large and food was delicious. Server was not friendly at all, and she seemed aggravated our entire meal. But this is a great place to grab some drinks and great food!

Go for the dueling pianos night because it's a ridiculously fun time. They play crap music until you tip them. The performers offer a lot of crowd engagement.

Wandered here on the recommendation from our uber driver. Best Bloody Mary I've ever had and I'm basically an alcoholic after last weekend.

Came here with my family for dinner. Staff were very accommodating especially for a large party. Since it's a pub/restaurant, it is quite noisy so nothing out of the ordinary here. Good selection of beers and other drinks. Food was delightful. I had the fried chicken. Was gonna try the corned beef hash, but was gonna have corned beef the following day so I thought I'd try something else. Would come back if around the area.

Best fish and chips I've had in a long time. Great atmosphere, staff. Coming back later tonight for the nightly music.

The food was worth 5 stars and MOST of the staff was very kind and helpful an happy. BUT our server was NOT good. I work in a restaurant and am a server myself so I understand the stress of serving. Our server didn't introduce herself, didn't smile, didnt appreciate us as guests and my friends and I felt unwanted. When the bills came she LOOKED in the books to see for cash or card. And make it seem she wasn't giving us change. Then, when we did get change she gave incorrect change. Only a small amount she missed but it's the moral behind it not the amount we were missing.

Can't speak much on food as I go there for drinks - have gotten the calimari and it was how calimari should be.Drinks? Decent pricing. Service? Great. The environment is friendly and often packed so grabbing attention may take a few minutes longer.-1 star to the socially awkward tall and lanky security guy with glasses. Was being semi rude to us and other customers when he was carding them (the ones he did card).A couple walked in front and he opens the door for them right away, when it got to us he asked us for card. Sometimes they ask sometimes they don't depending the event and who's out there. He rambled about the under 40 look CA carding... Yeah that couple in front of us were definitely not in their 40's. We get it. We don't have blond hair and blue eyes.

Nice nice place! Food is great ! I really enjoyed my night here with my coworkers. We all ordered steak. Prices are ok, I would say fair. I would definitely want to come back and try something else.

We stopped in for a quick lunch while waiting for our hotel room check in. Great location close to Union Square and traditional Irish Pub setting. The food is very good and the staff super friendly!

Expect a wait! When I heard it would be up to an hour I was ready to walk out but then I heard an accent. Irish accents are so sexy. I had to do a u turn and go tot he bar. Packed pretty tightly by the bartenders gave girls prior attention, so we ordered for the guys next to us and they covered the tab! :-) Great Irish pub and lovely piano bar. One of those places where you feel strange as hell to order wine unless you're a 21 year old girl. And by the time you down the wine there's someone offering you an IPA - I mean you're an adult at a pub do it right. Food was just a skip past okay (salmon and wild ravoli) but the service, music, decor and ambiance was top notch. Extremely spacious bar but still has that neighbor small vibe. I had re-watched Far and Away before visiting. So raise your pint and enjoy yourself. Kilkenny, Guinness, Karp and Murphy's (in that order). Expect to hear some profanity from a few smiling faces.

Looking for a piano bar? Come to this one! It has a very lively and fun crew that keeps you laughing (and tipping) with their songs. The upstairs food area isn't bad either but it's more of a tourist spot since it's close to the Powell BART stop. Just come for the dueling experience!
