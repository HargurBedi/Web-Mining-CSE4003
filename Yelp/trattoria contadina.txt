The ambiance here is as good as it gets for sure! Come here with friends or coworkers -- you'll definitely have a great time. Additionally, the surrounding area is lovely.Stand-out dishes (as good as it looks/sounds):*Caprese: burrata, kumato tomatoes, basil, balsamic reduction ($13)Delicious! The burrata amplifies the dish. Great balance of flavors.*Roasted bell pepper: asiago, mozzarella, bel paese, spicy tomato cream ($14)Usually not a fan of bell pepper, but the warmness*Carlesimo: rigatoncelli, pancetta, porcini, peas, sun-dried tomatoes, spicy tomato cream ($21)There's a kick to it! Absolutely loved the sun-dried tomatoes with the rigatoncelli.*Gnocchi | ricotta dumplings | asiago | tomato cream ($19)Probably my favorite pasta on the menu. It's DELICIOUS. Great gnocchi.Bonus points for amazing waiters/waitresses.

We walked in 15 minutes before closing and were immediately seated for a lovely dinner. Our waiter was wonderful, attentive & hilarious (brownie points when you refill our water without us hunting you down). I started with the Rose wine which was spectacular!!Followed by the Gnocchi which felt like ultimate comfort food. The sauce was so good I could have just had a bowl of it with bread and been satisfied! Gnocchi stuffed with ricotta made a nice contrast with the sweetness of the sauce.My husband had the rotini with pancetta and sun dried tomatoes which he inhaled! Overall great experience & delicious food!!!

Love this little local trattoria in beautiful North Beach. Real Italian ambiance with cable cars ringing their bells right outside. We started with the bruschetta, carpaccio and a Cesare to share. Entrees were three pastas. All different and all delicious. Brought our own wine for a small corkage fee. Total bill was $140 plus tip for four people. Awesome!!!

Finding a quality and above average Italian restaurant in San Francisco can be trickier than you might think. In a city that offers an abundance of fine dining locations, I come to the source where Italian food dominates and that is none other than the touristy North Beach neighborhood. Having been born and raised not too far from here, I know this is where you will find family owned restaurants and delis. Which takes me to "Trattoria Contadina".Located directly on the corner of Mason St. and Union St., this place has been serving up locals and tourists dating back to 1984. Since this is in a very busy, dense part of the city, it is highly encouraged to arrive here via-Uber/Lyft, Muni bus, or taxi. Since my lady and I are out-of-towners (from Sacramento), we luckily found parking just a block away which was a rarity on a Saturday evening. We came here for our anniversary which was the perfect end to our evening. Keep in mind, reservations are highly encouraged. Our reservations were made through OpenTable which was set for 7:30pm. The entire process was painless from the time we entered to the time we were seated. The interior of Trattoria Contadina is very small but adds to the quaint homely feel. At times, you may feel a little too close to the neighboring tables which for some can be a drawback. However, the high ceilings give it more of an open airy feel to it. And finally, they do have an upstairs area that can be reserved for a larger party. We both decided on ordering a bottle of their "Chardonnay de Tarczal" wine (for about $40). If you do decide on bringing in your own wine, their corkage fee is $25 a bottle. We were given warm a loaf of their sourdough bread complete with balsamic vinaigrette/extra virgin olive oil. Since I am more of a red sauce fan, I decided on their "Polpettine". This consisted of spaghetti pasta complete with Rocky's homemade meatballs and tomato sauce. She went with their "Pavarotti" which was fusilli pasta w/chicken, prosciutto, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, & spicy tomato cream.The restaurant was consistently busy; even at 7:45pm when we ordered our food. By 8:00pm, both our entrees finally arrived. The presentation on both our plates was very well executed. My Polpettine pasta dish was absolutely heavenly as I tasted many amazing spices that balanced out each savory bite. And the homemade meatballs (which they did not skimp on) had wonderful seasonings including garlic, oregano, and Italian spices that made this a truly wonderful dish. I also sampled a few bites of her Pavarotti dish as it was creamy and delicious. Overall, "Trattoria Contadina" is an above average Italian restaurant that I highly recommend if you're a local (like myself) or an out of towner that has never had authentic Italian food before. And the location has more of a hidden feel (a few blocks away from Columbus Ave.) where you won't be in the heart of the touristy areas. Do keep in mind that this place is exclusively a dinner restaurant as they're only open from about 4-9:30pm. All in all, with the service, quality, location, price, and experience, I give this place a perfect five-stars.

Trattoria Contadina is an adorable, bustling little neighborhood gem that serves up some seriously delicious Italian food.Though our waiter told us that the pastas came in fairly generous portions, we couldn't help but order two appetizers to start: the meatballs and the eggplant caponata. The meatballs were delicious--we chose the classic tomato sauce, and our server topped it off with a heap of freshly grated cheese. I'd never tried eggplant caponata before, but I loved it! The ingredients worked together so well, and they were neatly piled atop a crispy piece of garlic crostini. The flavors were wonderful, and the contrasting textures were perfect.For pastas, we went with the ever-popular Vongole and Carlesimo. Both were incredible--very different but each equally delicious in its own right. The Vongole tasted more like many of the pastas I'm familiar with, but it was just executed so well. The combination of lemon, butter, and garlic was just right, and let's be honest, I've never been one to walk away from a seafood pasta. The Carlesimo was unlike anything I'd ever had before, and I loved it. It was creamy, just a little bit spicy, and perfect with the crispy pancetta. In both pastas, the noodles were cooked just the way I like them. I couldn't get enough of either of them, and we spent the entire night swapping our giant pasta bowls across the table.It was definitely too much food for two people, but it was worth the food coma. I wouldn't change a thing, except that maybe next time I would also add dessert. :)I would recommend this spot for so many different occasions--I saw couples, co-workers, friends, families, etc. The ambiance works for anything, and the food is just SO delicious. I can't wait to come back!

Trattoria Contadina is definitely one of my favorite "normal night" restaurants in SF. This place is always packed and deservedly so. The food, service and atmosphere is all warm and definitely classic. Please, make a reservation and prepare to have a lovely evening.This review will be for my most recent visit with A though I have been before to celebrate a friend's birthday and had an equally wonderful experience. A came in for an 8pm reservation on a Friday night and were sat promptly though there were people waiting in the (tiny) restaurant for a seat. Every table was taken; they really pack people in here. We decided not to start with any appetizers since we knew we wanted to order dessert. Since it was a Friday, I wanted to celebrate a little and the waiter was able to recommend a glass of wine that paired perfectly with my entree. We had:-Veal Correnti ($32): This was mine and it was GREAT. I normally don't love cream sauces but I wanted to avoid tomatoes. This cream sauce was super flavorful and the veal was cooked perfectly. The Chianti that as recommended was a great match. A could not stop stealing food from my plate.-Carlesimo ($19): A got this dish and really enjoyed it. He also doesn't normally order cream sauce but liked this since it had a bite to it. I tried some and really enjoyed it as well, enough to maybe order next time.We also HAD to have the Spumoni ($8) that we saw on Yelp and we were not disappointed. Seriously, if you come here and don't order the Spumoni, you are wrong. I was ready to order a piece just for myself after we polished off the first piece but A stopped me...something about self restraint and nutrition.Anyways, why 4 stars instead of a perfect 5? The service is...spotty. We saw our waiter three times: to order, to drop of the wine and to pay. We had to wait a long time for refills on water and didn't get a refill on bread when requested. We also waited a while for a check. I understand they were busy but I think the service aspect could be refined.Trattoria Contadina is a great meal though and definitely worth the stop. We are looking forward to coming back and working our way through their menu. Hopefully the service will be a bit more attentive next time, however.

Next time I'm in the mood for a great "North Beach Italian" restaurant, I'm coming back to Trattoria Contadina. Just near Columbus Ave, we walked up Mason Street to this cozy spot on the corner of Mason and Union. We had a reservation for 8pm on a Tuesday and it was packed, so I'd highly recommend making one before arriving here. The host led us through the restaurant and up to the second level for dinner. We quickly tried their delicious sourdough bread and had to resist gobbling down ten more loaves of it. We started with bruschetta and then ordered the mushroom ravioli, veal scallopini, and osso buco. I didn't get a chance to try the osso buco, but the veal was my favorite. The pasta it came with was buttery and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive, which made our experience even better. We all enjoyed the evening here.

We went to this place due to prior positive reviews.Their menu is limited and so not that many choices for entree.11 bucks for a Caesar salad is out of line.The entrees were tasty but the service was poor.Having to sdk 3 times for refills on water is not cool.Asking 4 times for bread unacceptable.May have been an off night.I would give it another try.

We were craving some authentic italian food, but hoping for a non-touristy spot (ie on columbus). We found this cute little spot on Yelp and made reservations for dinner. I am so glad we did because the location was fairly small so almost all tables were full when we arrived at 7pm. We had a party of 5 and ordered the following:- beer carpaccio- clams and mussels- eggplant- pavarotti- saltimbocca- vongole We ordered a few more dishes but I cant seem to remember their names. I would recommend the pavarotti and the saltimbocca. The pavarotti is rich and creamy. The vongole is pretty heavy but the tender veal tasted great.Overall, a great spot for authentic italian food that is within North beach but you arent surrounded by tourists.

Got a res at Trattoria Contadina for a party of 5 Friday night @5:30pm. I love it when restaurants in the city take reservations! We were seated promptly upstairs by the hostess and were immediately greeted by our waiter. HH was still going on so we opted for some drinks - house wine, old fashions, and a martini. Everyone was pretty happy with their drinks. We started off with a few appetizers - Bruschetta, Meatballs and Marinara, and House Salad. This was the biggest bruschetta I've ever had, large slab of bread with a mound of tomatoes on top. The meatballs were highly recommended on yelp and they were delicious, two meatballs was enough for 5 people to sample. I ordered the Inverno Verde - Conchigle pasta, fennel sausage, arugula, with pesto cream. I was sold on the fennel sausage and the pesto cream. This dish was great, I love the choice of the conchigle pasta, it holds the sauce very well. I also got a taste of the Fruitti Di Mare - Spaghetti, clams, mussels, snapper, calamari, prawns, scallops, and tomato sauce. Also very delicious and a great sample of seafood. Overall we had a wonderful experience, we were able to book a reservation the day of and it was definitely the way to go. The service was great and I loved that the restaurant was hidden off of Columbus Ave... a little more low-key than others in North Beach.

This was a nice little date night spot, but I was disappointed with the food. Although everything looked very nice, the flavors were not all there. Of the three dishes we ordered, my favorite was the appetizer. We had the prosciutto and burrata. My favorite part was how they had fig jam and arugula, drizzled with some olive oil and salt, and the entire dish just came together beautifully. For entrees, we ordered the mushroom ravioli and another pasta dish. The ravioloi was sub-par. The mushroom stuffing was bland, and I found the ravioli shell to be too thick for my liking. The pasta wasn't so great either. It lacked flavor. The only good part about it was that the pasta was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend that you make a reservation. The walk-in line can get very long. Also, finding parking can be tricky here, so give yourself enough time to find parking before your reservation time. This restaurant is worth a shot, but I don't think I will be coming back here again for the price that I paid for mediocre food.

I think this is my favorite Italian restaurant in San Francisco! We got the meatballs, vongole and carlesimo. The meatball was good, but I would be fine without them. However, the pasta was amazing!! You can definitely taste the white wine in the Vongole. If you are looking for something creamy, definitely get the carlesimo. But, if you want something that's going to make you not hate yourself after the meal, get the Vongole. We had the two pastas and meatball for 3 people. I will definitely go back! Restaurant is small though, so you may want to make a reservation! And, service was great! Very attentive and always refilled my water :)

We were celebrating my dad's birthday in the city and I had to find somewhere near Fisherman's Wharf area for dinner. A quick Yelp search led me here and I was able to make reservations at 6pm! We finished a bit early and ended up here around 5:30pm, but that wasn't a problem and were seated upstairs where it was actually a bit cooler because of the nice breeze that came through the windows.Service: The small seating upstairs ensures great service because the waitress can see everything! She had help from a couple other people who refilled water glasses, cleared plates, refilled bread baskets, etc. Great, friendly, and attentive.Food: The pasta here is delicious! The meatballs are pretty darn good also. I ordered some burrata for the table since we made it in time for happy hour prices. It came with heirloom tomatoes, which were delicious! I ordered the Polpettine (spaghetti and meatballs), my parents and my bf ordered the Vongole, and my sister ordered the Salvatore. Everything was great! If I were to do it again, I think I would be quite content with an order of burrata, meatballs, and the bread on the table.Cost: It was definitely on the higher side, especially for being pasta, but the servings were generous and the ingredients were fresh.

Delicious Italian food. More traditional than trendy.The eggplant appetizer was fabulous. I recommend getting a few pastas to share, but you need to order the Carlesimo because it's wonderful - the sauce, the combination of textures, the perfectly al dente pasta. The atmosphere is warm and great for family dinners or a meal with a few friends.

Some of the best Italian food I've ever had! Came here on a busy Thursday evening (yes, it was busy even on a Thursday evening) without any reservations and we had to wait 20 minutes or so, but the wait was worth it. We ordered one entree of pasta between 2 of us, so the total didn't turn out to be too large, but the pricing was definitely on the higher end. The bruschetta was $8 but came with only 2 pieces, which was a bit much. Don't get me wrong though, the food was wonderful and worth the money. The waiters were so kind as well and although the tables were placed close to each other, it felt cozy instead of crowded. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant - and order the tiramisu!

Cute and quaint restaurant atop of a hill near North Beach. The atmosphere screams family.. small kitchen with tight sitting spaces. We had our table ready about 30 min before our reservations, which is always nice if you're running early. We got fresh sourdough bread as we waited for our food. We got the 1. Caprese- so delicious!! Fresh, fresh, fresh mozzarella cheese & basil on top of a purple tomato. The light drizzle of balsamic vinegar was perfect! 2. Frutti de mare- came out piping hot, seafood was fresh. There was a mixture of scallops, shrimp, fish, clams, and mussels. The tomato sauce was light and refreshing. Noodles were perfectly cooked.3. Carlesimo- this dish was OK, the meat was a little too fatty and had pieces of chewy fat that I'd spit out. Didn't taste much of the peas or sun dried tomatoes. 4. Osso bucco- lamb was a bit gamey for my liking. The polenta was bland, but the spinach was seasoned nicely. Overall, this restaurant is a great place for a romantic dinner.. or just a place to drink and eat with friends! Would def come back and try more of their menu!

GOOD FOOD BUT SERVICE DISCRIMINATION: The food was good. I think this is heavily white area. I could sense the difference of service for a brown guy and all white guys. I wanted my drink refill as water. The waiter came three times, addressed the needs of the other 3 tables assigned to him (needless to say white) customers, but didn't even look at my table. Fourth time, I raised both my glasses to make noise. That's when they realized that I need service as well. I want to go there for food again but not sure for service. My experience might have been different if I was white.

This place is really a wonderful, quaint little italian spot. Great AtmosphereFriendly Wait Staff Delicious FlavorsI did have to knock a star for this last visit for two reasons. One of the dishes had a significantly smaller amount of noodles. (About only 10) which left a lot to be desired when there was amazinly flavored bacon sauce flilling the bottom of the bowl with no noodles left to accompany it. The second reason was that one of the four dishes was luke-warm/cold. We all tried each others pastas when they came to the table, and everyone simultaniously noticed that one was quite cold while the others were steaming. We asked for a quick re-heat and we could hear/see the cook slam a pan down and become upset. It just made the experience awkward and we really didnt mean to insult him, just needed the dish a little hotter. I'll still go back!

Wow, what a perfect meal! It was a friend's birthday and her only request was pasta, so we picked this place at random and made a reservation. From the moment we walked in, the staff were so nice and they even set up for a dessert to be delivered to the birthday girl at the end of the night. I ordered the Inverno Verde dish, which was a seashell pasta with a pesto sauce, fennel sausage and arugula. It was delicious! Such a rich sauce, I could've eaten a second plate. My boyfriend got the risotto special which he loved. We had the slice of chocolate with an Oreo base and a tiramisu for dessert.

I wanted cozy. I wanted Italian food. I wanted convenience to our evening show of "Beach Blanket Babylon." I got all three in Trattoria Contadina. The excellent no-nonsense service and warm atmosphere was a bonus.After discovering Trattoria Contadina on Yelp, I called twice to get a reservation -- but short notice means no luck. So, we made plans to go somewhere else before our show. The other place didn't take reservations, so when we walked past Trattoria Contadina, I poked my head in just in case. The hostess greeted us warmly and said she'd had a couple no-shows, "So let's do it!" We were seated immediately and quickly had bread and attentive service. I was happy -- even happier moments later with wine poured.We split the trio of meatballs -- solid 2.5" orbs of meat with choice of sauce (we had the classic tomato). I had a cup of minestrone that was good but not special. My gnocchi were excellent and a large portion. I judge an Italian restaurant by its gnocchi, and these were denser than I prefer but still very tasty in a creamy tomato sauce. A crew of attentive staff ensured we always had water, bread, hand-grated parmesan, fresh pepper and a clean table. We skipped dessert because of the show time, but I am confident that the menu of Italian standards would have delivered just as well as the other courses.The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with friendly people waiting on you -- and things moved quickly. Two families with small children enjoyed meals nearby, as did other groups, and it was clear this is a place with a loyal base of local customers as well as tourists who stumble on it via guidebooks or Google. I'm definitely keeping this one on my list of places to return for a quality Italian meal.

Fabulous traditional Italian eatery. Great ambience and great food, the pasta dishes are exceptional. Super wine list. Only reason it's not a five is that service was rather relaxed.

4.5 stars for this gem of a generational Italian restaurant with a very reasonable price point. The service is great here and the small San Francisco neighborhood feel emanates from this charming eatery and albeit small bar. The dishes are consistent and most of them meet expectations. The burrata caprese is exceptionally good. Again, this neighborhood and friendly eatery is charming and the service is solid.It is also located on a cable car line if you feel especially lazy and don't wish to walk. Like with most places in San Francisco, don't even try to drive and park anywhere near here save a few nearby garages..

Note: The Yelp dinner menu is slightly different than the current dinner menu at the restaurant. Some items that are recommended here by everyone on Yelp aren't on the menu, but can be ordered there.Anyway, this is the cutest little Italian neighborhood gem! I love that it's slightly tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Columbus Ave, but also only a block away from it if you want to go for a post-dinner stroll. This restaurant is perfect for a romantic date night! We went for dinner early at 5:45pm on a Friday night and were able to be seated immediately, luckily! ...because it seemed they were actually fully booked with reservations for the rest of the night. We had the meatballs (must, must, must!) and mista salad to start. Both perfect! Then, my boyfriend got the Vincenzo (I snuck a few bites -the sausage is amazing and the sauce has a spicy kick!) and I got the Correnti (super creamy and delicious). For dessert, we shared the Mocha Fango with an espresso each. Absolutely incredible! We kept the wine flowing throughout dinner too, and it was one of the best overall meals we've had :)

Service was great, the place is pretty small, so tables are squeezed together, but it's okay we can all get real personal and intimate. I had their meatballs and their signature and famous carlesimo.

Amazing little trattoria tucked away in North Beach. Came here on Saturday evening reservation and we were seated a couple of minutes early. After deliberation we ordered the Rigantoncelli alla Carlesimo and Vongole (spaghetti with white wine sauce and seafood). The Vongole is a more traditional dish, but it was probably the best white wine sauce and seafood spaghetti dish I've ever had. Other restaurants tend to make it too watery due to the clams, but Trattoria Contadina cooked it perfectly. The Rigatoncelli was very heavy (perfectly al dente and chewy) as the pasta itself was large and the sauce was tomato cream, but still DELICIOUS. I savored every bite of both pastas and would order them again in a heartbeat. For drinks, I got the Bee's Knees cocktail and the bf got a Barbera red. Both were delicious! For dessert, we got the Mocha Fango, which is a mocha gelato cake with an oreo type chocolate crust. Very cutely plated, large portioned (good to share) and sooo good.Already planning the next time I come back :)

My husband and I got engaged here 25 years ago, and we come back every time we get a chance. The food was fantastic as always. The restaurant is now being run by the third generation of the original owners, and they are a wonderful bunch. Our waitress was excellent, the service terrific, and we'll be back again!!

Wonderful service, even as an alone diner (yay Chris!) ! Totally willing to accommodate small changes to dishes without frowning. Two things I hate - luke warm food and soggy zucchini. The dish came out so hot I had to wait to eat I (again, yay!!) AND somehow the zucchini still wasn't smooshy. Well worth the departure from Columbus up the hill.

Your typical Italian restaurant, the food was good but didn't stand out to me. The atmosphere is very cozy in this little spot, there's also upstairs seatingThey give you complementary bread and olive oil to start off with while you wait for your food. It would've been better if the bread wasn't cold.- Fruitti di Marespaghetti with clams, mussels, snapper, calamari, prawns, scallops in a tomato sauce- Osso Bucored wine and tomato braised lamb shank, served with saffron risotto and peas.Portions are shareable and recommended!

You must order the pepper roasted bell pepper stuffed with three cheeses in a spicy tomato cream sauce. This was recommended by some locals that were sitting next to us. It may be the best thing I have ever put in my mouth!!

This is by far the best pasta I have ever had! I loved this place so much that I wouldn't mind to drive from Long Beach just to go eat here. The atmosphere is nice too, I like how quiet it is and everyone is so friendly there but there food is amazing! I believe I ordered the first pasta in the pasta section and my boyfriend ordered ravioli which was good too! I just loved this place so much and if I could I would give it more than 5 stars.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Every time I go back it gets better. They serve amazing authentic Italian cuisine, while maintaining a homey feeling in the restaurant. It's best to make a reservation unless you're okay with eating at 4pm or 8pm. Free bread and olive oil and vinegar to start. I love to start with the burratta and prosciutto plate ($17), as it is the freshest burratta I've ever had. I had the il diavolo as my entree. It's new to the menu and amazing. Perfect amount of spice.

So happy I found this place on Yelp!! Have been trying to avoid tourist restaurants etc since we got here. Booked via open table at about 10am on Saturday and there was a only a table at 4:30pm available - happy hour is 4-6 so ended up working out well, shared some appetizers on happy hour and drank many happy hour cocktails and didn't order our mains until about 6, the staff didn't rush us at all. I had the gnocchi which was delicious. This place is definitely worth going to. Make sure you book - I also noticed they turned away a family with young children so worth calling ahead if you're going with your family to check whether children are allowed here.

Nice food and nice place. Service was great too. We ordered our food and we were impressed how thoughtfully the food was served. First our appetizer right on time and then the food and more drink. we did not to have ask for any thing as the waiter could read our mind. They have the best pasta.

I feel as though I have been blessed with the ability to use language in a fashion that allows me to communicate ideas in a way that people may easily understand. I'm not claiming to be Hemingway or Joyce. I'm just saying. So, it frustrating that I don't seem to be able to organize the appropriate words to describe the Salvatore Chicken Ravioli that I just ravished at Trattoria Contadina. So, here is my straight forward assessment of the meal I just had: this might be the best Ravioli dish I have ever had. Imagine a flavor and texture that tastes the way that fine silk might feel when pulled across your exposed skin. That's as close as I can come to describing it. I did not try anything else on the menu because it would have felt like cheating. I met Vince, the founder's grandson, and he was great. Professional, friendly and diligent. He clearly has great pride in the restaurant and is a wonderful ambassador. The atmosphere was "neighborly" and appropriately vibrant for this neighborhood spot. I loved it and I'll be back.

Rustic and Authentic Italian food served by very competent staff, Trattoria Contadina is probably the best Italian food we have had the pleasure of eating in the Bay Area. Gina is a very charming host and she and Kevin have made a real jewel in the heart of North Beach. Every bite of every dish we ate was just perfect. Whether you are a first-timer or a regular Italian foodie ... this is one place which you must go. I particularly enjoyed eating the Pesce Picatta ... and I highly recommend this for seafood lovers. Planning to go back soon in my second of many more visits. Hope this place flourishes for generations to come

The antipasto was drenched in sauce as was the veal scallopini. Too heavy. Also, the veal was tough. The veal chop had too much vinegar in the sauce and was sour. Not recommended.

This restaurant is small but cute. They have upstairs seating as well which isn't evident when you are downstairs. I think the food is fairly average. We had the meatballs and it was fairly average...Italian homemade makes a significantly better meatball. My bf had the mushroom ravioli and it was pretty earthy and the ravioli was well cooked...a little al dente with good bite. I had the lamb shank. It was highly underwhelming. It came with polenta and spinach that was literally swimming in butter. The lamb was not well seasoned and not cooked long enough because it was a little tougher than other lamb shanks I've had at other restaurants. It was also a bit gamey which is also an indication of lack of seasoning. I would not come back to this place because there are significantly better restaurants in north beach.

My boyfriend took me here on our first date and it was amazing! I got the cheese stuffed ravioli and he got the spaghetti w/ meatballs. So delicious! Our server was really sweet and attentive. The decor is so cute and I love how it's a bit away from the Washington Square area. We'll definitely be coming back!

Years back I asked a close friend - he's 100% Italian :) - where to go for some good Italian food on a first date. Without hesitation he recommended Trattoria Contadina. Trattoria is the perfect representation of a high-quality, family owned/operated restaurant. We've come for random date nights, a birthday (8-10 people), when we have family in town, and every anniversary since. The service and food is always perfect. Thank you Correnti family for such great dining experiences with our friends and family!

My friend and I were craving Italian food really badly. Bella Trattoria was closed, so we ended up driving all the way to North Beach to try out this spot.We came here on a pretty slow weekday night, so we got seated immediately. I liked that this place was small yet cozy. We really liked how everything was set up in the restaurant.We had the Eggplant with tomato sauce for the appetizer. The eggplant was cooked well and the sauce complimented it. I just thought this dish was okay.For entrees, my friend ordered the Carlesimo and I had the Pavarotti. The rigatoncelli in the Carlesimo resembled macaroni but super sized. The sauce was pretty good but it wasn't that special for me. The Pavarotti was a huge disappointment. Instead of a cream sauce, the sauce was super thin and there wasn't much of it. The dish tasted super bland, like they didn't use any salt or flavoring in it.Overall, I just think this place has bland food. It doesn't have enough flavor for me. I probably wouldn't come back.

Run if a Moscow mule comes in a glass, Trattoria Contadina serves theirs in a copper mug so we were off to a good start! I had their house speciality, the Carlesimo, which was cooked perfectly al dente and hot when it came out. The pasta itself looked like big macaroni with a spicy tomato crime sauce, mushrooms, pancetta, and peas. I was worried about how spicy the sauce is because I'm a wimp, but I wouldn't say it's spicy at all. So if you're really looking for a kick, I would ask the waiter to bump up the hear for ya. But it was utterly delicious, I would order this again for sure. Really cozy vibes, a little bit of a blast to the past with the wood paneling, but well decorated and clean! Great service as well.

Love love love this place! Sat at the bar and had a lonely conversation with the bartender who is the grandson of the owner. This place has been around for 33 years-same two head chefs and you can tell a lot of love goes into their food and their atmosphere. A true San Francisco authentic Italian restaurant. Love.

A very small and unique place with a full bar. A huge range of whiskey selections (not much of Japanese whiskeys though). They need to work on their cocktail menu since there's only about 10 on the list. They have quick service but servers were not too friendly or social. We ordered the clams and mussels as appetizers and it was nicely done. Very tasty; there's a garlic taste but not too strong that it takes away the taste from the seafood. We also had the chicken ravioli in a cream sauce. It's a super simple dish, but their special cream sauce made a huge difference. The chicken inside the tiny raviolis are so soft and tender and it goes well with the sauce. Last but not least, we ordered the "carlesimo" which is just simply pasta, peas, and sun dried tomatoes, but they did a good job. It's in a semi spicy tomato sauce. It's not spicy to me so I wish they could've made it more spicy. I'll come back next time and try other items on their menu.

Cool little restaurant that has been here forever. Excellent service.Perfectly executed traditional standards, but a little boring for me.But IMO they do have some outstanding dishes.The Good:Eggplant with olives, mozzarella, basil and a tomato sauce - absolutely deliciousThe Average:Caprese salad - just ok for me - I prefer more balsamic reduction and riper tomatoesMeatballs - perfectly cooked traditional meatballs, excellent but a little boring for my tasteRisotto with chicken, capers and pesto - good but agai a little on the boring side for me, this one is better suited for a for a more conservative palate

Italian fare that's executed well and is just the right portion given the quality and price - for example, my namesake, the Vincenzo, which is a fettucine dish topped with sausage, peppers, onions, olives, and tomato sauce. A simple, satisfying, honest-to-goodness dish. The venue itself is a cozy, intimate neighborhood joint that reminds me a lot of my favorite trattorias from my time living in NYC. Good food, good wine, and good times all around.

Absolutely love this place! We have to go here every time we make it to San Francisco. The food and service are amazing. Everything from the greeting at the door to the dessert drinks is always a pleasure. The owners are usually there with a warm smile and ready with a wonderful recommendation based on our moods. This place is a delight that many of recommend. Top notch all the way!

We had a large group (11 total), a reservation and a craving for Italian. This place did not let us down! Between us all we had a variety of dishes including the (appetizers) meatballs, carpaccio, caprese, (dinner) snapper, oso buco, carlesimo, saltimboca, il davio and a bunch of other plates I can't spell. We also had an order of tiramisu which is what dream are made of. Bottom line is I would come back in a second! Generous portions, great atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing eats.

We were looking for a place to eat on New Year's Day. We had spent most of the day at Fisherman's Wharf to Pier 39. On the way back to our car which was parked at Ghiradelli Square, we were thinking of where to eat at 7pm. We looked at yelp and were craving some really good Italian Food. My brother found Trattoria Condtadina. The reviews were exceptional, the foodie pictures looked phenomenal and so he called in. The guy who made reservations for us was a lifesaver. He managed to squeeze the 3 of us in for dinner. It was the best decision on both parties, because now I know where to go when I visit San Francisco. This place is not located in Little Italy, and it's located in the neighborhood where you would at least expect it. There's no competition for this restaurant and I feel most of the customers are local near by neighbors. Once you get in, there is limited space to wait inside. But it's definitely worth the time waiting, when you get inside the restaurant eat some really good Italian Food. I had orderded the seafood penne. It was supposed to be spaghetti, but I asked for a penne substitute. My mom and brother had the same but stook with the spaghetti. It was a delicious dinner. I wish I could've added more penne. We also started off with an appetizer of Mussels, and clams. It was definitely a great way to start off the dinner. I also had lemonade as a drink, My mom and brother had wine. The environment here is very romantic and Italian-Family feel to it. We ended the night with tiramisu and cappucino. The tiramisu was to die-for. The cappucino was really good too. This is definitely a restaurant to come to. I can't wait to come back to S.F. and get some more of that tiramisu. Thanks Trattoria!!!

I'm afraid to say but this was mediocre for me. After scouring different reviews and menus in the area I made a reservation while in SF on a business trip. I don't consider myself, by any stretch, to be an Italian food expert, but I could tell the food would be "eh" at best when it plopped at my seat literally five minutes after ordering. In some instances you want food delivered quickly but when you go out for a nice dinner it's okay to wait for a few. It was clear in this case they had vats of dishes in the kitchen and just scooped out my plate. It tasted okay, but it also tasted like it had been sitting for a while - lukewarm and a little flavorless. Service was great and the food tasted like it could be good had I eaten it after it had been cooked instead of a lengthy time later, but I just wish it wasn't so blatantly prepared in mass quantities.
