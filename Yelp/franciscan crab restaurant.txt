Fish sandwich: okay, but so many better places around. $10 for a fish sandwich, basa on dry and stale roll, light slaw on top, bland. Coating on fish was attractive and it was cooked right, but 1/20th the taste palette of Codmother's which is just a block or two away (with AWESOME fries too!). Packaged tarter sauce and malt vinegar helped it go down, threw out most of the roll. No hot sauce at this place?!? Yeesh.What really blew my mind, on a day with air quality of 172 at this location due to the Napa fires, they actually fleece customers and additional DOLLAR for a cup for water. Thankfully I still had a small one from work that they filled "free." Minor miracles. I know it's the wharf and you kinda bend over when you come up here, but still can't support a local business that pulls stunts like this. Meh sandwich, I get it, it's food and didn't get sick. But charging your customers an outrageous fee for a cup for water to wash it down just ruins whatever they had going for them. A couple stars for the view and the fact I found a workaround to the water fleecing.

Came to SF for the Labor Day weekend. By far, the best place I went to the entire time. Unique restaurant with white tile & red seats everywhere. Cramped but still an enjoyable experience because the food makes you forget that immediately. They have a nice looking bar but like I said it's very cramped inside so elbow room is nonexistent. I ordered the Dungeness Crab, Mussels & Shrimp, all in garlic sauce. Everything was served on a sizzling skillet, drenched in all kinds of garlicky goodness.Oh man! Best crab I have ever eaten. The sweetness of it just blew me away. The calamari was just ok. They use cornmeal & I think Old Bay seasoning for it which aren't my favorite things. But to was cooked really well & not chewy or gummy at all. The draft beer is very good. I prefer mine colder but the Stella I ordered was right on. Great atmosphere, situated right on the Pier (41 or 43, I think) right across from the Boudin Sourdough Bakery. This is a great place for a family dinner. Not so much for romance because the indoor seating is LOUD. The patio seating is small & the chairs aren't the nice ones inside, but u'll enjoy the better view. Inside seating by the windows in hopes of getting a romantic sunset dinner will always be threatened with the legendary fog of San Francisco... So sit outside, enjoy the breeze & people watch as you chow down.

Beautiful views and friendly staff with average seafood options. Let's start by stating the obvious. For good or for bad, this is a tourist trap. The views are amazing and the service is good. The food quality however is not reflected in the price.If you are going with the name SF Crab Restaurant, you better serve some mean crab. I'm sorry but the Crab doesn't even rank in my top 10, let alone my top 5. The rest of the seafood is actually quite better compared to the Crab but still falls short, given the price point. This is a great place to go with a large group that's never been to San Francisco for the experience and the views, assuming you do not mind overspending on mediocre food.

Awesome. Great views. Great ambiance. Awesome food. Good service. Had coppa appetizer. Clam chowder. I had the abalone. It was tremendous. Even the vegetables and pasta with it were tasty. And plenty of it. My wife had the filet mignon. She gave me some. It melted in my mouth. Very pricey, but that's expected. Bring your wallet, but definitely go. A real special place.

This is a restaurant with a great view of Alcatraz and the bay. Great place to try if you're a tourist visiting San Francisco. Food was average for me. Although I really loved their crab fondue. We had the shrimp and crab platter, oysters, calamari, hamachi. All we're good but I had better at other seafood restaurants in San Fran.

My family had reservations for our party of 6 at 5:30 for my uncles birthday. We arrived and got seated right away. Our server came and got us water, took our order, brought our food out and we never saw him again. The busser came and cleared our table before we even got the bill. That's how slow our waiter was. We ordered a salad plate, the fish plate choice of 1 fish and a way it is cooked, alfredo for my siblings, buttermilk battered chicken, and dungeons crab.The food was pretty good but very expensive. 2 stars for service 4 stars for food Al

Located by the water with a lovely view, this upstairs and 1920s vibe of a restaurant is a crab lovers and seafood paradise. Beautifully crafted menus illustrate their items and the decor is classy. The food was pretty good but it didn't make my top list of seafood restaurants. [The restaurant & service] Arriving at the restaurant, watch your step as you ascend the stairs into a beautifully decorated space with large windows (lots of natural lighting), white table cloths, and a fresh crab display. Since my group was a party of 10 people including a toddler, we were put more towards the restroom area where it was more spacious and out of the way. Menus were handed and drink orders were taken. Service was on top of things, they even brought out complimentary bread and amazing butter. They had the freshest and most creamy butter that I have ever tasted! [The food] The food was tasty but nothing special that exploded my tastebuds or anything. -appetizer // complimentary bread with butter // I LOVED that butter, but man did that bread make my jaw hurt. It was tasty but as a person who wears retainers at night to keep their teeth straight, this one definitely made my teeth crooked for the night haha....-starter soup // crab chowder in a sourdough bread bowl // 15.95 // Decided to YOLO and go with the bread bowl since there was only a 3.00 difference between the cup and bread bowl. The crab chowder has a different base than the clam chowder, so do not be fooled. It's still good but from everyone's reaction, the clam chowder was the real winner. -entree // wild halibut in ciopinno sauce // 32.95 // Overall a tasty dish, with tiny quinoa looking pasta, veggies, a generous chunk of halibut and the cioppino sauce. My only downfall was that the cioppino sauce was not as good as other places that I've been to around the wharf area. It was missing something and tasted more of marinara or canned stewed tomatoes. Overall, this restaurant has a nice ambiance and is appealing to the eye, however there was just a few flavor components missing in the food for me to truly feel like it was worth the amount of money spent. ALSO, please don't forget to get your car tickets validated if you parked in the lots around fishermen's wharf. We were only there for about 2 hours and we were charged 36 dollars because we forgot to get our ticket validated....it was as if Karl the fog decided he wanted to join us for dinner as well.

Food was decent. Definitely better options for the price. I think people go here for the view which is amazing. I saw quite a few people with binoculars with tables facing the windows so maybe it's a good bird watching or boat watching spot?Has a great view of Alcatraz Calamari is good here. If you park here they validate so the first three hours are only 3 dollars I think. Bathrooms are clean Probably won't go back as there are better choices nearby for the price.

This restaurant lives up to it's reputation of being an expensive restaurant. However, it is a Fisherman's Wharf landmark. It was around decades before Pier 39 was built and has a good view of Alcatraz Island. They have a good selection of pastas, seafood, and steaks. We had the crab, pasta, and some salads. All were good. The sourdough bread they serve is from Acme Bakery from the East Bay. I prefer it to Boudin's, which is the longtime bakery at Fisherman's Wharf.This restaurant does not have parking, but there are lots close. Traffic is congested around the Wharf and Pier 39, so I recommend the bus, cable car, or walking.

Pros:- great view of the ships and water at sunset- good service- crab chowder in a bread bowl was tastyCons:- long wait (an hour)- too expensive, not worth it in my opinion (over $200 for a party of 4)- bacon bits in my spicy shrimp pasta overpowered the seafood taste (which I want to be able to taste if I'm eating at a seafood restaurant)Would I come back again? No. If I could do it again, I would just get their Dungeness crab instead of pasta and other dishes. It would probably be more worth it.

I went for simple fish and chips on early Saturday afternoon. Opted to sit out in the sun after 2 days of rain. Fish nicely done, slightly crunchy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside. Portion is huge for one person, just nice size to share though. It's the location that's ideal. Great entertainment from street music to scenery. Best part? Parking validation just across the street. Spend $10 on fish and chips, save $45 in parking. Sweet, no?

Excellent place for all occasions! We were sat immediately by a window with a great view of Alcatraz. The staff was extremely attentive and very friendly. The bread starter is delicious and just kept coming! I had the best fish and chips I've ever had in my life- wow. I also tried he vegetable Bolognese which I thought could be a much bigger portion for $20 but still tasty and he crab sliders were very flavorful. If you're looking for great seafood, this is the place to go!

I've probably passed by this restaurant a million times just walking around Fisherman's Wharf, but with all the other food places in the area I never made it in. I finally got to try it Thursday night and it made me wish I had checked it out sooner. The building itself is amazing. It's this massive ship inspired structure with these huge windows, so guests are treated to a panoramic view of San Francisco Bay. That being said, this place gets pretty busy - lots of tourists. Thankfully we had a reservation, and were seated right away in a nice little booth facing the water. Everything on the menu looked good, so it took us awhile to figure out what to get. We ended up with the crab & smoked salmon bellini, the sea bass in a lemon butter garlic caper sauce, and the seafood fettuccine. The sea bass was a tiny bit over cooked, but it was nothing to complain about as it was still absolutely scrumptious. The pasta was made perfectly, and the bellini appetizer was light yet satisfying. We were planning on getting dessert, but we were so full, we had to pass. We'll definitely be back though.Tip: Incorporate the Embarcadero traffic into your travel time. Good news: They validate parking for the first 2 hours and there's a lot right in front of the restaurant.

We were visiting San Francisco and we were being tourists on Pier 39, walking around looking for a place to eat. There are so many choices, but we decided to go into the Franciscan Crab Restaurant. The view from the Franciscan is amazing! The have long windows all around and you could see into the bay and Alcatraz (they even have binoculars so you can take a closer look). This place is in the expensive side but the food was amazing!There were 4 of us, but another group of 5 joined us. We did not have any reservations, we just kind of showed up. The staff was great and accommodated in a big table big enough for our group. They took our orders and the food came out really fast. The server was really attentive and when we asked at the beginning if we could get separate checks, the server said "yes". Most of the group ordered the Clam Chowder and/or Crab Chowder. However, I ordered the Basa (fish) with a spicy gochujang glaze (side note: the glaze on the fish was to die for) and it also comes with acini di pepe pasta with sun dried tomatoes and snap peas, some potatoes and slices of corn on the cob.The Basa was cooked to perfection and the combination with that spicy gochujang glaze was a pair made in heaven. The acini di pepe pasta was also delicious, at first glance I thought it was Israeli Couscous because it looks similar. Overall, it was tasty and had a great time. P.S. I'm still dreaming of that BASA!

I know, I know, it's on the Wharf - the tourist trap of San Francisco. My husband has never been to San Francisco, so I had to allow him to experience the chaos down there. So, on our way to see the sea lions, we decided to stop for lunch at the Fanciscan. We got there around 1pm on a Monday afternoon. We were promptly whisked away to a table overlooking the bay. We had an amazing uninterrupted view!! We decided to grab a glass of wine and share a few appetizers. We ordered the crab fondue, shrimp cocktail and a bowl of clam chowder. Man oh man - we really enjoyed all of them. The crab fondue was so creamy with a ton of flavor and came out hot hot hot! The shrimp were pretty big but we could have used a little bit more of the delicious cocktail sauce. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his chowder. The service was good. We were only one table of three at the time, so it would have been hard not to provide great service. With so many amazing restaurants in San Francisco, I was a little leery of this place just based on its location, but it didn't disappoint!

We walked in solely to try out some oysters. They were hit or miss. Did not get that nice buttery, creamy texture that I expect from Pacific oysters. You place your order at the counter and seat yourself, when your order is ready, your number is called out. It took a bit to get our oysters even though there were not that many people there. Does have a nice view of the bay though.

I have to give this place 5 stars because the dungeon crabs were amazing and their house salad was delicious. Came here for dinner after we biked to the Golden Gate Bridge. My boyfriend ordered the crab sliders and I ordered the seafood fettuccine for our entrees. We shared a house salad together and half an order of crab. Love love the house salad and crab. Salad was perfectly made with dressing and bite size lettuce. Crab was soft and melts in your mouth. They bring you the tools you need for your crab at the table. My boyfriend and I were pretty full by the time we got our entrees but we did our best to eat most of it. Their entrees size was big so we know to share stuff here next time. I loved how they give you pictures on the menu. It helps a lot when you order. The view was spectacular where we were seated. I definitely loved this place and will come back or recommend it.

Decided to give the San Franciscan another chance. The food was awesome, especially the yellowtail carpaccio and the crab fondue. We went around 2 p.m., which was a less crowded time and had an excellent view of the water. The food came out looking very appetizing and our waiter was very kind with a smile on his face. It made me enjoy my visit again to the Pier. Thank you Franciscan for an amazing late lunch.

Had the fishwich and I must say it was tasty and definitely something you should try. Fish was fresh, flaky, and flavorful. I would add a more zesty coleslaw to add more flavor to sandwich overall. Great portion size to share and plenty to enjoy. Location and ambiance are great. Right on the water and you can see Alcatraz out the window while dining. I would definitely try this spot and enjoy it.

Although we had to wait a while, the crab Alfredo was delicious. I highly recommend the dish. Alfredo will never tase the same. My BF ordered the crab and he stated it was delicious, but felt like it was not enough. The view of the bay was gorgeous and the service so-so. The waiter failed to check on us often and I was done with my meal before I ever got a water refill.

After having clam chowder in Fisherman's Wharf, we decided to take a stroll along the bay and originally, we passed by Franciscan without any thought. After taking a second glance, we realized that they serve "fresh" beignets here after seeing it advertised on the awning so we decided to stop by and check it out.The beignets came out super hot; they just deep fried them as soon as we ordered and coated it with powdered sugar. While the beignets were warm and fluffy, I wouldn't say the dough was the best I've ever had. To be perfectly fair, some of the best beignets I've had were at Disneyland and those were amazing. The beignets here were average and nothing special; I wouldn't go out of my way to get them here.

Great choice by the coworker for bringing all of us here for our dinner! The place has high windows and neon lights in the front. It has a great view of the bay and street lights of the Embarcadero. We ordered the octopus carpaccio, calamari, some raw oysters, and crab fondue. Although I didn't try the fondue, it looked creamy and delicious. It was my first time having octopus carpaccio and it was pleasant. I wasn't a fan of the texture though. The oysters were perfect! The calamari was slightly spicy which made it different from other places. I ordered the crab louie salad which was larger than I thought from the picture. The crab was generous and the olives, tomatoes, boiled eggs, and avocado were all great additions. For dessert I tried the frozen custard which was crazy addicting. It had a smooth texture and wasn't too sweet. Needless to say that everyone finished their meal. This place is a go-to if you're looking for some bomb seafood, especially for some crab. I cannot wait to come back again!

This location is a 5 Star View with a 1 Star Service and 1 Star Food.The Waiter was slow and antisocial. Our order was wrong "they brought mussels when we ordered garlic steamed clams" then argued with us about it being wrong. The clams arrived 15 minutes later and we had already finished the other food. The clams were tasteless and had sandy grit in it, a sign that they were not properly cleaned. The Crab Chowder was also tasteless and had almost no crab on it. I should have stayed with just a bowl of clam chowder.I expected the overpriced food due to the location, but at these prices you deserve quality service and quality food, both of which are lacking at this beautiful location.Note - This is the second time here and the second time with the same results so I am comfortable saying to go to another local restaurant and do not waste your time or money here.

This is one of those places that I just have to go to when I'm in SF. Overall the place is clean and the employees are very nice and their service is good and fast. I think the prices are pretty fair for being a seafood restaurant near the ocean. Their filet mignon is very good, tender and juicy. The mash that comes with it is so goooood. I've tried their calamari, yellow carpaccio, their iron roasted skillet seafood, sea bass, and seafood fettuccine. All very satisfying. But my all time favorite is the spicy shrimp pasta, hmmm the flavor. I ordered that about 3-5 times already, can't get enough of it. Btw not sure why it's called spicy, there is no spice to it lol, but still very yummy!!

If you feel like you have extra money to spend, The Franciscan is a great place to do it. Once you get over the sticker shock you can settle into the ambiance. The restaurant has a beautiful view of the bay. When you're waiting for a table they have an outdoor balcony you can hang out on that overlooks the wharf.Overall, food was delicious. How can you not love a place that gives you bibs so you can attack your shellfish dishes? We made sure to keep the bread flowing at our table. It was the perfect compliment to the buttery sauces our seafood was swimming in. I would love to go back for another "treat yourself day".

Beautiful location, friendly server, but it's a tourist trap!!!!!First, the host gave us a hard time when trying to sit with our family who arrived earlier than us. I can understand that though since the timing was off. I just wish they were more polite and accommodating about it. More importantly, the crab prices are astronomical for such little food! A half crab... literally a half of one crab is $30! I think I had like 4 bites of food. I left starving and just grabbed some seafood down by the pier. Bread bowls of clam chowder are delicious and the bread is fresh just like everywhere in SF. BLT salad was incredibly underwhelming. Our actual server was very kind and she did a great job. Overall, not worth the $$$!

When I walked in the first impression was, wow awesome view, woah Alcatraz, crab display nice. Then as I actually looked, it was hot inside, busy so the floors were dirty, and the prices are a bit scary. The experience over all is exciting as a tourist because you get binoculars with your table to spy on sailors and watch guard for make believe prisoners escaping Alcatraz. The food is presented awesomely, and the staff is super nice, it's pretty good, and I personally (being very hungry from the trip over and looking for good food) couldn't find any touristy places that are better.

I went here Saturday afternoon on a weekend trip and surprisingly it was pretty empty. We sat on the second floor next to windows with a binocular on the window pane so you can look out and see Alcatraz island from afar and the San Francisco waters. I loved this view; it made the dining experience very memorable for me. I ordered clam chowder in a sour dough bowl, seafood pasta in squid ink, whole Dungeness crab, black mussels in a white wine sauce, and seafood cioppino. I thought everything tasted good and had good flavors to them. But, I do feel the price for some plates were pretty expensive such as the whole crab. It was a pretty small crab and didn't have much meat on it but it was costly. Service was good. Our waiter was nice. He was pretty quiet and seemed shy but he was attentive and checked up on us often. Maybe because the restaurant was also empty, service was better than other reviews I've read. I'm not sure. But I would come back here next time I take a trip to the Bay Area.

Nice view but the beignets were disappointing. They were bland and needed some flavor - cinnamon, extra powdered sugar, something. Also they came with a container of butter in the middle.. strange. Maybe I'm spoiled after eating beignets in New Orleans, but these aren't worth it. We didn't try any of the other food (which looked pretty good) so I can only rate on the beignets.

All of the food was delicious, tasted fresh, and had a great visual presentation! The restaurant has ample seating inside and outside and two clean unisex bathrooms.

TL:DR The food isnt worth the prices and the wait staff are subpar. We were sat quickly but then quickly forgotten. The waiter stopped with water and asked if we were ready and we said we needed more time. More time did not mean leave our table alone for over 20 minutes. The food is expensive for serving sizes and the quality doesn't warrant the price. The waiters also ignored us the entire time we had our food which meant many of us went with a drink. They also cleared the table and cleaned it while we were still sitting here right while we were waiting on the check.

The view is beautiful. The crab is ok. The oysters are very fresh and tasty. The calamari is one of the best I've had and not over breaded. Parking can be pricy the lot across the street is the one they validate for. It charges 15 minute intervals.

I came here for dinner and had a great time. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the ambiance of the restaurant was very casual but classy at the same time. The inside of the restaurant reminds me of a very fancy dinner with stellar views of the water. The food was great and a good portion size as well. I would definitely come back here for lunch or dinner!

This place was one of the best places that I have ever been to. The view is wonderful, the service is absolutely fantastic, and the food is killer. The crabs are great, and there is always someone to take away whatever you are finished with. The workers are really friendly, and it's such a clean restaurant. We will definitely be back here in the future, and I recommend most definitely if you are looking for an amazing restaurant with a gorgeous view and the most amazing service, go to this place!! It's wonderful! The busser boy was my favorite, always there to help, and I honestly think he should get a raise, because he is so amazing.

For some reason this was a four-start rating, $$ price level on yelp when I went there a few days ago, but now it shows $$$ and 3.5 starts. Went there while visiting fisherman's wharf, knowing the view would be fantastic, just to find the view might be the only pleasant.The staff working there seem not happy. We got in and stood by the host desk waiting to be seated. It was 4pm and the restaurant was still quiet. The host was talking to another employee for half a minute before he turned his face to us, and he looked unhappy with eyebrows twisted. I said we're a party of 3 and he confirmed "3?". This is the only word he ever sais to us. He then took us to the seat in silence, put the menu down and left.They we had to keep sitting there for 10 minutes before our server came to ask what we'd wanna drink, btw he didn't look happy neither from what I could see on his face. Again the restaurant was not busy at all and there were a few people passing our table but none stopped or informed our server until 10 mins past.Then we ordered a big combo, octupos cappaccio, crab chowder in bread bowl and a seabass. The food didn't take long to come, but interestingly the server came to ask "is everything okay?" When the food runner was placing dishes on table. How would I know if it's okay when my dish was still in your runner's hand???As for the food, there seabass read decent, octupos cappaccio was okay, and overall all the dishes were kinda salty, especially the crab chowder and grilled shrimps. The saltiness covered all other flavours. Our server never came back to the table. Another lady server passed by a few times I asked her fee for the check when we're done. She approached the table, heard what I said and nodded, when brought the check, took my card to swipe and brought there check folder back. She had a smile on her face but DIDN'T say a word during this entire time! None! It was silent again.It was just wired, like I said the staff didn't look happy at all.I still tipped 15% but honestly, I won't be ashamed even I didin't give a dime, for this kind of "service".Btw, yes I know you might be really dissapointed to hear this, this is not the usuau case of your level of service, you take issues and concerns seriously, and you strive to provide excellent experience to every guest.

Came back to this restaurant over the Christmas break holiday. We live in L.A, but we always come down to Pier 39 and end up eating around here several times a year.This restaurant, even though is on the expensive side, in comparison to what's available at the Pier... always has good food. However, the service is BAD.This time, to be fair, our server "Leonard" was attentive, when he was around. The problem is, he was not around that much, and the food constantly got dumped on our table by the staff in the kitchen, without the existing food and plates being cleaned off first. So while we are still eating our appetizers, the new food comes in and they drop it off and there is no room. We are trying to give them empty plates while they are walking away. It was very frustrating. Last time I came, the service was so bad that we wanted to walk out. We came back again because we really like the food. If it wasn't for the good food, we would never give this place a second chance. Management, please do something about your operation. Your food is great but service is horrible. and for the price you charge, I expect much, much better.

This place is excellent. Each item was fine dining - either just as I expected or exceeded my presumptions. Family was happy with their seafood salad, seafood fettuccini, crab chowder...the prefix menu I had with short rib, veggies and (subbed in) small/whole potato side dish...whoa, superb flavor.

It was busy as expected when we arrived. We had a 30 or so minute wait but decided to have a few cocktails. They were made well and super tasty! The bartender was polite and made nice small talk while we waited. When we were seated we got a cup of clam chowder to share and it was perfect! No compaints except I wish I had more (my fault for ordering the cup). We decided to get the whole crab and filet mignon with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The crab was delicious and buttery! The steak was the best steak I have ever had before! The potatoes were decadent and kept you coming back! Over all a perfect experience from the food to the service and the views!

When I wrote the review below i was extremely disappointed as you will read. -that said. The management staff contacted me personally and apologized for the experience. I am quite impressed with how they handled the situation and I WILL be back to give it another shot. will say that when I took my wife to the city (a three hour drive) for a great meal on her birthday I expected so much more. Maybe that's why I was disappointed when the waiter was beyond unhelpful and rude. The food? Basic. You could go anywhere and get what you could get here. And what you can't get elsewhere is pre made and waiting to be dished on to your plate. When I pay prices like this for a meal I expect it to be made to order. I was extremely disappointed in the restaurant, the food, and the service. My wife and I actually stopped on the way home and grabbed a real dinner and gave our left over pre made mess to a very happy homeless man. That's the only good that came from this experience. The dinner for my wife's birthday, That we were looking forward too, was the worst meal of our entire trip. Truly disappointed.

Dining at Fisherman's Wharf wasn't my first choice, but we can't always get what we want, can we?Going in, I knew our meal would be overpriced, but I at least hoped it would standout. Unfortunately, it was overpriced and average at best.We hung at the bar while waited for our table and perused the menu, which was more like a catalog; full of pictures, recipes and quite wordy. The ambiance of the overall place is bright, almost too bright; I think some softer lighting would give it a warmer feel.Two of us opted for the prix fixe option. In all the wordiness of the menu, they neglect to mention there are absolutely no substitutions for the prix fixe. You want some chocolate sauce on the vanilla ice cream dessert - nope. Even if you want to pay, the answer is no. You ask if you can get chicken instead of shrimp on the alfredo (on the regular menu) - sorry, Charlie.I started with the house salad. I was told the vinaigrette is homemade and very good. Frankly, I was unimpressed with the salad and found the dressing bland, as if it was heavy on oil and light on vinegar. My entree was the crab alfredo. It was good, but very heavy and rich as most alfredos are. The portion of crab in the dish was very generous, but I got crunchy bites more than once. I imagine it's hard to keep those out. Dessert was the vanilla ice cream, served in a highball. The presentation was vanilla (pun intended), buy the ice cream rich and very tasty. The portion is smaller than what's pictured on the menu, but it was more than enough for us. The person who opted to order from the menu got the chocolate sundae and it was huge, definitely suitable for two.Personally, if I'm going to drop money on seafood in the Wharf, I'm probably going to Scoma's. I prefer the food and ambiance.

As all the reviews state, the views are spectacular. After that, everything else was a step worse with the service being some of the absolute worst I've ever experienced.We had a group of 6. Dinner on Saturday evening. The restaurant was busy, but fine I would think for a restaurant this size in this city.Our waiter arguably didn't serve us. We saw him 3x during a 90 minute dinner - he took our order, came when we asked for someone to send him over, and brought the bill.He didn't bring one item out ("sorry I forgot" and brought out an entree not prepared as requested - which he admitted was a mistake.The crab was great. A bit greasy, but it is crab cooked in butter - yum.Will not return.

We had our New Year's Eve 2017 dinner here.We had a great night (though the place was too crowded). Good thing we were able to make a reservation. We were seated after 10mins passed our reservation (well that's ok). We were seated near the window with the bay view as what I have requested in our reservation. Thanks We had the following:1. 1 whole Roasted Garlic Butter Crab 4.5 stars - size is good for 2 adults and 1 kid who loves fresh crab meat.The Crab is cooked perfectly and tasted so fresh.2. Clam chowder in sourdough bread 3 stars. 3. Iron Skillet Roasted Mussels. 4 stars.We had a very satisfying dinner. We're also thankful for the free toy to make our daughter not bored while waiting for our food.Place is well maintained, with 2 hours parking validation. Friendly customer service. Price is acceptable.

Love the basa with the garlic was really good. Real soft texture. The vegetables create a flawless finish that aligns well with the basa. The restaurant has a great view. The service was also very friendly water was refilled as soon as it was quarter down. Did I mention the view?

As we were walking the piers in San Francisco, we decided it was time to put some seafood in our belly. We noticed a crowd in and around this restaurant so we decided to give it a try. (Side Note: we did check the ratings on YELP.. excellent) As we entered and headed up the stairway, we stopped to see all the photos on the walls of Hollywood's biggest and best actors/actresses of the past. Wow..very cool. We were told it was going to be an hour wait, but if we wanted to sit outside they could seat us immediately. We chose outside, which allowed us to see the entertainment on the boardwalk too. We were seated and offered water, and menus. While reading our menus and watching the entertainment, we decided which drinks we wanted and began choosing our menu selections.My husband had the crab legs and mussels (double order I believe) I had the clam chowder bread bowl... how could I spend a weekend in SF and not get the famous Boudin bread... so that was my choice. (I knew I would sneak some of the hubbys anyway)The waiter showed up and asked what we wanted to drink, and off he went before we could order food too. No worries we figured he would be back soon with our drinks anyway. Well... that was definitely not the case. It was at least 10 min. before he came back and then he took our order. No big deal right? WRONG!!! While the food came out pretty quick, but we had asked him for silverware and he never brought it. My husband had also asked him for hot sauce, again he never brought it. My husband, tired of waiting to eat decided to get it himself. He managed to find hot sauce, but had to find a bus person to find us silverware. Our waiter never came back to find out if everything was okay. Which by the way, the crab and mussels were outstanding. The buttery, garlic flavor was quickly rising as one the best seafood feasts I have ever had. My clam chowder was creamy and full of tasty clams. Whole clams not cut up pieces. The bread was outstanding, and made me want to eat the whole thing. Which I almost would have if not for the hubby wanting some bread with his food. (another note: everyone else had bread on their table while they waited for food, but alas not us) Had it not been for the amazing food we inhaled, I would have given this place -4 stars.We finally saw our waiter again, but only to bring us our bill. Maybe it was because we opted to sit outside, but service should remain the same regardless.

My friend and I had a wonderful birthday lunch yesterday. I had the sourdough clam chowder bowl, which was very delicious. A glass of pi not noir and complimentary sourdough bread with butter was a terrific start. We also were given a yummy bday treat following our meal. The staff was great and our waiter, Loren, was very kind and attentive. Excellent customer service here!

So we were parked on the lot near Fisherman's wharf and noticed that we get a 3 hour parking concession if we ate at one of the neighboring restaurants. Made the mistake of not checking yelp.. Boy oh boy, little did we realize we fell in a bigger $ trap to save few bucks :DEverything was bland and overpriced. Waiter wasnt friendly either.

This is not a fancy restaurant, but it's good for a quick, tasty meal. I had my first cioppino (tomato-based seafood soup/stew) here, and I loved it! My boyfriend had a beignet and said it was ok. He liked the cioppino a lot though.

If you are near by I highly recommend you to go to Franciscan Crab Restaurant.The place is really cool with an amazing views, the service is excellent, prices reasonable and the food is really tasty, probably one of the best seafood in San Francisco.

Came here to celebrate my cousins birthday late September and we enjoyed. We came early and it wasn't busy, but it picked up once we finished our meal. We came during lunch time and it was a hot day in the bay especially in the pier area. I don't think this restaurant has A.C because it got really stuffy inside and people were sweating and complaining. This restaurant was good about seating huge groups and I love the decorations in the building. They have a fresh bread station and they bring some to you while to wait for your food. We ordered a good amount of food and I really liked that their menu did include pictures of the food they have. Therefore you don't have to pull out your phone and yelp out the dish. You could easily decide what you want by looking at their menu. Price was on the expensive side, but do know that you are in the Pier in the tourist area so things will be expensive. I did like the crab was fresh, but the shrimp was on the smaller side. I did order crab sliders and loved it. I was so amazed with the decor and food I ordered. The view of the water and bay area was amazing in the day time. I would definitely like to come back again during dinner time to adore the view of the bay area and food. If you have time and money to spend for a nice meal with family or date do give this place a try.

Crab is very tasty, I would recommend 2 person for a half, otherwise it will taste a little greasy.

Charging 4.9% for some BS "cost of doing business and government mandated expenses" is completely crap! Coming from the most liberal city in the world is laughable! It's a complete scam and they should be held accountable! I will be writing a letter to the BBB and everywhere else I can find to make sure they are notice for the fraudulent charge to their customers.
